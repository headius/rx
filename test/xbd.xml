<p>I should really buckle down and try writing a PHP app because, at the
moment, I have an attitude problem.  I know that IBM now officially loves it,
and Tim O’Reilly’s been
charting the upcurve in PHP book sales, and everyone’s saying that Oracle’s
going to buy Zend.  If you want your ears bent back, have a listen to Zend CEO
Doron Gerstel; he’ll tell you that half the websites in the world are powered
by PHP and that there are 2&#xbd; million developers and that the war is over
and PHP won.
