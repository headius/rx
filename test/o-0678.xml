<p>Our third annual “Lauren and Tim’s New Year’s Day Social” is history.
Forty or so people, plus as many as nine simultaneous kids, went through some
<a href="http://www.mumm.com/eng/champ/ch_chrouge.htm">pretty good
champagne</a>, juices, gazpacho, lentil soup, dips, and so on, and did a whole
lot of talking.
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/09/25/Marlowe">Marlowe</a>, who’s now six
months old, astounded us by sticking around and chilling with the crowd,
apparently enjoying the buzz.  Thanks all for coming, and for those who
brought bottles of wine and other bonuses, that’s really totally unnecessary
but thanks anyhow.  I enclose a photo of the aftermath.</p>
<img src="IMGP2876.jpg" alt="The kitchen after the party" />
<p>This is about a third of the kitchen counter space; the rest looked the same,
the chaos visually impressive.  Still, the cleanup is pretty
light work by any reasonable standard.  I think we’ll go on doing this.</p>
<p>Hint; if you want to throw this kind of an affair and find yourself
wondering “What will they drink out of?”, you could rent stuff, but that’s
awkward and expensive; or you could go to your local IKEA and load up on very
decent champagne flutes and soup bowls at pennies apiece.
The choice is obvious.</p>

<body>
<p>As a member of the
<a href="http://telsociety.org.uk/telsociety/index.htm">T. E. Lawrence
Society</a> and a participant in the
<a href="http://hermes.gwu.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A0=telawrence">TEL studies mailing
list</a>, I’m happy to
announce the arrival of
<a href="http://telawrence.net/">telawrence.net</a>.  
Lawrence died in 1935 and UK copyright survives its author by 70 years, so
his writing is now out of copyright.  This is the work of Jeremy Wilson,
biographer and student 
of TEL, and a fine thing it is; thanks Jeremy!
We look forward, in the near future, to the arrival of large volumes of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T.E._Lawrence#Lawrence_the_author">TEL’s
writings</a>; he was prolific.
I’m pondering the possibility, once things get going, of a TEL periodical
along the lines of the 
<a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/">Pepys Diary</a>; Lawrence was not a
diarist but he was a prolific correspondent; I suspect that the entry density
would be plentiful enough to support a blog format.</p>

<title>Velodyne MiniVee</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A year ago last fall, we got a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/05/KrashTV">plasma TV for high-def</a>;
90% of the time it’s on, it’s tuned to a sports event.  So sound quality, even
for a confirmed audio weenie like me, just wasn’t a big deal, and I plugged in
a pair of excellent little
<a href="http://www.psbspeakers.com/">PSB</a> Alpha speakers, $299 or so if I
recall correctly, and they were plenty good enough.
The only problem was, where the TV’s sitting there’s hardly any room to spare
either side of the screen, and the PSBs stuck out in an ugly and awkward
way.  So I dropped by the Boxing Day sale at
<a href="http://soundplus.ca/">Sound Plus</a>, my friendly local high-end
salon, and picked up a couple of decent little 
<a href="http://www.kef.com/">KEF</a> mini-speakers that fit in beside the
screen and sound perfectly decent if you don’t ask them to play any low notes,
which I left to a
<a href="http://www.velodyne.com/velodyne/products/product.aspx?ID=14&amp;sid=447n340d">MiniVee</a> subwoofer from
<a href="http://www.velodyne.com/">Velodyne</a> and I have to say, it’s a
honey.
Rather than using the specialized subwoofer feed, I ran the preamp-out
line-level signals from the nice old
<a href="http://nadelectronics.com/">NAD</a> integrated amp through the
Velodyne and back to the power-in, which has the useful side-effect of rolling
off the signal at 80Hz, so the little KEFs don’t have to waste energy trying
to go where they can’t.
The Velodyne has a clever circuit where it powers down and wakes up when it
sees an input signal.
It sounds good; not close to the 
<a href="http://www.totemacoustic.com/english/products/floorStanding_forest.htm">Totem
Forests</a> on the big music-only system; but for the price, remarkable.
I’m sitting here typing this listening to the
<a href="http://www.galaxie.ca/en/1/chan_view.php?ID=5">Ambient</a> channel
from
<a href="http://www.galaxie.ca/">Galaxie</a> (that’d be channel 904 if you’re
on the
<a href="http://www.starchoice.ca/">Star Choice</a> satellite), and while
admittedly it’s brain goo not music, it’s very silky-sounding goo that’s also
giving me a friendly kidney massage on the low notes.</p>

<title>Dell Monitors</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Just to prove that I can say nice things about Dell:
Mom visited us over Christmas, and is thinking about
replacing the the mouldy old 15" CRT plugged into her
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/08/27/New-Mac-for-Mom">new Mac mini</a>.  So
we walked around the local electronics megamart and looked at the HP and
Samsung and LG screens, which seemed much of a muchness.  At home,
we went over to the Dell Canada monitors page, and wow, they were
<em>slaughtering</em> the big-box store; way better specs for noticeably
less money.  I’ve seen the Dell screens and they’re good, and decently styled
too.  I told her the old trick of bookmarking the page and monitoring the
price every day or two  
for a few weeks until you learn to spot the patterns and strike when there’s a
deal, and I bet Dell gets her business.
<i>[Update: I wrote this last week, then saw 
Jeremy Zawodny’s
<a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/006009.html">anguished
Dell-hell howl</a>;
I’ve decided not to shriek “Stop!” at Mom because, after all, most of the
screens aren’t going to arrive broken.]</i></p>

<title>Jazz in 2005</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Just now I watched an hour of the 2005
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Jazz_Festival">Newport Jazz
Festival</a> on PBS HD, and I think it probably said something about the state
of jazz.  The order of the comments does not correspond to the 
concert’s running order.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wynton_Marsalis">Wynton Marsalis</a>
(hmm, there seem to be two official competing sites, so we’ll go with
Wikipedia) erected a perfectly-polished entirely-motionless 100%
risk-free monument to some idealized notion of the Golden Age of Jazz; his
ensemble all wore really great neckties.
The
<a href="http://www.joshuaredman.com/">Joshua Redman Elastic Band</a> opened
with some interesting heavily-processed solo sax,
then played conventional quite-OK jazz flawed only by
Joshua Redman, whose breaks were kind of boring.
<a href="http://www.mmw.net/">Martin Medeski and Wood</a>, whom I’d heard of
but never heard, played fast 
complicated synth-funk,
which is generally a disposable kind of thing, but it was actually a fairly
<em>funky</em> flavor of synth-funk, so that’s a redeeming feature.
The <a href="http://www.daveholland.com/">Dave Holland</a> Big Band was
refreshing, straight un-pimped-up jazz, but high-speed, high-energy, the
players were sweating and some of the breaks veered into dangerous territory.
Mmmm, tasty.
Saving the best for the last: The
<a href="http://www.patriciabarber.com/">Patricia Barber Quartet</a> played
<cite>Norwegian Wood</cite>.  No, that’s not what they did... 
actually they fucking blew the stage to
smithereens, caressing the song, then easing into the instrumental space, then
offering apocalyptic piano and bass breaks, then dropping into a fast ensemble
groove, pure rhythm for the sake of rhythm, why couldn’t it have gone on for
an hour; a penultimate dip into that tart Lennon/McCartney sweetness and then
it ended with a big loud bang.
I’ve been listening to a lot of jazz for a lot of years; for my money, the
Barber quartet is by a wide margin the world’s premier currently-active jazz
ensemble.  Maybe the premier currently-active ensemble in any genre of music.

<body>
<p>I’m happy to announce that sometime in early 2007,
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL">David Berlind</a> will be
buying me a nice dinner.
Today, David wrote
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=2324#comments">a piece</a> noting that
<a href="http://www.lattix.com/">Lattix</a> 
(interesting outfit, by the way, check out the demo) 
is joining Eclipse, and concluding
“Is it time for NetBeans to finally throw in the towel?”  
Misguided of him, I thought.  So I’ve proposed a bet: we’ll have a nice dinner
together first time in ’07 that we’re in the same city.
If, at that time, David still thinks that throwing in the NetBeans towel is a
good idea, I’ll buy dinner.  Otherwise he buys.
Fortunately for David, my tastes in food and wine are fairly plebian.</p>

<title>Upcoming Gig: XBRL San Jose</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>On Wednesday Jan. 18th I’ll be at Adobe in San Jose talking at the
<a href="http://www.xbrl.org/us/events/">XBRL Meeting</a>.  XBRL is 
about something
that I’ve long felt is important: standardizing financial reporting.
I’ve struggled a whole lot over the years with accounting principles and
financial reporting, which are generally speaking a snake-pit.  Those of us
who’ve dealt with this stuff were less surprised by Enron and friends,
because “Generally Accepted Accounting Principles” have historically included
lots of latitude for egregious lies.
The best answer is transparency, give intelligent investors enough information
and they’ll sniff out the bad guys.  Getting from the mess we’re now in to
complete transparency has two essential steps: first of all, the regulators
have to make Generally Accepted Accounting Lies punishable with lots of jail
time.  Secondly, we need technical infrastructure so we can build some
standardized tools to do financial analysis; these exist today, but require a
whole lot of hand-tweaking to weed through the GAAP-approved hand-waving and
make one company’s numbers comparable to another’s.  XBRL isn’t the solution,
but’s 
an important piece of the puzzle, and if there’s anything I can do to help,
I’m there.</p>

<title>PHP Calendar Fun</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Here’s the problem:
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Dr. Wood</a> and I both have
complicated jobs plus we have a
family, so just like everyone else in the world, keeping in sync is a problem.
Herewith a painful half-finished story of trying to solve it with technology.
The conclusion is painfully obvious: whoever first provides a
family-scheduling tool that non-geeks can use and Just Works with the tools
most people run their calendars on is going to make a lot of money and do
Humanity a major service.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Informal Approaches</h2>
<p>Chat is a godsend; a high proportion of the times when I get a phone call
saying “Can you go to Kalamazoo in April?” Lauren’s online and we can work it
out right there... but other times, not; and she gets about as many of those
calls.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>What we’d like is a way to share calendar info back and forth so
that it updates automatically and I can look at hers and she can look at mine and (this part is important)
nobody else can look at either.</p>
<p>Sun has an excellent
Web-based calendaring service but our calendars include all sorts of personal
and family stuff that we don’t feel like sharing with the employer.
iCal can publish to .mac but then everyone can see it.</p>
<p>Her calendar’s on Palm and mine’s on iCal, and our
family server’s a Debian box.  
To increase the nastiness, I insist on
keeping my calendar back to the day in 1996 when I got my first Palm Pilot,
plus now I stretch the custom-repeat scheduling capability of iCal to the max;
thus my .ics file is about 800K, and has reduced more than one highly-regarded
calendar-interchange program to quivering fragments.</p>
<p>Short version: Getting co-ordinated turns out to be a
remarkable amount of work. </p>
<h2 id='p-3'>PHP iCalendar</h2>
<p>Anyhow, I solved half of it this evening.  Acting on the wise advice of
<a href="http://www.webmink.net/">Simon Phipps</a>, I decided to try
<a href="http://phpicalendar.net/">PHP iCalendar</a>.   Of course, this
required getting WebDAV going on our Debian box, which is a <strong>MAJOR PAIN
IN 
THE BUTT</strong>, lots of things don’t work out of the box.  But there’s help
online, and when things go wrong (they will) you’ll need to <br/>
<code>apt-get install cadaver</code> and look at your Apache error log and
paste error messages into search engines, and
you’ll eventually get it working.
If setting up an Atom server ends up being this much pain, I will have wasted
the last two years of my life.</p>
<p>Of course, then you’re into the Joy of PHP.
Which confounds me; I go pretty deep on Perl, which means I’m inured to some
level of obfuscation, but dammit, does PHP have to be <em>quite</em> so
butt-ugly?</p>
<p>PHP iCalendar is a good example of the PHP conundrum.  It’s ugly,
it’s gross, it’s inefficient, but today I have my calendar robustly online and
yesterday I didn’t.  Did I say inefficient?  The home Debian box is a
mouldy old P300 or some such, and it takes PHP about a minute of CPU time to
read 800K of .ics and draw a (very nice) HTML picture of one of my
weeks.  That’s after I had to figure out how to whack the PHP config file to
double the allowed memory and time consumption.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>The Palm Half</h2>
<p>Lauren’s been grinding her gears finding something that will read her Palm
calendar file and put it on the web where I can see it.
Currently the leading
candidate is
<a href="http://www.k5n.us/webcalendar.php">WebCalendar</a> (another PHP app;
do you spot a pattern here?); unfortunately it’s currently blowing chunks
on her Palm schedule, which isn’t nearly as big or nasty as mine.
But I’m sure she’ll figure it out.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Throwing Iron</h2>
<p>What’s going to happen?  Eventually we’ll get both halves working.
I suspect that our joint calendrical activities will then reduce that 
poor old P300 to smoking rubble, and we’ll end up buying an Ultra or
something to make it all go.</p>
<p>As an employee of a server vendor, this cheers me and makes me want to go
look for ways to encourage PHP’s poorly-concealed Plot for World
Domination... I envision vast server rooms full of Opteron and Niagara boxes
and terabytes of RAM grinding away on synchronizing family schedules in PHP7.
I see places where they have big families, like Afghanistan and Utah, as
opportunities to drive up our share price.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, as a software engineer, I feel mildly nauseated.</p>
<p>But the family’s getting in sync; how can that be a bad thing?</p>

<title>Hockey and America</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I managed to catch a few of the games in the just-completed
World Junior Hockey Championship.  If I’d been more organized I might have
been able
to go to some of them since they were right here in town, but hockey
turns out to be excellent HDTV fare and
it was terrific entertainment.
While we
<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/story/sports/national/2006/01/05/Sports/canada_russsia_final060105.html">won
the final 5-0</a>, that wasn’t fair to the Russians, who were a strong, fast,
skilled team; they had at least as much talent as the Canadians.  I think 
they were out-coached; plus our goalie Justin Pogge, whom
nobody’d ever heard of before, went into brick-wall mode in the first third or
so of the game, against a mere human there would have been two or three or more
Russian goals. 
Anyhow, once you got past Canada and Russia, the other really good team in the
tournament was the USA.  And here’s what’s weird and disturbing: the
mostly-Canadian audiences were actively cheering for anyone playing
against the US, and occasionally booing the Americans.  
Granted, economically-literate Canadians are mad at the US for egregious
NAFTA abuse, and we’re terrified of the consequences of our neighbor’s lunatic
fiscal and trade deficits.  
And of course, from the mushy Canadian cultural centre,
Dubya and the neotheocons seem like beings from an alien planet.
While, like most 
Canadians, I disapprove of many actions of the current US administration, 
like most Canadians I also like most Americans.
And it’s just moronic to take out political gripes on a bunch of eager,
dedicated, young athletes.
But having said that, if there were any doubt that the USA has a
major public-relations problem, booing hockey fans a half-hour over the
border should dispel it.</p>

<title>Canada’s Election</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Our politics haven’t historically been famous for gripping drama;
after all, the national motto is “Peace, Order, and good Government”.  But the
<a href="http://www.elections.ca/home.asp?textonly=false">current edition</a>
is getting really interesting.  I’m neither
terribly enthusiastic nor disillusioned about our political system, a typical
first-past-the-post Parliamentary elected dictatorship.  One thing,
though, is absolutely wonderful: 
our elections are over in a few weeks.  The current edition, with the Christmas
break in the middle, is unusually long. I had to feel sorry for the
politicos out campaigning in December; not only is the weather brutal, but in
most of the country, most of the voters were busy getting ready for Christmas
and thus totally not paying attention.
If you want to follow, I find that journoblogger
<a href="http://andrewcoyne.com/">Andrew Coyne</a> provides a good
vantage-point on the campaign.
What’s happening is that the Liberals, often regarded as the Natural Governing
Party, have fallen behind in the polls.  The Conservatives (“Tories”) have
done poorly in recent elections because the Liberals successfully painted them
in scary GOP-clone colours, creating fear that they’d privatize
healthcare, ban abortion, oppress gays, end gun control, get us into
Republican wars, and shut
down immigration.  They were helped by the fact that the Tories had
a few outspoken dinosaurs who apparently wanted to do precisely those
things.  
This time, there are two big differences.
First, most of the country is really,
really irritated at the Liberals for their long-time culture of insider
patronage and for recently having been caught engaging in overt bribery and
kickbacks.  In fact, if they hadn’t been doing a reasonably competent job of
running the country, they’d be on their way to the political graveyard.
Second, the Tories have their right-wing crazies firmly under control and are
sounding level-headed, sensible, and un-radical.  
It looks like the voters may well give ’em
a chance.  Mind you, there are still 16 days of campaigning and a lot can
change.</p>

<title>Don’t Invent XML Languages</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The X in XML stands for “Extensible”; one big selling point is that you
can invent your own XML languages to help you solve your own problems.  But
I’ve become convinced, over the last couple of years, that you shouldn’t.
Unless you <em>really</em> have to.  This piece explains why.
And, there’s a companion piece entitled
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/09/On-XML-Language-Design">On XML Language
Design</a>, in case you do really have to.</p>
<p>Even though I’ve spent time recently helping invent
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4287">an XML language</a>, please lay off
the cries of hypocrisy.  I’m not chiefly a language designer, and if I can lay
claim to any special expertise, it’s primarily as the <em>user</em> of a whole
bunch of different XML languages.  Too many, in fact; that’s the point.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Neither Easy Nor Fun</h2>
<p>Designing XML Languages is <em>hard</em>.  
It’s boring, political, time-consuming, unglamorous, irritating work.
It always takes longer than you think it will, and when you’re finished,
there’s always this feeling that you could have done more or should have done
less or got some detail essentially wrong.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Pass/Fail Ratio</h2>
<p>At Robin Cover’s invaluable
<a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/">XML Cover Pages</a>, he’s assembled a
helpful list of
<a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/xmlApplications.html">known XML
languages</a>, which currently has about 600 members.
I’m sure Robin wouldn’t claim the list is comprehensive, these are the just
the ones that have crossed his radar.</p>
<p>Looking at the list, I have a question: <em>How many of them matter?</em></p>
<p>Have a look at the list; what do you think?
I think it’s a <em>lot</em> less than 600.  Let’s rephrase that question:
<em>How many achieved their designers’ objectives?</em>  Same answer, I
think.</p>
<p>The conclusion is obvious; if you embark on designing a new XML language,
there’s a substantial probability that your effort will not be rewarded with
success.</p>
<p><i>[Sidebar: Of course, to mitigate that risk, when you’ve finished
designing your 
language, you have to take your show on the road and sell that sucker.
You can no more hope to succeed without marketing than can any other technology.
Some of us <em>like</em> marketing and selling, so for us this is not a big
downside.  But it will be for others.]</i></p>
<p>So right there is a good reason not to embark on this kind of thing: it’s
really hard, really time-consuming, and there’s an excellent chance that it
won’t produce the results you were hoping for.
In this life it’s generally a good idea to stay away from projects which are
difficult, unpleasant, and have a high chance of failure.
And so far I’ve just talked about the personal expenditure of time.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Software Pain</h2>
<p>If you’re going to design a new language, you’re committing to a major
investment in software development.  First, you’ll need a validator.  Don’t
kid yourself that writing a schema will do the trick; any nontrivial language
will have a whole lot of constraints that you can’t check in a schema
language, and any nontrivial language needs an automated validator if you’re
going to get software to interoperate.
Second, <em>if</em> you’re designing a language that will be human-authored,
you’re going to have to arrange for there to be authoring software.  This
either means writing an authoring package from scratch (we’re talking huge
money and time and pain), or customizing one of the generalized XML-authoring
tools, which is only moderately-less-huge time and money and pain.
Finally, there’s the payload software; you wouldn’t be designing a language if
you didn’t want to do something with it, other than author and validate it.
Someone’s going to have to write that software.  Software is expensive.</p>
<p>But there are other, more important reasons not to invent languages,
starting with the network 
effect.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Restating Metcalfe</h2>
<p>Bob Metcalfe, that is, who invented Ethernet and is a really smart guy and
will probably be known
to history mostly as the originator of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_Law">Metcalfe’s Law</a>:
The value of a network is proportional approximately to the
square of the number of nodes.</p>
<p>Here’s a related law: The value of a markup language is proportional
approximately to the square of the number of different software
implementations that can process it.
I could argue this from theory but would prefer to do so by example: HTML.
RSS.  PDF.  (And, I’m betting on Atom and XMPP and ODF pretty soon). Convinced
yet?
HTML can be used by robotic link followers as well as human-oriented rendering
engines.   RSS/Atom feeds can be used by event trackers as well as desktop
news aggregators.  Apple can build a
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/pdf/">PDF reader that’s better
than Adobe’s</a>.</p>
<p>In case it isn’t already obvious, this is why I’m such a hardcore partisan
of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument">ODF</a> and so irritated by
Microsoft’s refusal to get behind this particular network effect.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>Opportunity Cost</h2>
<p>I’ve already mentioned that developing an XML language is time-consuming
(I’ve never seen it done in less than a year), and then you get to start
writing the software that’s going to do whatever it is you need done with that
language.
But presumably you need that whatever-it-is done right now, or you wouldn’t be
working on that problem.  Are you prepared to live with the multi-year cost of
developing the language and then implementing the software around it?</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>The Big Five</h2>
<p>Suppose you’ve got an application where a markup language would be handy,
and you’re wisely resisting the temptation to build your own.
What are you going to do, then?</p>
<p>The smartest thing to do would be to find a way to use one of the perfectly
good markup languages that have been designed and debugged and have validators
and authoring software and parsers and generators and all that other good
stuff.
Here’s a radical idea: don’t even think of making your own language until
you’re sure that you can’t do the job using one of the Big Five:
XHTML, DocBook, ODF, UBL, and Atom.</p>
<h3 id='p-9'>XHTML + Microformats</h3>
<p>If you’re delivering information to humans over the Web, even if you don’t
think of it as “Web Pages”, it’s almost certainly insane not to use XHTML.
Yes, XHTML is semantically weak and doesn’t really grok 
hierarchy and has a bunch of other problems.
That’s OK, because it has a general-purpose <code>class</code> attribute and
ignores 
markup it doesn’t know about and you can bastardize it eight ways from center
without anything breaking.  The Kool Kids call this “Microformats” and in fact
I accidentally
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/11/12/Resume-Blues">invented one</a> on 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> last November; look at that template and its
<code>class</code> attributes.</p>
<p>And of course, if you use XHTML you can feed it to the browsers that are
already there on a few hundred million desktops and humans can read it, and if
they want to know how to do what it’s doing, they can “View Source”—these are
powerful arguments.</p>
<h3 id='p-10'>DocBook</h3>
<p>Suppose you’re building something that needs to go bigger and deeper and
richer than XHTML is comfy with, and you want to repurpose it for print and
electronic and voice, and you need chapters and sections and appendices and
bibliographies and footnotes and so on.
DocBook is what you need.  It’s got everything you could possibly begin to
imagine already built-in, and there are lots of good tools out there to do
useful things with it.</p>
<h3 id='p-11'>ODF</h3>
<p>Suppose you’re working with material that’s going to have a lot of workflow
around it, and be complex, visually if not structurally, and maybe some day
will be printed out and have signatures at the bottom.  ODF is what you want.
Not the most Web-oriented approach, but on the other hand the authoring tools
are more human-friendly than anything else on this list.</p>
<h3 id='p-14'>UBL</h3>
<p>If you’re working with invoices and purchase orders and that kind of stuff
(and who isn’t?), do not even think of inventing anything.
A whole bunch of smart people have put hundreds of person-years into pulling
together the basics, and they did a good job, and it’s ready to go today.
Look no further.</p>
<h3 id='p-12'>Atom</h3>
<p>Suppose you think of your data as a list of, well, anything: stock prices
or workflow steps or cake ingredients or sports statistics.
Atom might be for you. 
Suppose the things in the list ought to have human-readable labels and have to
carry a 
timestamp and might be re-aggregated into other lists.  Atom is almost
certainly what you need.
And for a data format that didn’t exist a year ago, there’s a whole great big
butt-load of software that understands it.</p>
<h2 id='p-13'>To the Managers Out There</h2>
<p>The next time one of your technical superstars comes into the room and says
“We gotta design an XML vocabulary for X”, make them <em>prove</em> they can’t
do it with one of the Big Five.  And if they can prove it, sigh deeply and
budget a couple of years’ delay, and a few thousand more engineering hours.</p>

<title>On XML Language Design</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>If you’re going to be designing a new XML language, first of all, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/08/No-New-XML-Languages">consider
not doing it</a>.  But if you really have to, this piece discusses the
problems you’re apt to face and offers some advice on improving your chances
of success.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Expect Semantic Gaps</h2>
<p>“There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and
naming things” said
<a href="http://karlton.hamilton.com/">Phil Karlton</a>.
Designing an XML vocabulary is all about agreeing on names for things, and
thus it’s hard.</p>
<p>The disease’s symptoms are semantic gaps, painfully familiar to
anyone who’s done application integration at a large scale.  
It’s astounding how similar-sounding things can have completely different
meanings; the example that burns brightest in my mind right now happened in
the Atom Working Group last year; we spun our wheels for weeks and weeks
trying to agree what an entry’s “Last-Updated” date really meant.  No, I’m not
kidding.</p>
<p>Agreeing on what the objects you’re dealing with is are, and on what to name
them, is often a process that can try the patience of saints; and few saints
are engaged in XML language building.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Manage the Process</h2>
<p>Language design is a business process.  It’s not quite like product
development or marketing-campaign design or negotiating an OEM contract,
but it’s not entirely unlike any of those things.  Thus, it needs to be
managed, and a crucial component of success is the management quality.</p>
<p>This means that if you are running one of these, you’ll need to focus on
good old-fashioned business values like accountability, transparency, 
goal-setting, and
information sharing.  Each and every language-design effort has the potential
to blow through its deadlines and trail along forever, and offers many chances
to fall into the
<a href="http://www.unixguide.net/freebsd/faq/16.19.shtml">bikeshed</a>
trap.</p>
<p>A good standards process manager has to be impatient, courteous, skilled at
listening, and good at relentless polite follow-ups to hold people to their
commitments, because many of the people involved in these processes are doing
it in their spare time or would rather be doing something else.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>The Syntax-vs-Model Wars</h2>
<p>There are two completely different (and fairly incompatible) ways of
thinking about language invention.  The first, which I’ll call syntax-centric,
focuses on the language itself: what the tags and attributes are, and
which can contain which, and what order they have to be in, and (even more
important) on the human-readable prose that describes what they mean and what
software ought to do with them.  The second approach, which I’ll call
model-centric, focuses on agreeing on a formal model of the data objects which
captures as much of their semantics as possible; then
the details of the language should fall out.</p>
<p>My description of the two sides cannot hope to be fair, since I am firmly
in the syntax-and-prose camp, and frequently am simply unable to understand
the diagrams produced by the data modeling tools.
Having said that, even someone who is generally leery of
model-centric design can occasionally appreciate the benefits of
formalisms: Mark Pilgrim wrote up
<a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/08/20/dive.html">a very nice
explanation</a> of how RDF-based modeling clarified some of the design of
Atom.</p>
<p>Whichever approach you take, be warned: a conflict between these approaches
will quite likely arise, and will be made worse by the fact that many members
of both camps don’t see a reason for the other camp to exist.</p>
<h2 id='p-9'>Minimalism vs. Completeness</h2>
<p>The single most important decision regarding the design of a new language
is “How big is it?”  Which is to say, how much of the problem does it try to
solve?  Where are the design goals on the spectrum ranging from bare-minimum
at one end through nicely-balanced to complete-solution at the other end?</p>
<p>On this issue, I’ll put my heart on my sleeve and quote
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gall's_law">Gall’s Law</a>: <i>A complex
system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system
that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be
patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple
system.</i></p>
<p>I think the number-one thing that makes language-design projects fail is
overreaching, completism, trying to be, in Gall’s terms, “a complex system
designed from scratch.”
There are a bunch of good solid explanations why the world works this way; my
favorite comes from the world of Extreme Programming and it goes like this:
until you’ve implemented and deployed a feature, you don’t <em>really</em>
understand it.  So don’t try to build multiple layers of features on things
you don’t really understand.</p>
<p>I’ve made the same point from another angle in my
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/01/03/TPM1">Technology
Predictor Success Matrix</a> series, especially in
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/01/14/TPSM-8020">The
80/20 Point</a>.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of cute slogans that apply here: “Dare to do less”,
“MPRDV: The Minimum Progress Required to Declare Victory”,  “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better">Worse is better</a>”,
and “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAGNI">YAGNI</a>” are some of
them.</p>
<p>Ignore this at your peril.  But it’s is not an absolute; the W3C’s
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery/">XQuery</a> effort seems like it’s
actually going to be finished this year, and actually be used; the process has
taken
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TandS/QL/QL98/">over five years</a> elapsed and
consumed probably a hundred person-years on the part of smart, senior,
people.  Maybe it will have been worth it.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Evolution vs. Stability</h2>
<p>After the completeness issue, and closely related to it, the next Really
Big Question you’ll have to face is about evolution.
That is to say, when you ship release 1.0 of your new language, are you going
to disband your working group, or immediately get to work on the next
release?</p>
<p>This is not a slam-dunk; there are lots of problems that need multi-level
solutions, so you want to do one level at a time.  In other cases, you get
urgent feedback from the field on release 1.0 that makes it obvious that there
just has to be a release 2.0.</p>
<p>Having said that, the advantages to stopping with 1.0 are huge.
Here’s why: one of the main success factors for a new XML language is how much
software there is out there that does useful things with it.  (See my proposed 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/08/No-New-XML-Languages#p-4">restatement of
Metcalfe’s law</a> over in the companion piece.)
And software developers love a stable target above all things.  If you publish
1.0 of your language and are fortunate enough to get some uptake in the
developer community so
some useful tools are shipping, bear in mind that if you then release 2.0,
you’ve quite likely broken all those tools.  You can maybe do this once before
the developers are going to start seeing you as part of the problem rather
than as part of the solution.  They might just give up on you, or they might
decide to go on maintaining their 1.0-compatible releases and simply ignore
your 2.0, which will then likely go un-used.  This is more or less exactly
what happened to
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml11/">XML 1.1</a> which, despite having my
name on the cover, I thought was a bad idea and fought every step of the
way.</p> 
<p>Having said all that, the job is not over once you’ve shipped 1.0; the
world changes, and if what you’ve built is useful, people will want to use it
in new, different, unforeseen applications, and in ways you didn’t predict.
This is a good thing; a symptom of success.</p>
<p>Rather than having your Working Group
endlessly revising the language to keep up with the world, I’d recommend
arranging 
that people who want to add stuff to solve their problems can do it,
without asking you and without breaking anything.  This is called
“Extensibility”.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>Extensibility</h2>
<p>The experience of the Web, and the currently-in-progress exploration of the
Web Services territory, has led to a lot of people thinking intensely about
extensibility, and some powerful lessons have been learned.</p>
<p>If you’re going to be designing an XML language, you owe it to yourself to
do some of this thinking yourself, if you want it to have any kind of
future.</p>
<p>The two most important things to think about are called “MustIgnore” and
“MustUnderstand”, and they mean about what they sound like; while they
encapsulate fine old engineering principles, as labels they are new things in
the world, only having achieved common currency in recent years.</p>
<h3 id='p-10'>MustIgnore</h3>
<p>This was an unstated axiom of the World Wide Web.  
When a browser runs across a weird, unknown tag, it just ignores it.
This fact allowed the explosive multidirectional growth of HTML technology
back in the nineties.  Anybody shipping a browser could, and many did,
introduce weird new tags that did weird new things.  If people liked what they
did, the other browsers would pick them up.  Meanwhile, nothing broke, because
of the unwritten MustIgnore.</p>
<p>Here’s how MustIgnore is stated in a modern XML language design, Atom 1.0,
from section 6.3 of
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4287">RFC 4287</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Atom Processors that encounter foreign markup in a location that is
   legal according to this specification MUST NOT stop processing or
   signal an error.  It might be the case that the Atom Processor is
   able to process the foreign markup correctly and does so.  Otherwise,
   such markup is termed “unknown foreign markup”.</p>
<p>When unknown foreign markup is encountered as a child of atom:entry,
   atom:feed, or a Person construct, Atom Processors MAY bypass the
   markup and any textual content and MUST NOT change their behavior as
   a result of the markup's presence.</p>
<p>When unknown foreign markup is encountered in a Text Construct or
   atom:content element, software SHOULD ignore the markup and process
   any text content of foreign elements as though the surrounding markup
   were not present.</p></blockquote>
<p>The notion there of “foreign markup” is a interesting.  In Atom, it
includes both markup from other non-Atom namespaces and markup from the Atom
namespace that’s not defined in the RFC.
In another situation, you might want to distinguish between the two.</p>
<p>But note that this would in principle allow the creation of an an “Atom
2.0” in the same namespace without breaking old software.</p>
<h3 id='p-11'>MustUnderstand</h3>
<p>This is the opposite of MustIgnore; you use it when you add an extension to
an existing language that you don’t want ignored.
For example, maybe you’ve got a new security policy and you don’t want anyone
acting on messages unless they’ve been signed with this year’s newer and better
digital-signature technology.
So you’d have something built into the base language so that when you include 
one of the new digital signatures in a message there’s a way to say “Do not
process this message unless you can verify this signature.”</p>
<p>There are a variety of ways to do MustUnderstand; in SOAP, any field in the
message header can have a MustUnderstand flag saying that if you don’t
understand that field, you can’t do anything with the whole message.
In practice this turns out to be awkward, since a SOAP message can have a lot
of headers, and you can’t act on any of them until you’ve read them all
because there might be a lurking MustUnderstand.</p>
<p>We were considering a MustUnderstand for Atom, and were thinking of
something much simpler: one MustUnderstand element at the top of the document
with a list of namespace names, and if software found any namespaces there it
couldn’t handle, it was not to proceed.</p>
<p>But in the end we decided to leave MustUnderstand out of Atom.  I think
that was the right decision; there are going to be some languages where you’ll
need it, but be aware that it adds real complexity to implementors’
lives.   Also, at the end of the day it’s hard to enforce not only in theory
but in practice: telling programmers who’ve already received a message that
they’re not allowed to process it may not produce the results you expect.</p>
<p>If it seems like I’ve put more effort into extensibility than everything
else put together, that’s because I have, because I think it’s important.
If you want to dive a whole lot deeper, look
<a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/12/03/versioning.html">here</a> or
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/versioning-20031003">here</a>; both
have Dave Orchard’s fingerprints on them, which is appropriate because he’s
thought about it a whole lot.</p>
<h2 id='p-8'>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Good luck! You’ll need it.</p>

<title>Rain and Silence and Reggaetón</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>If it lasts through Sunday, Vancouver (and Seattle just down the road) will
break a 1953 record for continuous rainy days.  Recently there’s not much
rattling around inside asking to be written and I partly blame all those
clouds and, weirdly, the fact that
it’s been weeks since I saw anything that I wanted to take a picture of.
I have this great big queue of interesting Web stuff to write about, but you
know, if I don’t someone else will and if they don’t it probably didn’t
need writing.  The Web’s like that.  But today I was driving up 101 heading
for SFO and didn’t like what KFOG was playing and hit Seek and listened to
half an hour of
<a href="http://www.univision.com/content/channel.jhtml?chid=9598&amp;schid=9793">La
Kalle</a> which plays
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggaeton">Reggaetón</a>, and the DJs
veer back and forth between Spanish and English three times in the average
hyperenthusiastic sentence.  The music’s complicatedly trying to be
Latino-sentimental and hip-hop-tough and reggae-happy all at once, which
leaves gaps it occasionally falls into, 
but more of it is good than bad, and a couple of times it had
me hoppin’ back and forth on my butt in the driver’s seat.  When I stopped to
gas up the rental the song they were playing was too good to turn off so I
cranked that sucker and entertained the whole gas station while I did my bit
for the Saudi economy.
A young dude in a good blue suit and haircut gassing <em>his</em> rental
raised an eyebrow 
at the grey-bearded gringo honkey gettin’ down.  As if I cared.</p>

<p>Subtitled <i>How Blogs are Changing the Way Businesses Talk with
Customers</i>, 
by Robert Scoble and Shel Israel.
I got an advance copy of this a couple of months ago, with a note saying “Can
we have a quote for the cover by Wednesday?”  But I didn’t get
around to reading it until several Wednesdays later.
Summary: Lots of people will benefit from reading this; especially
“Communications Professionals”.  Most people who read 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> won’t learn much, but they might enjoy it
anyhow.  Read on for more details.</p>
<img src="NC.png" class="inline" alt="Naked Conversations" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Good Stuff</h2>
<p>The best thing is that there’s little abstraction or theorizing; it’s all
real stories about real people and their ventures into the blogosphere.
They do draw some lessons, but never at too-great length, and it never reads
like they’re lecturing.</p>
<p>Another strong point is that there’s first-rate coverage of business
blogging outside of North America.  Granted, there isn’t very much of that
happening yet, but some of the stories—in particular, the stories out of
France—are rich with lessons that I think would apply anywhere.
Some of those stories are 100% new to me and would be, I suspect, to most of
my readers.</p>
<p>Their conclusion is bold and one I agree with, although probably a little
bit in advance of all the evidence being in: Blogging is good for good
companies and bad for bad companies.  Disclosure: I’m pretty sure that I
didn’t invent that phrase, which
doesn’t actually appear in <cite>Naked Conversations</cite>; I seem to recall
reading it somewhere but can’t find the reference.</p>
<p>My personal favorite fragment, unsurprisingly, is the one I appear in: <i>One
competitor we know about, speaking off the record, told us “We had counted Sun
out.  We assumed by now they would be dead or irrelevant.  They’re back.  I
think it’s their [expletive deleted] blogs.  We just went into a customer
meeting and they were asking us about some stuff that Tim Bray had posted that
morning.”</i>
So far, Scoble has politely ignored my whining, begging, pleading, and offers
of huge bribes to find out who the competitor is.  Hmm... I wonder if
Maryam can be subverted?</p>
<p>Another really good thing is that while <cite>Naked Conversations</cite>
unabashedly sings the virtues of blogging, it tries hard to avoid being sucked
into uncritical boosterism, pointing specifically at cases where what
seemed like a horde of bloggers turned out to be just a few people in an echo
chamber.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Problems</h2>
<p>I don’t know how big a problem this will be for readers in general, but it
bothered me a lot that while Rob and Shel obviously worked together to build
the book, Shel wrote it.  Which means it totally isn’t in Rob’s
earnest high-velocity style, but rather a cool, neutral
tone with lots of commas and subordinate clauses.  I’m a big fan of Rob’s
writing but, given that this book is aimed at people who still need to be
convinced about blogging, maybe combining the medium and the message would
have been asking too much of the reader.  And to be fair, Scoble does have a
day job.</p> 
<p>I was also irritated by occasional lapses into Microsoft-party-line-ism,
for example: <i>Corporate customers have long understood that in enterprise
environments freeware is often expensive to use because of the problems it can
cause.</i>  It would be nice for Redmond if that were true.</p>
<p>Oh, and a quibble.  They say: <i>...in 1988 a couple of Stanford
kids came up with Google, which dramatically improved search results by
employing intelligent algorithms rather than simple keywords...</i>.  Oh,
please; all search has been based on dumb algorithms since day one, and so is
Google’s; their mojo is based on link-count-based relevance ranking, an idea
they were the first to apply, combined with a really user-friendly UI 
(i.e., less is more) and
outstanding operational skills (i.e. it’s fast and reliable).</p>
<p>Finally, I kind of wish that Rob and Shel had written a book, not about
business blogging, but about blogging’s wider cultural and societal impacts.
This is, at the end of the day, a good book about business blogging.
But
really, I think the most interesting parts of this great big complicated
global Naked Conversation have nothing to do with business.</p>

<title>On Intel</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I was reading the big <cite>Business Week</cite> story on Intel, and it
quoted CEO 
Paul Otellini: “He lays particular emphasis on marketing expertise because he
thinks the only way Intel can succeed in new markets is by communicating more
clearly what the technology can do for customers. ‘To sell technology now, you
have to do it in a way where it’s much more simple,’ says Otellini. ‘You can’t
talk about the bits and the bytes.’”  This seems deeply wrong to me on a whole
bunch of levels.  People already know what computers and game consoles and
telephones and all the other things with CPUs in them can do for them, and if
they 
don’t, it’s not Intel’s job to explain, that belongs to the people who build
the boxes that the consumers slap down their plastic for.   
Once the buyers understand, they care mostly about price, except for
bleeding-edge gamers and other CPU hogs, who perforce <em>do</em> care about
bits and bytes. Intel’s real
customers are Apple and Intel and Dell and HP and IBM, and I guarantee those
guys care about bits and bytes (and wattage), and even more about dollars per
unit.  So it looks to me like Intel’s charging off in the wrong direction with
Viiv and Core and so on.  Having said that, I suspect the Intel engineering
tribe is
maniacally focused on catching and beating AMD, and I wouldn’t want to bet
against them in the long term; so they’ll probably do OK.</p>

<title>Football, Beans, Sunshine, Sex</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>What happened was, we had some friends over for the Sunday football games,
and the day turned out very pleasantly in a bunch of ways; herewith an
illustrated narrative.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Football</h2>
<p>Oh my goodness gracious, that Indy-Steelers game was something.  It turned
out that our party was solidly packed with Pittsburgh fans and, despite the
wildly-randomized happenstances of the last five minutes, they won the game
fair and square.  For my money, the defining play was the Colts’
late fourth-down gamble; they knew the rush was coming and had to be prepared
for it and they still got slaughtered.  It looked to me like three
of them were blocking Polamalu; when Manning went down there were like five
white shirts around him.  If Indy can’t handle that Steelers defensive front,
who can?</p>
<p>Give the Steelers credit too for thinking; for coming out with an
all-aerial attack featuring repeated strikes to that eight-foot-tall rookie
tight end
whom I’d never heard of and whose name I’ve already forgotten.  
The Colts’ surprise lasted long enough to give Pittsburgh a  
fourteen-point head start, which turned out to be (barely) enough.</p>
<p>And like Roethlisberger said after the game, Bettis doesn’t fumble much and
he doesn’t tackle much, but that desperation ankle-grab won’t be forgotten
soon.  Jerome better send him flowers.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Beans</h2>
<p>I got up and started doing lunch prep sometime in the 
last quarter, but then had to put it on hold to catch the denouement.  Even so,
it was fine; to complement Lauren’s signature beef stew I tried
making Malaysian-style Sambhal green beans, and they came out great.  A little
bit of work: you chop ’em and boil ’em and dry ’em and stir-fry
’em at the last minute with some shallots and garlic, then glaze ’em with
oyster and fish and chili sauce plus a bit of cornstarch.  Mmm, spicy and
tasty.</p>
<img src="IMGP2879.jpg" alt="Spring sunshine magnolia-branch shadows" />
<h2 id='p-4'>Sunshine</h2>
<p>Our quest for the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/12/Rain">rain record</a> is still in
effect but the sun came out and stayed out during the game, so after lunch I
said “How about a walk” and we went for a lazy amble around the neighborhood.
On the way down the front walk I got this year’s first picture of our
much-photographed magnolia (above), just shadowbranches but there are lots of
buds.</p>
<p>Main Street in Vancouver is trying furiously to gentrify itself, but its
grubby history is pushing back; here’s a house a block off Main that I
bet is torn down in favor of chi-chi condos within five years.</p>
<img src="IMGP2883.jpg" alt="Old house near Main Street in Vancouver" />
<h2 id='p-6'>Sex</h2>
<p>Well, there are signs of Spring, and we all know what young men’s fancy
turns to thoughts of; and mine too.  Even given that, I thought this stump
remnant embedded in the grass was coming it a bit high; I suspect it’s due for
censorship before too long.</p>

<title>Open-Source Whatever</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Over at O’Reilly, John Mark Walker writes
<a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2006/01/12/no_oss_community.html?page=1">There
Is No Open Source Community</a>, and Nicholas Carr, who enjoys decrying, 
well, anything popular, chimes in with
<a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2006/01/the_amorality_o_1.php">The
Amorality of Open Source</a>.
They both paint a picture of misguided innocents who believe in some
starry-eyed vision of post-capitalist intellectual collectivism, but are
actually pawns in the hands of larger economic forces.
They’re both really wrong.  Granted: Open
Source is <em>not</em> 
a nation or a corporation or a political party or a religion.  (While there are
“movement people”, organized into the skeptical-of-each-other Open Source and
Free Software sects, they are a tiny—albeit noisy—minority.)
Absent those things, what is left?  A collection
of people who like working on software and look for opportunities,
preferably but not necessarily paid, to do so.
If that isn’t a “community”, what is?  And furthermore, I would recommend
that Walker and 
Carr spend some time hanging out in the IRC channels and pizza parties and
conferences and mailing lists and wikis where the Open-Source people actually,
you know, are.  
They would discover, now what’s the word I’m looking for...
people who actively seek out their own kind, who share jargon and jokes
and tools and thought leaders and enemies.
The word I’m looking for is “community”.
And anyone who thinks that this community would go away if Sun and IBM and
Novell and so on were to stop funding it is nuts.  Open Source
Software is its own reward; that, and hanging out with people who share our
passions. We don’ need no steenkin’ economics.  Or
ideologies either.</p>

<title>GPL3 Draft</title>
</head>

<p>The GNU Public License is an important piece of our 
infrastructure these days, so I read
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/webmink?entry=gpl_v3_released">Simon
Phipps’ report</a> with interest, and decided I should give the
<a href="http://gplv3.fsf.org/draft">V3 draft</a> a good close read.
Unfortunately, while the text may be sensible, the HTML is an unreadable
stinking heap of Plone dung; I attempted to print out a human-usable version
and the results were unprintable.
So I cleaned it up by hand, inserted a tiny bit of minimal styling to make it
a bit more human readable, made sure it was validated, and here it is:
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/gpl/gpl3-draft.html">GPL3 Draft of January

<title>Photo RSS, Sort Of</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Apple’s latest software bundle wraps RSS together with photo-publishing and
they call it “Photocasting”.  Reasonable enough.
<a href="http://scripting.wordpress.com/2006/01/11/welcome-to-the-wonderful-wacky-world-of-apple-rss/">Dave
Winer</a> and
<a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2006/01/17/apple-photocasting-mac-only-uses-invalid-rss/">Kevin
Yank</a> have pointed out that there are some real problems with the RSS.
So Mark Pilgrim did a deep-dive and it’s not just bad, it’s
<a href="http://lists.apple.com/archives/syndication-dev/2006/Jan/msg00020.html">spectacularly
bad</a>.  To quote Mark: <i>To sum up, the “photocasting” feature centers
around a single 
undocumented extension element in a namespace that doesn’t need to be
declared.  iPhoto 6 doesn’t understand the first thing about HTTP, the
first thing about XML, or the first thing about RSS.  It ignores
features of HTTP that Netscape 4 supported in 1996, and mis-implements
features of XML that Microsoft got right in 1997.  It ignores 95% of
RSS and Atom and gets most of the remaining 5% wrong.</i>
This is really hard to understand.
<i>[Update: The mob howling at Apple may have been a bit over-excited; check
out Sam Ruby’s
<a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/01/18/Photocasting-Hyperbole">careful
and balanced</a> look at the situation, including the follow-up comments.
And I apologize for leaping to
conclusions; those with painful knowledge of the history of syndication
politics will perhaps understand why, when the people listed at the top of this
entry are all saying the same thing, one might assume that it’s probably
true.]</i>

<title>Surprising the Eye</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>What happened was, I was speaking at a conference, sharing the stage
with the Chairman of the SEC (by video) and (in the flesh) the SEC’s CIO and
the FDIC’s Deputy CIO. No pointers because it deserves serious coverage.  For
the 
occasion, I (obviously) wore my best custom-made Italian suit (grey) and an
understated-but-strong tie (mostly blue), along with my dapper new
<a href="http://www.baileyhats.com/">Bailey’s</a> fedora.  
Then I took off for two heavy-geek
meetings at Sun campuses and a visit to Technorati.  When I pulled into the
Sun parking lot, I thought about pulling the tie off and the jeans on but
decided 
it would do ’em good to see a geek in a suit, and I have to say I got as
many blank-faced <em>WTF-is-this</em> looks as anyone could want.
But then, at the end of all my meetings, while I was trudging down a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_of_Market_%28San_Francisco%29">SoMa</a>
street to my 
alarmingly-huge Avis van ($20 in gas for a day going up &amp; down Route 101;
dear America, something’s wrong), I saw something really alarming.</p>
<img src="IMG_4317.jpg" alt="Puzzling evidence, SoMa in San Francisco" />

<p>Friday Slide Scan #19 is from around 1990 and is well-described by this
fragment’s title; it’s really very pretty.</p>
<img src="1034.jpg" alt="Feather and vase through sheer curtain" />
<p>I’m pretty sure that vase was picked up at a craft fair, something I
visited regularly in an earlier life, but now we have no room for more

<p>Images in the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1953

exactly who took one, I’ll say.

<body>
<p>People have been asking for it since forever, and recent releases of
<a href="http://www.rollerweblogger.org/">Roller</a> now have a group-blogging
feature.  I’ve always been skeptical of the idea, which redefines “blog”
from being 
about an individual voice to being about a shared interest; because people are
bigger and more interesting than their interests.  But over the last couple of
weeks, my attention has several times been drawn to pieces in
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/theaquarium">The Aquarium</a>, which
is a group blog about
<a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/glassfish/">GlassFish</a>. 
While I’m not really an EE kinda guy, I can see how someone who cares
about that stuff could find this kind of a resource useful.  For example,
check out
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/theaquarium?entry=publishing_a_restful_web_service">this
pointer</a> to an over-elaborated but nonetheless useful article about doing
REST in in JAX.

<title>WaPo Still Screwing Up</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The Washington Post has noticed the brewing storm over the two-tier
Internet;
<a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/">Doc Searls</a> gets the long-term credit for
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8673">starting the storm
brewing</a>.
The WaPo piece,
<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/21/AR2006012100094.html">The
Coming Tug of War Over the Internet</a>, is clueless, at a trivial level in
alleging that the debate is happening “on obscure blogs”, but most of all in
the outrageous claim that “Companies like Google and Yahoo pay some fees to
connect to their servers to the Internet, but AT&amp;T will collect little if any
additional revenue when Yahoo starts offering new features that take up lots
of bandwidth on the Internet. When Yahoo’s millions of customers download huge
blocks of video or play complex video games, AT&amp;T ends up carrying that
increased digital traffic without additional financial compensation.”
While the details of the deals by which the big boys buy bandwidth are
closely-guarded secrets, the notion that any of them can dramatically increase
their net traffic without paying for it, that notion is just wacko.
I’ve sent Christopher Stern, the author, an email, but this silliness is already
on the streets of Washington in a few hundred thousand dead-tree instances.
The difference between blogs and the mainstream media is that when we screw
up, we can mostly repair the damage.
<i>[Update: Five days later.  No answer to my polite, friendly email.  
No change in the article.  
So this “journalism” thing... it’s a profession where you can just
make random shit up and print it whether it’s right or wrong, and ignore

<title>5 ✭ ♫ Mondays</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The idea 
<a href="http://jwz.livejournal.com/578440.html">came from JWZ</a> 
in late 2005: why not rate all the music in your
jukebox?  If your jukebox is iTunes, you create an “unrated” smart-playlist
containing all the tunes with no stars, then you set up the Party Shuffle to
draw from it, then you rate them as they go by except when you’re not
listening, and after a few months, you have 
them all rated.  I haven’t got them all rated, but I have quite a few 
labeled ✭✭✭✭✭, which means “a tune that
in some way gives me as much pleasure as music can.”  
I care a lot about (and am reasonably literate about) music,
so I decided I to share some of this five-star stuff with the world.
I’ll try to post something most Mondays.
<i>[Does the title look broken?
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music#p-1">Here’s why
(Updated 2006/01/30).</a>]</i></p>
<img src="Five-Star-Mondays.png" class="inline" alt="How the title should look" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Title Broken?</h2>
<p>The title is supposed to look something like this picture.  It works fine
on all the Mac browsers I’ve tried and on recent Linuxes.  There aren’t any
graphics, the star and the music-notes are Unicode characters.
On Windows, if you’re using Internet Explorer you’re out of luck, it just
won’t work.  
On the other hand, if you’re using Firefox it’s less broken, and you can make
it work correctly (as Alastair wrote to point out), by installing 
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q287247/">Microsoft’s Arial Unicode
font</a>; more from Alastair
<a href="http://girtby.net/archives/2005/10/07/internet-explorer-makes-me/">here</a>.
For the moment I’m not going to fix it here, because it’s correct and I like
the way it looks.  Get a better browser.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Old, But Good</h2>
<p>A lot of the music I’ll describe is really old; as I progressed through
my forties I managed to outgrow my angst at not being hip and
up-to-the-minute in my tastes; I do manage to fall in love with the occasional
current hit, but no longer worry about a lot of my faves being from 
1977 or 1866 or 1755.  
Having said that, there are a few 21st-century cuts here, and I hope the
number grows. </p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Covering the Waterfront</h2>
<p>The music on my computer is a tiny and random
sliver of the music on my shelves, selected by impulse-grabbing random disks.
Plus there’s a selection of real obscurities dating from the golden
days of Napster — all of which I have in some other medium or would buy given
an opportunity.
So, the music has no common thread; but 
some songs come with stories.</p>
<p>My tastes are broad rather than deep; while I listen to more <em>kinds</em>
of music than anyone I know, I’m not an <em>authority</em> on Fifties
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_bop">hard-bop</a>
or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trip_hop">Bristol Trip-Hop</a> or the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Viennese_School">Vienna
School</a> or any of the others.
Except maybe for J.S. Bach, with whom I have a special relationship;
but this will <em>not</em> be all-classical; I will cover
most genres, excepting
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operetta">operetta</a> and 
hip-hop.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Try, Then Buy (On Disk, Please)</h2>
<p>So the idea is, most Mondays, to introduce some music that maybe you don’t
know about, and to avoid both wilful obscurity and greatest-hits pandering.
Many weeks I’ll recommend a single song, but I’ll also do aggregations
(albums, compositions, micro-genres) which have multiple 5-✭ members.</p>
<p>The following will sound like bragging, but: I’ve noticed over the years that
when I’ve told
someone “Listen to this, you’ll like it”, most times they do.
I’ll provide pointers to help track down online versions of the music for
sampling purposes.
If you like what you hear, please go buy it on an uncompressed,
un-rights-restricted Compact Disc, then it’ll be yours for the
long term.  
Good music deserves nothing less.</p>

<title>5✭♫: BWV 131</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I think I should start with 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.S._Bach">J.S. Bach</a>, since we
have a special relationship.
BWV 131 is one of his cantatas, based on
<i>Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir</i> (from
Psalm 130), composed in 1707,
and if you buy it you’ll like it.
<i>(“5✭♫” series introduction <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music">here</a>;
with <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music#p-1">an
explanation</a> of why the title may look broken.)</i></p>
<p>That “special relationship” is, first of all, just because I really like a
lot of 
Bach’s music, and second, because I was a student of the cello for some years,
and all cellists perforce get a lot of hands-on time with old Sebastian.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>BWV</h2>
<p>Some of Bach’s works have been lost but over a thousand remain, and 
the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BWV">BWV</a> numbers are used to
keep track of them.  
They are assigned thematically not chronologically; it so happens that the
cantatas come first in the sequence, BWV 1-224.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Context</h2>
<p>For much of his adult life, Bach’s employment
required him to provide music for each week’s divine worship, some
proportion of it being new on any given Sunday.  This usually took the form of
a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantata">cantata</a>, with a handful of
movements lasting less than a half-hour.
We citizens
of earth owe the eighteenth-century Lutheran church our thanks for
these onerous terms of employment, because
many of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cantatas_by_Johann_Sebastian_Bach">the 200
or so cantatas</a> written for this purpose are extremely good.</p>
<p>BWV 131 is among the earliest—maybe the earliest—of the known cantatas,
written while Bach was in his early twenties.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Music</h2>
<p>The melody is passed back and forth among the woodwinds, bass and tenor
soloists, and the choir.  I gave five stars to the middle three of the five
movements; each of which features a well-sung solo part with the choir’s lines
behind either rising slowly like an upwelling of joy, or drifting down like
ten thousand silver feathers through twilit air.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>How to Sample It</h2>
<p>It turns out that there’s an excellent
<a href="http://www.bach-cantatas.com/">Bach Cantatas Website</a>,
which I only discovered in researching this piece; it seems remarkably
complete.  The
<a href="http://www.bach-cantatas.com/BWV131.htm">coverage of BWV
131</a> includes 
<a href="http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Mus/BWV131-Mus.htm">downloadable
music</a>; the m4u didn’t work for me and the RealAudio is only 32k/sec,
hardly high fidelity, but you can get the idea.</p>
<img class="inline" src="Herreweghe-Kantaten.jpg" alt="J.S. Bach, Cantatas 131, 73, and 105, featuring Philippe Herreweghe and the Collegium Vocale of Ghent" />
<h2 id='p-5'>Getting It</h2>
<p>The Cantata site also lists a huge number of recordings; the one I have is 
from 1992, by Philippe Herreweghe and the Collegium Vocale of Ghent,
Virgin Classics 0 7777 59237 2 8; just now Amazon 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000DNWA/002-9351053-7203258?n=5174">says
it’s out of print</a> (while offering samples), but I totally recommend it if
you can find it; among other things, it includes 
<a href="http://www.bach-cantatas.com/BWV105.htm">BWV 105</a>, whose third
movement also got five stars.
Hmm, if they’re declining to sell the music, why shouldn’t I be able to post
it?
But I digress.
An Amazon search for “Herreweghe 131” yields a few other options.</p>
<p>Here’s the
great thing about Bach: his music is really hard to screw up.  Most of his
works are available in a bunch of different recordings, all selling well
because they’re good.  So if you visit your favourite shiny-disc emporium and
buy something that’s advertised as having BWV 131 on it, you’ll probably be
happy with what you take home.</p>

<title>Election Day</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I voted early this morning; we’ve been living in this neighborhood long
enough that 
I recognized some people over at the poll, hung out and chatted for a bit.
It felt good.
I think that what’s happening today here in Canada highlights the
single essential thing about democracy; I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/02/23/Democracy">wrote
about this almost three years ago</a>, but it’s worth saying again: I don’t
particularly trust “the people” to pick the right policies or even to pick the
right leaders.  I do, however trust them to detect the condition that the
government has been bad and needs to be turfed.  Which we, today, are
apparently the process of doing.  Frankly, I think it would be OK to pick the
next government by random selection, and we probably wouldn’t do that much
worse than the current electoral crap-shoot.  The important thing—<em>the only
thing that really matters</em>—is that we retain the right to throw ’em out in
a peaceful and orderly fashion, at our sole discretion and for any reason.
There are a lot of people in the world without that right.  It’s the one that
all the others flow from.</p>

<p>I ran across a couple of blog pointers to

of cool and kind of useful and kind of lightweight, and I wondered how it came
to be here this week when it wasn’t there last week.  So I chatted with Trung
Duc Tran (he’s one of the senior people over in our Prague NetBeans shop)
who put it together with a couple of other co-conspirators and asked
“How’d you do that?”  Well, it turns out that they found a cheap hosting
service and rented a fake

and cobbled together the

“It’s amazing”, Trung told me, “how much work you can get a servlet engine to
do when you have all the data in memory.”
I asked whether it was a lot of development time and he seemed surprised,
they’d discussed it over lunch one day last week and set it up over the

<p>Good news: Fatah (corrupt, incompetent, abusive) lost.
Good news: Clean election (amusing details 
<a href="http://a-mother-from-gaza.blogspot.com/2006/01/democratic-wedding.html">here</a>);
the losers are exiting gracefully, which is <em>huge</em>, 
Arabs in recent times have rarely enjoyed the privilege of peacefully
firing their rulers.
Now, as for the winners...
They don’t seem to have an English web site so anything we say about them is
on second-hand authority, but unless a
lot of reporters are lying, they’re more or less Wahhabi-style
beards-for-men veils-for-women fun-for-nobody Islamists, and
<a href="http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/hamas.htm">what
appears to be their manifesto</a> refers to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion">Protocols
of the Elders of Zion</a>,
demonstrating that they’re not just racists, they’re gullible racists.
Also, Hamas has engaged in terrorism.
Now, lots of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irgun">movements once regarded as terrorist</a> have ended up evolving into
respectable political parties, but it’s hard to imagine organized
religious fanaticism growing into the basis for a civilized
government.
Hamas’ win also means that maniacs like Netenyahu can claim that there’s
no point talking to Palestinians, but then he’d say that even if Mother Theresa
had just won the election.
In fact, the Israelis today saying “the peace process is
over” are, by and large, the ones who never wanted it to start.
On the other hand, as
<a href="http://takingalongview.blogspot.com/2006/01/wrong-but-real-guys.html">Br’er Rob</a>
points out, if you want peace you have to talk to your enemies, and yep, these
are <em>definitely</em> Israel’s real enemies.
The best possible outcome is that Hamas cleans up some of the corruption,
outgrows terrorism, and realizes that most of the Palestinians aren’t going to
go for the beards, veils, and so on.
The worst is what we’re more likely to get, the Middle East being what it is.

<title>FSS: The Rim</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Friday Slide Scan #20 has four samples from in 1985-86 in
<a href="http://www.pc.gc.ca/pn-np/bc/pacificrim/">Pacific Rim National
Park</a>.  These are pictures of the very Rim itself.</p>
<p>While I certainly haven’t seen all of B.C.’s famous sights, 
the Park stands out for a bunch of reasons among those I have.  
Obviously there is the
shocking beauty; then there is the scale (large), the vegetation, the ocean,
and the welcoming nearby towns when you want a break from all that nature.</p>
<p>The first two pictures are from August of 1985, taken from the park’s
“Schooner” campground; I must have twenty shots of the islet, here
pink-highlighted.  You can walk to it at low tide, but you can’t climb to the
top any time unless you’ve got thick clothing, determination, a machete, and
are willing to slaughter a lot of innocent vegetation.
I’ve never been.</p>
<img src="0568.jpg" alt="Pacific Rim National Park seascape" />
<img src="0572.jpg" alt="Pacific Rim National Park seascape" />
<p>The high summer of those first two pictures is pretty glorious out there on
the big beach, but the park comes into its own in winter, when the big Pacific
gales get their mojo workin’ and the vastness is mostly empty.  Mind you, the
days are short and the weather’s usually brutal, but you’ll see things that
you’ll never forget.</p>
<p>These two are from December 1986.</p>
<img src="0834.jpg" alt="Pacific Rim National Park seascape" />
<img src="0836.jpg" alt="Pacific Rim National Park seascape" />
<p>Images in the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1953
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>,

Bray, and
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>; when I know
exactly who took one, I’ll say; in this case, Tim and Cath Bray.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using

<title>5✭♫: Any Time</title>
</head>
<body>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Redbone">Leon Redbone</a> is 
alive and performing, but he’s not actually a <em>contemporary</em> artist; he
performs sentimental and jazz songs from the first half of the 20th century,
with acoustic accompaniment and period arrangements.
Which doesn’t sound very compelling; except for, Redbone picks terrific tunes
and sings them beautifully.
The song in question is the title track from his 2001 album
<a href="http://www.leonredbone.com/anytime.html">Any Time</a>, and it might
just be the single best vocal performance of our young century.
<i>(“5✭♫” series introduction <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music">here</a>;
with <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music#p-1">an
explanation</a> of why the title may look broken.)</i>
<i>[Update: Samples at the iTunes UK store.]</i></p>
<img class="inline" src="On-the-Track.png" alt="On the Track by Leon Redbone" />
<h2 id='p-1'>The Context</h2>
<p>Redbone’s real name is apparently Dickran Gobalian; he came slowly into
public consciousness in the early Seventies in the Toronto area; most people
had never heard of him until one day someone asked Bob Dylan who he’d be
interested in producing a record for, and he said Redbone was the only candidate.
Redbone used to perform at folk festivals with only a tuba for
accompaniment.</p>
<p>He is studiedly enigmatic, hiding behind the “Leon Redbone” construct and
having essentially never said anything about himself as a real actual person.
His in-concert patter is sparing and light-heartedly deranged; often limited,
between one forgotten 1920’s tune and the next, to a growled “Here’s that
big, big hit...” He also plays some remarkable acoustic guitar breaks.</p>
<p>His first record, <cite>On the Track</cite>, made a lot of people very
happy twenty years ago; in particular I think he totally owns
Fats Waller’s <cite>Ain’t Misbehaving</cite>.  Plus the album cover was beyond cool.</p>
<img class="inline" src="Any-Time.png" alt="Any Time by Leon Redbone" />
<h2 id='p-2'>The Music</h2>
<p><cite>Any Time</cite> is a typical Redbone selection, an uptempo love
song, penned in 1921 by one Herbert 
“Happy” Lawson, who seems hardly to exist on the Internet except on a thousand
sites offering guitar tablatures.</p>
<p>I think this performance might be Redbone’s best ever.
It’s unironic yet positively gleeful; he sends his
voice, at once rich and sinuous, loping, bending and bouncing through
the verses, throwing in a hiccup here, a break into falsetto there, and in the
last verse teetering gracefully on the edge of a yodel.
As you listen you find yourself thinking “gosh, that’s a sweet sentiment” and
“mmm, what a great tune”, maybe snickering at the trombone.
A couple of careful listens later it might dawn on you
that this is a totally virtuoso vocal (I’m not sure any
other living singer could manage some of those twists); which is as it should
be, the technique lifting the music while hiding behind it.</p>
<p>The arrangement is at the blues end of Dixieland, with barrel-house piano
and some outrageous trombone portamento, sprightly and unobtrusive.  
The whole thing is 
essentially perfect.  There are twelve tunes on the record, none weak, with
six four-star performances to accompany this gem.
The composers’ names alone leave a rich flavor in the mind: Herbert Happy
Lawson, Jelly Roll Morton, Spencer &amp; Clarence Williams, Nacio Herb Brown,
FJ Coots Haven, Mitchell Parrish, Arthur Sizemore, Egbert Van Alstyne.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>How to Sample It</h2>
<p>This is not exactly all over the net; I poked around in pirate territory
and briefly saw a 42M MP3 of the whole album on Gnutella.  
iTunes doesn’t seem to have it.
<i>[Update: Richard Newman writes to say that the Any Time tracks are there on
the UK iTunes music store.]</i>  There are samples
on Amazon, but navigating straight to the album doesn’t turn them up, you have
to search for “Leon Redbone Any Time”, then the first
“[Import]” match has them.
Amazon’s price, when I checked on the weekend, seemed like a real bargain to me.</p>
<p>You might think you don’t need straight unironic performances of
lightweight eighty-year-old pop ditties in your record collection, but you’d
be wrong; this is pure gold.</p>

<title>Music Sharing</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The mornings when I take the kid to school I see them standing in the
schoolyard, sharing two between four or three between five.  
It’s a primary school, 
which around here means K-7, and I’m talking about the Grade 7 girls
and their iPods.  Two can share a listen, an earbud for each 
and two ears left open for talk, but mostly they don’t, they just listen, maybe
bopping a little but mostly not.  
I wonder what they’re listening to?
I’m seeing more of them now in the new year
than I did back at the start of school, I wonder if the iPod-per-girl density
reached a tipping point at Christmas.
<i>[Update: What they’re listening to.]</i></p>
<p>A friend wrote me with an educated opinion as to what they’re listening
to; I suggested that he blog it and he replied “Thanks, Tim.  Unfortunately,
my older daughter knows how to use search 
engines, and I don't think I could survive the bombardment of sarcasm
that would hit me if I blogged about her musical preferences.”
So I thought I’d quote him anonymously.</p>
<blockquote><p>Watch
<a href="http://www.muchmusic.com/">Much Music</a> for an hour and you'll have
a pretty good idea: the 
grade-seven girls are Much’s target audience, and they listen to the
same thing they watched.  Based on my experience with my daughters and
their friends downtown in another large Canadian city, the mainstream
grade-7 girls will be listening to a lot of Green Day and Eminem, just
like the boys are (and maybe Sum 41, Blink 182, Good Charlotte, and
similar).  The socially-challenged girls will be listening to Hilary
Duff or Lindsay Lohan but most will have outgrown them by grade 7. 
The singing/dancing types will be listening to Kelly Clarkson and
various other pop divas whose names elude me right now.  A few will be
into rap, but that’s more of a boy thing.  Girls with older siblings
might be a few years ahead of the game, following their siblings’
tastes; first borns might be a little behind, trying to catch up with
their friends.</p>
<p>By grade 8, a lot of that seems to be falling apart.  The cooler girls
start moving retro, abandoning Much music and discovering old acts
like the Ramones, Nirvana, Led Zep, etc., depending on their tastes;
others start looking for more independent contemporary acts that don’t
make Much’s high rotation playlist.  Anyone still listening to Hilary
Duff at this point will be keeping it a closely-guarded secret to
avoid total social annihilation.</p>

<title>Protecting Your Data</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I was watching a mailing-list discussion of backup software,
and how often you should back up, and based on some decades’ experience,
found some of the thinking sloppy.
Here are my life lessons on keeping your data safe while assuming that The Worst Will Happen.
Some of it is Macintosh-specific, but there may be useful
take-aways even from those parts, even for non-Mac-hacks.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Catastrophe</h2>
<p>It’s been said that the eventual failure rate for hard-disk drives is
100%. This is a little misleading; I haven’t had an actual disk crash on any
of my computers in at least a decade.  But it can happen and it does happen
and you should think about it.</p>
<p>And crashes aren’t the only way to lose data.
The single greatest threat to my data is <em>me</em>.  During the course of
day, I touch lots of data, and each touch is a chance to screw
up, and sometimes I do screw up, and sometimes data is lost.
I suspect this may be true of you, too.</p>
<p>I can remember, back when I was a sysadmin, seeing the occasional 
newsgroup post, the kind of
thing that makes you feel sick to read: “One of our users is suicidal
because he had three years’ worth of data for his Ph.D. dissertation on an
un-backed-up drive and it’s gone south.  Can anyone think of anything?”
Usually, no-one could, and it didn’t matter whether the problem was hardware
failure or user error.</p>
<p>If I catastrophically lost
everything that’s on my laptop, it would blast a major hole in the integrity
of my life.
I’d rather not even think about it.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>How I Do It</h2>
<p>I back up once a month or so, occasionally missing a month, and I use
“tar”, a decades-old Unix command line utility.
But I sleep easy at night. I’m quite confident that my data is really very
safe; it’s been years since I lost anything I cared about.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>The Rules</h2>
<p>If you follow these, you almost certainly won’t lose data in any damaging way.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Don’t use proprietary file formats.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t erase anything.</p></li>
<li><p>Store everything twice.</p></li>
<li><p>Do occasional ad-hoc and regular full backups.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these are not rules for professionally-managed data centers, who
have incredibly complicated backup requirements and often live in a regulated
environment.  If you’re a pro, the only way to be safe is to hire an expert
and throw some real money at the problem.</p>
<p>This advice is aimed at the users of <em>personal</em> computers, whose
needs are simpler and less variable.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>No Proprietary Formats</h2>
<p>This is actually a two-part rule.  First, don’t store the actual live data
you care about in proprietary file formats.  Second, don’t use them for your
backups either.</p>
<p>The live-data part is easy to understand.  Don’t store your Last Will and
Testament in a <code>.doc</code> file, or your priceless collection of
Delta Blues recordings in Apple-only or
Windows-only formats, or your wedding photos as a Corel Paint Shop Pro 
<code>.psp</code>.</p>
<p>It’s easy to be safe.  For important documents, keep PDF or HTML versions
around. 
For pictures, use JPG or PNG, and for audio use MP3 for compressed data and
WAV or equivalent for high-quality stuff.</p>
<p>And yes, this is another reason why things like the Open Document Format
are very, very important; increasingly so every year as our personal lives
become embodied in bits.</p>
<p>The proprietary-backup-format issue is a little subtler; let me try to
bring it alive:</p>
<h3 id='p-5'>Horror Story</h3>
<p>Back sometime in the Nineties, I bought a new computer and for some
reason that I now forget, was running Windows NT 4 on it.
Since I’m serious about data protection, I bought it with a little cartridge
tape drive, DAT format I think, and saved everything once a week or so, using
the procedure in the Windows user guide.</p>
<p>Sure enough, a few months in, I accidentally nuked something important.
Feeling smug, I slapped in the most recent tape and invoked the magic
data-restore procedure.
The computer silently ground away on the tape-drive for about twenty minutes
and then said “Invalid save-set; exiting.”  
I spent some unsatisfactory time with Microsoft phone support, who asked a lot
of questions and then said (more or less) “Invalid save-set; exiting.”
I have rarely been angrier.</p>
<p>I managed to dig up a Unix box with the right drive that would actually let
me read the raw data, but that didn’t help; it was ungodly mashed-up
broken-as-designed spaghetti data with binary numbers splashed all over it;
the real miracle is that it could ever have worked for anyone.</p>
<p>So when I hear the Macintosh experts talking about all those commercial
backup utilities with their cute names, I tend to think they’re mostly nuts.
Among other things, suppose I want to restore the data on a computer that’s
not a Macintosh?  It’s <em>my data</em>, after all.</p>
<p>So: Do not, whatever you do, feed your valuable data to a program that is
going to save it in a file format that can only be read by that program, or by
that kind of computer.  Because when the program can’t or the computer can’t,
<em>you’re out of options</em>.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>Don’t Erase Anything</h2>
<p>I’ve noticed that this basic idea is really hard for people to warm up to,
but trust me, it’s a good one.  Here are a couple of war stories.</p>
<p>Back in 1991 or so, my then-employer 
<a href="http://www.opentext.com/">Open Text</a> sold a search-and-display
system to
<a href="http://www.ringier.ch/">Ringier</a>, a Swiss newspaper/magazine
publisher.  At the time of the deal, they were generating about one megabyte
of data per day; so a year’s worth was a substantial chunk of data given the
disk sizes back then.
We were having one of our planning meetings and their IT manager said “And now
we have to design the schedule for deleting the old data.”  I had an epiphany
right there in the room and said “Why would you ever do that?”  He looked at
me like I was crazy, but we walked through the economics; the cost of keeping
a year’s data was, in the big picture, negligable.</p>
<p>Skip forward 14 years: Last summer, when I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/08/27/New-Mac-for-Mom">got Mom her new
computer</a>, and we were transferring everything over to it, she said “Now
I’ll have to go through everything and decide what to throw out.”  All of a
sudden there were echoes from that smokey room in Zürich in 1991: “Why would
you want to do that?”</p>
<p>Here’s the deal: every time you erase something, <em>you might be making a
mistake</em>.  This is the most common way data gets lost.
So, don’t do that.  If things are getting in your way, make a
folder called “Dusty old files” or whatever, and put them in there.  Then
forget about them.  One day you’ll want something from four years ago and
you’ll be happy.  Even if you don’t, you’re much less likely to accidentally
lose those wonderful baby-shower pictures.</p>
<p>The cost of disk space these days is just so ridiculously low that most
people never manage to fill up their laptops.  So why on earth
would you invest your precious time in a dangerous activity (deleting things)
in order to conserve a resource that’s essentially free?</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Store Everything Twice</h2>
<p>Hard disks fail, but not very often.  Optical disks (CD/DVD-ROMs) fail too,
but also not very often.  If you have your data on two disks, not plugged into
the same computer, both of them would have to fail at the same time to lose
your data, which
happens not-very-often-squared; you’re
more likely to get hit by a falling safe or win millions in the
lottery.</p>
<p>Let me make this very personal.  On my laptop, the data that I really care
about is: email, pictures, music, blog entries, source
code, and conference presentations.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>My email is on my laptop but also on a server somewhere in the bowels of
Sun.</p></li>
<li><p>Pictures (which I keep as JPGs in ordinary folders, one folder per
month)
get copied over to the family fileserver, a big little-used Windows box in the
basement, every few days.</p></li>
<li><p>Music is all copied off of disks I own, except for the rarities I
snagged from 
Napster back in the day, which I have a copy of on the fileserver.</p></li>
<li><p>My blog entries are all here, and also up on
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/">tbray.org</a> as of the instant they’re
published.</p></li>
<li><p>Program code gets synced up regularly with some source-code repository or
another; and the one thing that will motivate me to do frequent backups is when
I’m coding but unable, for a few days, to check the code in.</p></li>
<li><p>That leaves conference speeches, and I only write one or two of those a
month, and they’re not all new material; I might lose one or two in a
between-backups crash.  But when I finish writing one and head off for the
conference, I always dump the presentation onto one of those little USB disks
and carry it along in my pocket; which has saved me more than once.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Keeping multiple copies is the <em>single most powerful tool</em> I know of
to protect your data.</p>
<h2 id='p-8'>Do Ad-Hoc Backups</h2>
<p>Suppose you’ve just finished some project: editing the pictures from a
trip, or writing a conference presentation, or crunching some numbers.
While you’re still feeling that warm glow of achievement, slap a
CD-ROM or DVD-ROM in the computer and save it.  
Then get one of those Sharpie markers and write right there on the disk what’s
on it.
Then put
the disk on a shelf somewhere and chances are you’ll never touch it again.</p>
<p>It won’t take long, and you’ll sleep better, and it might just save your
butt.</p>
<h2 id='p-8'>Do Full Backups</h2>
<p>There’s a very old, very bad idea that comes to us from computing’s dim
dark past, and it’s called “The incremental backup”.  Time was, you had 500-meg
disks, but you backed up on tape (remember those spinning tape reels that
computers used to have in old movies?) which were only 110 meg if I recall
correctly.  
So you had this elaborate software that you ran every day that would go
through the disk and just save onto the tape the stuff that had changed that
day.
Then, once a week or so, you’d back up the whole disk onto a box-full of
tapes.
In those days, computer departments had to have lots of space for big racks
full of tape reels that held your backups.
Imagine how complicated and elaborate it was figuring out how to restore just
the right version from an incremental-backup set.  
It was worse than you imagined, a
frequent source of error and further data destruction.</p>
<p>If you’re already storing everything twice, as I advised above, it’s still
a good idea to do a massive backup of everything now and again, if only for
convenience.  If you’re updating anything daily and you care about it, you
should bloody well find a way to store it twice (see examples above), and
there’s usually a better way than an incremental backup.</p>
<p>So I recommend, when you do a backup, you include everything you own, without
exception; don’t try to be smart.
This minimizes the possibility that you’ve left out something that you’re not
smart enough to think of now.</p>
<p>There’s another recommendation that falls out of this: try to keep
everything you care about under one folder, so it’s easy to back up.  
Mac OS X makes this really
easy, by default storing everything you create somewhere under your home
folder.  There is lots of Windows software that still squirrels important
stuff away in a place that’s not your home directory; just another
penalty for using a second-rate operating system.</p>
<h2 id='p-9'>How I Back Up</h2>
<p>I’ve already described ad-hoc backups; I do lots of those.</p>
<p>Which brings us to regular full backups, and, I’m afraid, a kind of
unsatisfactory ending to this essay.  I had started writing a detailed
blow-by-blow narrative of exactly how I do this, but started to get this
nightmare scenario in my head where some non-Unix-geek tries to apply it and
puts in back-quotes for quotes or something like that and silently destroys her
data.</p>
<p>I will reproduce the two exact command lines I used
on my most recent backup and restore, with commentary for Unix geeks, but
<strong>DON’T EVEN THINK OF TRYING TO USE THIS</strong> unless you really know
what you’re doing, because <strong>YOU WILL PROBABLY LOSE YOUR PRECIOUS
DATA</strong>.</p>
<p>I’ll also appeal to the LazyWeb: if anyone cares to recommend tools or
utilities that achieve the desired effect and are safe for use by real
non-geek people, let me know and I’ll point to them here.</p>
<p>Having said that, here are two specific piece of advice:</p>
<h3 id='p-12'>Do Video Separately</h3>
<p>Video files are so bloody huge that there’s no point trying to pretend
they’re like ordinary data.  When I finish a piece of video I save it onto a
DVD all of its own, and leave it out of my regular backups.  I keep video in a
separate folder, not my home folder, so that this will work.</p>
<h3 id='p-10'>Buy An External Disk Drive</h3>
<p>You can get these in any computer store, they’re called “FireWire” or “USB
2” drives.  They’re real easy to use, you just plug ’em in and there they
are.  They come as small as 40G or so, the cost-per-byte goes down as they get
bigger, so you might as well buy a big one.</p>
<p>In my case, I’m using a 250G disk and my whole life,
compressed, is about 26G, so this one will last most but not all of a year
before it’s full.
Then I’ll go buy another.  I already 
have two sitting at the back of a shelf somewhere.  The costs are acceptable.
Most people’s requirements will be much less extreme.</p>
<h2 id='p-13'>For Unixians: Doing It With ‘tar’</h2>
<p>This old, simple, reliable technology and has a lot of advantages, but...</p>
<p><strong>THE FOLLOWING IS FOR UNIX GEEKS ONLY.  DO NOT TRY TO DO THIS UNLESS
YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT’S GOING ON OR YOU WILL LOSE YOUR DATA.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve labeled the current FireWire drive
“2005-05” to remind me when I bought it.  I created my most recent save-set
like so:</p>
<pre><code>cd
cd ..
tar czf /Volumes/2005-05/archive/2006-01-28.tgz twbray</code></pre>
<p>Recently, I stupidly overwrite a file named “Sigrid.sxw” with something
completely different.  Sigh.  Here’s how I recovered, after plugging in the
FireWire drive:</p>
<pre><code>cd
cd ..
tar xzvf /Volumes/2005-05/archive/2005-12-03.tgz twbray/sun/Sun2005/08/Sigrid.sxw</code></pre>
<p>Some notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The tar archives are readable on Windows (via cygwin) and Linux; I’ve
checked.</p></li>
<li><p>Some may object that tar will bypass resource forks and other HFS
voodoo.  Well, fuck that; 
if I have any data that relies on resource forks to work, then I’m a
sharecropper on Steve’s plantation, and serve me right if I lose it.</p></li>
<li><p>It takes a long time. Start the process, go to bed, and sleep soundly
in the knowledge that your data is safe.</p></li>
</ul>

At a conference in London, Microsoft’s

helpfully
<a href="http://dooooooom.blogspot.com/2006/01/drm-go-go.html">explained</a>
the goals of their DRM strategy: “We don’t want this technology to be available to every hobbyist. We need to keep the number of licensees down to a manageable number. We charge a license fee to keep the number of people we have to deal with down to a level we can handle.”
Now, there’s a damn fine way to build a nice, disciplined business.
Wouldn’t want any of those nasty entrepreneurs stirring things up, would we?

<title>LAMP and Java</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Take a minute and read Stephen O’Grady’s
<a href="http://www.redmonk.com/sogrady/archives/001251.html">write-up</a>,
which starts at the Sun Analyst Conference, but says a bunch of things about
Java and LAMP and related subjects.
I’ve been thinking about this stuff almost all the time for the past year or
so, so let’s take his ideas a bit further.</p>
<p>Stephen talks about “scripting communities”, but I suspect he wouldn’t
object to me widening the focus a bit to LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL,
Perl/Python/PHP), because that’s where a <em>lot</em> of the scripting-language
action is.</p>
<p>And before I say anything more, please review that little squib over to
your right; I work for Sun and I have lots of opinions, but I do <em>not</em>
speak for the company on this.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>LAMP</h2>
<p>The text you are now reading, and the Web site it lives on, are the product
of
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Colophon">a pure LAMP software suite</a>.
Java was never really a candidate, even though I’m reasonably expert
with it and use it for other kinds of things.  
No ifs, ands, or buts; LAMP was a better choice
for me for a quick-personal-blogging-system project.  
First, I work faster in Perl than Java and I
got it done quick; coming up on my third anniversary, the total programming
time is still just a couple of weeks.  Second, the results are good; the way
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> looks and works suits me.  Third, the
performance is excellent; the site can soak up a slashdotting without
breathing hard.</p>
<p>So one way or another, there’s gonna be a lot of LAMP out there.
Because people think they can get it done quicker, or because they know those
P-languages better, or because they’re in love with Ruby, or because there’s
some library they want to use that only PHP has, or, well, who cares, there
are a lot of reasons.
Nothing we at Sun can say will change this, nor should we want to.</p>
<p>(Obviously, there will also be a ton of Java-based development going on,
because there are lots of jobs where Java is the right answer, but that’s not
what we’re talking about here.)</p>
<p>Since we’re a computer company, it’s a no-brainer that we ought to make our
computers a friendly home for LAMP.
Actually, I think we already do; I take my particularly-piggish perl &amp;
python scripts and whenever I can, I run ’em on my
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/10/18/New-Computer">Ultra 20</a> on Solaris,
because that combo smokes anything else I can get my hands on.
After all, every single one of those dynamic languages has a runtime that’s
just a great big honkin’ C program, and Unix is pretty good at that.
But there is a problem:
While there are a zillion industry benchmarks to measure your
Java performance, I don’t know of any standardized way to characterize
performance on typical LAMP apps.</p>
<p>So yeah, Stephen’s got a point, we ought to be a bit more proactive about
figuring out how to characterize LAMP performance, and making it obvious that
we’re good at that game and happy to be in it.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>LAMP/J</h2>
<p>Stephen pointed out correctly that more and more of us here at Sun are
talking about Jython and JRuby and Caucho (as in, 
<a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=38144">PHP on the JVM</a>) and so on.
But Stephen points out “There are a great many dynamic language developers who
either won’t or can’t run a JVM, so a Jython or a JRuby that will run on top
of one is not of interest”. </p>
<p>Stephen, let me turn that around.  It turns out that most software
developers spend most of their time, not building new green-field projects,
but enhancing or extending or fixing existing apps.  And most of those apps
are on the JVM.  And I think they could be more productive if they could work
in Ruby or Python at least some of the time.</p>
<p>But they absolutely can’t or won’t <em>not</em> run a JVM, because that’s
where their apps are.  So to make their lives better, we should make sure that
the right tools are there for them.</p>
<p>There’s another reason, too.  The next big wave of server CPUs (starting
with our own Niagara) are going to be increasingly
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/Concurrency/">multithreaded and
concurrent</a>.  There’s no choice, we can’t just go on turning up the clock
rate, so if you want more performance, parallelism is the way to get it.</p>
<p>At the moment, the threading in Perl and Python and Ruby and PHP tends to
be amateurish-to-absent.  Java’s threading/concurrency machinery, on the other
hand, has been excellent for years, and got a lot better in the 1.5 release.
The dynamic-language guys will be working on this, but they’re starting
from way behind.</p>
<p>So there’s potentially a big performance boost
to be had in bringing at least some dynamic-language apps on board the Java
platform.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>What Should Sun Do?</h2>
<p>A large part of the problem is simply the message.  For years, the
perception has been that the Java platform looks like this:</p>
<img src="Java-Platform-1.png" alt="The Original Java Platform" />
<p>I’d like us to end up with something that looks more like this:</p>
<img src="Java-Platform-2.png" alt="The Future of the Java Platform" />
<p>You still
have all those APIs, you still have that nice fast threaded JVM, but you can
work in whatever language you want to.</p>
<p>So the first thing we have to do is to stop mixing up the Java Language and
the Java Platform, and make it clear to the world that other languages—in
particular dynamic languages—work fine on the platform, and that
there’s nothing wrong with using them.</p>
<p>Then we have to do some engineering work to help this happen.
The good news is, we’re getting started on that; see Gilad Bracha’s
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/gbracha?entry=invokedynamic">article</a>
and 
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/resources/gbracha/JAOO2005.pdf">slides</a> 
on the JVM-level progress.
But that’s way down in the engine room; I think we need to help out all the
way up and down the stack; the profilers and debuggers and IDEs and, well
everything.</p>
<p>But still (call me a marketing droid if you want to) I think the
message is the important thing:
It’s time to grow and share the Java platform; everybody wins.</p>

<body>
<p>There are a few feeds I subscribe to that I almost never read; they’re just
there for when I’m stuck on a boring con call or I’m really tired late at
night.  One of them is
<a href="http://www.nkzone.org/nkzone/">North Korea Zone</a>; 
I have a sick fascination with North Korea, the fact such a place can still
exist in the 21st Century is mind-boggling.  Anyhow, late last night I ran
across some online North Korean Art, which I entirely lack words to describe.
To get warmed up, check out these
<a href="http://northkorea-art.com/socialistrealism/filmposters.html">Film
Posters</a>.  Then there are shots of Kim Il-Sung
<a href="http://www.dprkstudies.org/documents/nkpics/1pg118.html">with
children</a> and
<a href="http://www.dprkstudies.org/documents/nkpics/1pg042.html">burning
books and documents</a>.  Finally, I’m not sure why this one of
<a href="http://www.dprkstudies.org/documents/nkpics/2pg041b.html">Kim
Jeong-Sook</a> (whom I assume is the same person as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-suk">Kim Jong-Suk</a>) appealed
to me, but it did.

<p>I went and got that second alpha release of 
<a href="http://www.nexenta.com/">Nexenta</a> from
<a href="http://www.gnusolaris.org/">gnusolaris.org</a> and gave it a try on
my
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/10/18/New-Computer">Ultra
20</a>. 
There are still a few rough edges, but it basically works.
<i>[Updates: Managed to try NetBeans, and filed
<a href="http://www.gnusolaris.org/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/ticket/207">my first bug</a>.]</i></p>
<p>There’s a curses-flavor installer, and quickly I hit my first problem; I
couldn’t figure out how to make it use my existing partition table and install
over my previous vanilla Solaris.
Well, I figured, I won’t need that Ubuntu on the other partition any more
after I install this 
(right?) so I told Nexenta to take the whole disk and let ’er rip.</p>
<p>The installation was pretty trouble-free, except it didn’t ask me to set
the time, which caused a few problems later when I switched it from European
to West Coast time.</p>
<p>Did I say rough edges?  If you hit an invalid key while you’re working
through the install menus, a little error message appears in the corner of the
screen saying “Wuff Wuff!”.  OK, then.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Smells Like Linux</h2>
<p>Anyhow, once you’ve got through the install, it starts to feel remarkably
like Debian in general and Ubuntu in particular.
One downside: it actually creates a root account that you can <code>su</code>
into; both OS X and Ubuntu hide that account and make you use
<code>sudo</code>, which is really much better.</p>
<p>The Synaptic package manager seems to Just Work, and there sure are lots
of packages there.  I installed the Gimp, and you know, my Mac laptop totally
Just Can’t Do This (check the pixel sizes on those slide scans):</p>
<img src="Screenshot.png" alt="Nexenta Gimp screenshot" />
<h2 id='p-2'>Step-by-Step Java</h2>
<p>What I want to run, of course, is NetBeans.
Except for, despite what the Nexenta announcement says, there’s no Java there, 
and I couldn’t find one in Synaptic.
I shot off an email to Nexenta guy Alex Ross (his address isn’t hard to find)
and he wrote back “Oops, that’s a
<a href="http://www.gnusolaris.org/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/ticket/202">bug</a>, just do <nobr><code>apt-get install
sunwjre1.5</code></nobr>.” 
Of course I hadn’t found that package because I’d been looking for things that
began with J.</p>
<p>So now that I had a JRE, I went and got the NetBeans 5.0 download, but it
whined that it needed a JDK.  Grmph.  And there was no
<code>sunwjdk1.5</code> package to be seen in Synaptic.</p>
<p>“Alex?”</p>
<p>“Oops.  Hold on... right.  Now you can <nobr><code>apt-get
sunwjdk1.5</code></nobr>.”</p>
<p>Then the NetBeans installation worked fine—boy, does it ever start up fast!
Now I have to figure out how to get into Sun’s VPN so I can actually check out
some code and use it.</p>
<p><i>[Update]</i> I ran out of patience fighting with VPN and just copied all
my source code over.  I’ve written about this before, but if you’re using a
modern IDE (I suspect this is true for Eclipse, IntelliJ, and Visual Studio
too) and you’re not throwing some big iron at the problem, go get yourself a
new computer.  I really like recompiles of ten thousand lines or so of code
with zero seconds elapsed.  <em>Really</em> like it.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Future</h2>
<p>In the future, when you get yourself an x86 or x64 box, you’re going to
face a series of choices, including two big ones: KDE or Gnome for the UI?
Linux or Solaris for the kernel?  It looks like the same software is going to
pretty well just work, whichever choices you make.  So your choices are going
to be based on your tastes and your application mix and what kind of support
you want and so on.  Which are <em>all business issues.</em>  As in, no
lock-in.  This is a New Thing in the world.</p>

<p>It’s been a couple of months since I’ve hit the WS-punching-bag, but one
can hardly ignore it when WS-jargon creeps into the cynical geek’s
holy of holies; that’s right, I’m talking about
<a href="http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/archive/dilbert-20060204.html">Dilbert</a>.
In other recent news, last week SDForum put on an Interoperability Workshop,
nicely written up by 
<a href="http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/index.php/id;1982139180;fp;512;fpid;40%200449000">Paul
Krill</a> and
<a href="http://www.xmlgrrl.com/blog/archives/2006/02/03/sdforum-event-notes/">Eve
Maler</a>.  
There were some terrific sound-bites: “I understand what all
this stuff is and it still makes my head spin”; “The vendors are always
pursuing their own agenda” (I’m shocked, <em>shocked</em>);
“You really do need to be a rocket scientist to use a lot of it”; and “The
thing we have to be a little careful about is that we need abstractions that
don’t assume that you can cover up complexity with tooling”.
But you know what, maybe Dilbert really is more indicative; when you have
startup company, you know you’re in trouble when Dilbert cartoons start
showing up on cubicle walls.
Let’s see, in this corner we have Gartner saying that if you’re not doing
WS-strategic-synergies (as in WS-big-budget), you’re In The Wrong Quadrant.
In the other corner, we have Dilbert.  I know who I’d bet on.</p>

<title>Crocuses!</title>

<body>
<p>Regular readers have been putting up with quite a bit of whining about the
endless weeks of solid rain.  Well, that seems to have
<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2006/02/05/bc-windstorm060205.html?ref=rss">blown
itself out with a bang</a>, and the sun rose this Sunday morning.
It turns out that all that rainy weather was also kind of warm, and the first
flowers were more than ready to show their faces.</p>
<p>The crocuses lurk slim and closed until the sun hits them; the first of
these three shots was within ten minutes of the sun reaching this clump, the
second and third at intervals of half an hour or so.</p>

<title>Emersonapalooza</title>

<body>
<p>Oh my goodness gracious.
We had an election here in Canada last month, and the
Conservatives (“Tories” for short) 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_federal_election%2C_2006">threw out the Liberals</a>, to the general satisfaction
of an irritated populace, but failed to get a majority in Parliament, to the
general satisfaction of a cautious populace.
My own riding,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Kingsway">Vancouver
Kingsway</a>, had been held by Liberal 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Emerson">David Emerson</a>, a
seasoned private and public sector executive who’d been parachuted in but won
it fair and square, and has always been in the cabinet; he held the seat for
the Liberals last month.
This morning, we awoke to the news that he’d “crossed the floor”, joined the
Tories, and been rewarded with a senior Cabinet post.
This change subtly shifts the combinatorics of power in parliament and will be
very useful to the government.
The country in general and my neighborhood in particular is pretty
flabbergasted.
I got my jollies when I picked up my morning coffee and some TV news crew
was waiting outside asking passers-by what they thought.  I spluttered,
telegenically I hope, if they run it and anyone sees it, let me know.
Canadians in search of some political snickers and a historic but imperilled
document can read on for more.

<p>Andrew Coyne
<a href="http://andrewcoyne.com/2006/02/harpers-worst-enemy.php">has some
fun</a> with the event, too.</p>
<p>Here’s my little contribution: below is the front page at
<a href="http://kanmanwong.com/">KanmanWong.com</a>; Kanman Wong was the
actual candidate that the Tories actually ran in the riding, you know,
the one the people could have voted for if they’d wanted to be represented by
a Conservative?  And he wasn’t a bad candidate either, had a successful
business career, obviously a smart guy, an education activist, an immigrant
who’s made good, really a plausible potential Member of Parliament.</p>
<p>I kinda suspect this web site will be taken down before too long, so I
snagged a copy.</p>
<img src="Conservative-Kanman-Wong.jpg" alt="Kanman Wong, Conservative candidate for Vancouver Kingsway in 2006" />
<p>He ran third, 11,383 votes behind Emerson (out of 46,442 cast).</p>
<p>Parliamentary democracy; really unmatched in its opportunities for duplicity.</p>

<title>5✭♫: Burning Farm</title>
</head>
<body>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shonen_Knife">Shonen Knife</a> formed
in Osaka in the early Eighties and, a decade later, suddenly had a North
American audience; it helped that they opened for Nirvana on a 1993 tour.
<cite>Burning Farm</cite> was the title of their first record but also of a
song; the version I have is off of 1993’s <cite>Let’s Knife</cite>, probably
the group’s 
essential album.  It has a lot of good songs with great melodies,
superb light-hearted vocals, high-energy performances, punk guitar, and
amiable Japanese looniness; but <cite>Burning Farm</cite> stands out.
<i>(“5✭♫” series introduction <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music">here</a>;
with <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music#p-1">an
explanation</a> of why the title may look broken.)</i></p>
<img src="Lets-Knife.png" class="inline" alt="Let's Knife by Shonen Knife" />
<h2 id='p-1'>The Context</h2>
<p>The band has never, as far as I know, hit the big time; when I play the music
for other people I usually get a startled “What on earth is
<em>that</em>?!?” reaction.
Shonen Knife was originally a trio: sisters Naoko and Atsuko Yamano and friend
Michie Nakatani.  Michie left in 1999 but the band apparently remains
active.  
I haven’t seen them live.</p>
<p>There is a 1989 album entitled <cite>Every Band Has a Shonen Knife Who
Loves Them</cite> featuring Knife songs performed by other musicians,
including Sonic Youth, Red Kross, L7, and Babes in Toyland.
I’ve never heard it.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Music</h2>
<p>Shonen Knife is obviously a creature of the New Wave era; the songs are
mostly very short and very fast and have a lot of punky guitar-bashing.
But the tunes—including some pure pop gems—would stand out in any genre.
There are a few lightweight tracks without all the
guitar roar.</p>
<p>I have read critical scoffing along the lines of “They’re cute but they
can’t really play”, which is bogus.  They play those tunes <em>fast</em> and
the performances are tight and confident.  Some of the vocal gymnastics are
actually fairly astounding if you listen carefully.</p>
<p>As for <em>Burning Farm</em> (opening lines: “To this vast wasteland/We
will set a flame”), it’s a little longer and a little more complex than the
Shonen Knife average.  The central chant is I’m pretty sure stolen from
somewhere I can’t put my finger on but it’s somewhere good; the singing is
excellent and the drum and guitar parts behind it too, and the bass line is
better; if it doesn’t make your booty want to shake, well, you’re dead.  This
is what intelligent rock &amp; roll should be.
<i>[Update: Tom Harrington writes to identify the chant as being a variation
on the one from <cite>Land of a Thousand Dances</cite>, written by Chris
Kenner and Fats Domino, made famous by Wilson Pickett.  Yep, that’s “somewhere
good”.]</i></p>
<p><cite>Let’s Knife</cite> also has <cite>Milky Way</cite>, a
surf-guitar instrumental.  Surf-guitar instrumentals are, as everyone knows,
the highest achievement of Western Musical Culture, and this one is really not
bad at all.  Screw the critics.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, the sound quality is <em>fabulous</em>, I originally
discovered Shonen Knife in a review in an audiophile magazine.</p>
<p>I don’t know why they’re not famous. Shiny happy songs sung fast and well,
it’s got a back-beat, you could dance to it, what’s not to like?
If you’re
listening to this on headphones out in public you’re running a pretty severe
risk of acting like a complete dork when you start doing dance moves or
an Eighties head-bang; I defy anyone to listen and not want to dance.
Worse, you could start singing along and the men in the white coats might come
for you, because most of the songs are not in any known human language.</p>
<p>Some are in Japanese—probably perfectly sensible Japanese—but most are in 
something somewhat but not entirely unlike English.  For example, the
track titles on <cite>Let’s Knife</cite> include: 
<cite>Bear up Bison</cite>, <cite>Twist Barbie</cite>, <cite>Tortoise Brand
Pot Scrubbing Cleaner’s Theme (Sea Turtle)</cite>, <cite>Antonio Baka
Guy</cite>, <cite>Flying Jelly Attack</cite>, <cite>Black Bass</cite>,
<cite>Cycling Is Fun</cite>, <cite>I Am A Cat</cite>, <cite>Tortoise Brand
Pot Scrubbing Cleaner’s Theme (Green Tortoise)</cite>, <cite>Insect
Collector</cite>, and <cite>Get the Wow</cite>.
Let’s sample the lyrics from one of them, say <cite>Insect
Collector</cite>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Going to a mountain alone with her insect cage<br/>
Lost track of time while waiting for another insect<br/>
Konchu saishu</p>
<p>Going home to give an inspection to a little shell<br/>
Consulting a picture book to see what she collected</p>
<p>Konchu saishu</p>
<p>All arranged neatly in a case and kept with care<br/>
Just before bedtime one more look and she’s happy<br/>
Insect collecting is a hobby few can share<br/>
But when she’s thinks about her insects<br/>
She feels happy, oh so happy, she is happy</p>
<p>She’s an insect collector</p></blockquote>
<p>We can agree that these are, shall we say, eccentric.  Adding to the effect
is the fact that they are sung in an entirely impenetrable Japanese accent.
One suspects that it’s at least partly for effect.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>How to Sample It</h2>
<p>It’s dead easy to find this stuff; Amazon and iTunes both have it, and it’s
on the pirate networks.  But remember, don’t pirate it and don’t buy
the watered-down locked-in iTunes half-music, go buy a nice shiny silver disk
and it’ll sound great and it’ll be yours forever to play however you want.</p>
<p>Speaking of Web stuff, while I was poking around for stuff on Shonen Knife,
I ran across
<a href="http://nippop.com/">nippop</a>, which seems to be just the thing if
you want exhaustive
coverage of all aspects of Japanese popular music.</p>

<title>Nexenta/NetBeans/OS X Notes</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’m running NetBeans 5 on my
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/10/18/New-Computer">Ultra 20</a>,
using 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/02/03/Nexenta">Nexenta GNU/Solaris</a> as the
OS.
This buys a lot of 
performance, but I only want to have one screen/keyboard, so I’m routing the
UI through my Mac via X11.  
I don’t know how common a scenario this is going to be,
but early indications are it’s a damn productive working environment.
I’m discovering some things, so I’ll post them here as I go along in case
other people run across some of the same issues.
<i>[Update: Keymapping progress, whines, and bugs]</i></p>
<p>First of all, did I mention that it’s fast?  I was idly wondering whether
Ubuntu (Linux) or Nexenta (Solaris) ran NetBeans faster, but you’d need a
seriously huge project to find out.  This 2.6G Opteron is a pulverizer; it
builds my little sub-hundred-thousand-line project so fast you wouldn’t be
able to measure it.</p> 
<h2 id='p-1'>ssh -Y</h2>
<p><code>ssh -X</code> doesn’t work.  Well, it sort of works but when you
start NetBeans, it only half comes up and whines about missing X11
extensions and so on.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Anti-Aliasing</h2>
<p>For some reason, NetBeans doesn’t anti-alias by default.  You have to pick
Tools/Options, then switch to “Advanced Options”, then under the Editor
settings there’s a little box you can check to get anti-aliasing.
It looks quite a bit better, but not as good as it could...</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Fonts?</h2>
<p>When I drop into Tools/Options/Fonts &amp; Colors, there are only 11 fonts
to choose from, of which only one, Lucida Sans Typewriter, really seems to be
monospace; and monospace is a necessity.
The Lucida is OK but only OK, 
and when I do an <code>xlsfonts</code>, I see tons of interesting
monospaced-font candidates, so I’m not sure what’s wrong.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Keystrokes/Emacs</h2>
<p>NetBeans offers native-mode, Eclipse-mode, and Emacs-mode keystrokes.
On the Mac, I use native-mode but I have also added the classic Emacs
control-N/P/U/D for next/previous/up/down.
<s>I can’t find the dialog for changing those on the Solaris version, so</s>
Hah, found ’em, they’re under the “Other” header 
and have names beginning “Insertion point to...” in the keymapping preferences
sheet, which needs to be hit with a usability cluestick.
There’s a bug where you can’t use the “Command” (Apple) key as a modifier; if
you tell it to use Command-A to do something, it does it all right, but it
also inserts an “a”.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Firefox</h2>
<p>When I was working with Ubuntu, for some reason Firefox wouldn’t run on the
Ultra and display on my Mac, but it’s hunky-dory with Nexenta; maybe a little
faster than Safari, actually (snicker).
And you can even download the Javadocs and tell NetBeans about them, then when
you hit “show Javadocs” it pops the X11 window with Firefox forward; exactly
as it should be.</p>
<p>Of course, the Javadocs come down as a <code>.zip</code>, and
<code>unzip</code> wasn’t there, but a quick dip into
<a href="http://www.nongnu.org/synaptic/">Synaptic</a> and then it was.
Gotta love that Debian er I mean Nexenta.</p>

<title>Thumbnail Tuning</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I did some fine-tuning.  If you’re reading this in a browser rather than
a feedreader, there’s a little picture in the margin that changes every so
often; clicking on it teleports you into the archives.  It should work better
now and even tells you where it’ll take you.  
If I broke anything, do please let me know.
It’s simultaneously brutally-minimalist and slightly-AJAXy, some geeks might
be amused at the details.</p>
<p>The way it used to work was brutal, involving running an <code>ed</code>
script over an <code>.htaccess</code> file (not kidding, blush).
Not only was this kludgy but sometimes, if you clicked the picture after being
parked on the page for a while, it’d send you to the wrong place.
Plus there was zero indication for the user of where they’d be going.</p>
<p>I wanted the picture link to be stable and simple,
with no redirect voodoo, and I wanted an image title and mouse-over.
It’s not a big deal but it’s been rattling around the back of my head for a
year or more, this afternoon I had an idea and now it’s better.</p>
<p>Now of course, there are lots of <em>easy</em> ways to automate this kind
of thing, but they all involve run-time databases and templates and other
kinds of things that break under pressure and we hates them, my
precioussssss, yes we does.
The <span class='o'>ongoing</span> run-time is entirely based, and will remain
entirely based, on fetching static data out of the filesystem.
I accept that I may be be a little unreasonable on this subject,
but there you go.
The *n*x filesystem is generally-under-appreciated and under-used, and I can
take this puppy quite a bit further without stepping
outside its confines.</p>
<p>So, there’s a batch job that runs every now and then and switches in a new
thumbnail and writes a little XML file with a label and URL for it.
Then there’s a little <code>onLoad</code> script that uses an
<code>XMLHttpRequest</code> to fetch the XML and does some DOM walking and
patching, and there you have it.</p>
<p>Hmm, I seem to remember telling the world that inventing XML tags is
bad and so is serving it as <code>application/xml</code>, and here I am doing
both those things. Seems to work great. Hmm.</p>
<p>Here’s the funny bit; I tested it in Safari and Firefox and got it working
and pushed the “ship” button, then realized I’d forgotten to test in Win/IE.
Furthermore, there’s no such box in my office.  Oops.  Double oops.
Fortunately
<a href="http://www.xmlgrrl.com/blog/">Eve Maler</a> was online and had a
Windows box nearby, with a rarely-used IE on it, and it turned out to be OK.
Anyhow, do please try the mouse-over and if it upsets your browser, do let me
know.</p>

<title>What Do “GNU” and “Linux” Mean?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>These few days of working with the
<a href="http://www.nexenta.com/">Nexenta GNU/Solaris</a> distro have shaken
my assumptions.
Richard Stallman has
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html">repeatedly pointed out</a>
that Linux should be called “GNU/Linux”.  I think he’s right, but
it’s an unlovely and unwieldy mouthful; Like many people, I’m guilty of just
saying “Linux”.  
Unfortunately, that word has come to mean different things to different
people, and the landscape is shifting underneath us.  I think we need to get
our terminology straight.  And what was it that GNU stood for, again?</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>“Linux” for Real People</h2>
<p>The population of nontechnical end user types who sit in front of Linux
boxes is small, but a lot of people are betting that it’ll grow.
Those people, by and large, think a kernel is what you find on a corncob.
If you had to crystallize their end-user experience of Linux it would be
something like “The browser’s great, email and chat are good; on the other
hand I miss Outlook scheduling and the office suite isn’t quite as slick, and
Acrobat is lame.  There are lots of games I can’t play.  But it’s nice and
fast and I never ever get viruses or worms and it doesn’t mysteriously slow
down. Having multiple desktops is nice. And are we ever saving money!”</p>
<p>Which is to say that once you get out of geek circles, “Linux” more or less
means some combination of Gnome + Firefox + OpenOffice + Gaim + fast +
reliable + cheap.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>GNU/What?</h2>
<p>I’d hoped by now to have something profound to say about the differences
between Ubuntu GNU/Linux and Nexenta GNU/Solaris.  But from the point of view
of someone doing some software development and browsing and chatting and image
editing, all on a really fast computer, well... there aren’t any.</p>
<p>Even with Nexenta still in alpha, I bet that if I sat down a few hardened
Unix geeks in front of my Ultra and asked them to do something that involved
some webbing and mailing and coding, quite a while would go by until they
realized that Something Was Different.
And I bet I could keep non-geek “Linux” users fooled indefinitely.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Kernels Matter</h2>
<p>Of course, Solaris and Linux are quite different beasts, and in ways that
matter (if perhaps not that much to the end user sitting there banging text
into Thunderbird).
Let’s see if I can assemble a high-level non-exhaustive list of the
differences between Linux and Solaris (assuming of course the “GNU/” prefix)
that I’ve actually personally noticed myself.
I make no claim that these lists are exhaustive, but they are,
once again, based on personal experience.</p>
<p>For Linux:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Runs on more different computers.</p></li>
<li><p>Supports more devices.</p></li>
<li><p>A lot of software gets ported here first.</p></li>
<li><p>Decent support for plugging things in (USB, external screens, whatever)
and having them Just Work.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For Solaris:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>SMF is better than the aging, clumsy Linux init stuff.</p></li>
<li><p>ZFS is a really good way to manage your disks.</p></li>
<li><p>DTrace is a huge
<a href="http://www.acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=361&amp;page=1">observability</a> win,
so you’ll be ahead when you run into performance problems.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Bear in mind that all of these are things that really only matter
to the developer or the sysadmin; or I suppose to management, because they’ll
have dollars-and-cents implications.</p>
<p>I don’t know which kernel is “faster” or “more reliable” and I don’t think
anybody else does now or will soon, because those questions only really have
answers in the context of a particular workload.  In my experience,
both Debian and Solaris boxes stay up more or less forever.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>What Do We Call It?</h2>
<p>So you’ve got the combination of a Solaris or Linux kernel with a mish-mosh
of GNU, Mozilla, OpenOffice and other random software, and calling it “Linux”
or “Solaris” is misleading.
I think Sun could legally ship something like
this under the name “GNU/Unix”.  Which would be concise, descriptive, 
accurate, and funny.
(Because GNU stands for “Gnu’s Not Unix” and Solaris, after all, is.)</p>
<p>I was chatting this over with 
<a href="http://www.webmink.net/">Simon Phipps</a> and he suggested that 
GNU could stand for “Gnu’s Now Unix”.  <i>[Stop snickering! -Ed.]</i>

<title>FSS: Zürich and Yvoire</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Friday Slide Scan #22 is two pictures from 1990, Zürich at dusk and old
stones in Yvoire.  I have some history with Zürich.</p>
<p>Old Swiss joke: “What do you call 300,000 boring people by a lake in the
middle of Europe?”  “Zürich.”
Indeed, there are funkier places and 
it’s too expensive and you don’t want to ask too many
questions about where the money came from that’s buying those beautiful things
on display in the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahnhofstrasse%2C_Zürich">Bahnofstrasse</a> windows.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the transit is efficient, they’ve got
first-rate universities, and the food is good.  There’s this
incredibly civilized custom where, in the traditional restaurants, they bring
your main course and then after you’ve eaten it,
they bring you seconds.  Also they have the best desserts in the world.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rösti">Rösti</a> are OK by me but I
don’t see why
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raclette">raclettes</a> have to exist.</p>
<img src="1304.jpg" alt="The river Limmat in Zürich, at dusk" />
<p>The picture above is looking down (and across) the river
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limmat">Limmat</a> towards
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Zürich">Lake Zürich</a>.
We’re standing on the expensive side, behind that row of
brightly lit buildings on the other side is Niederdorf Strasse, which is full
of bars and restaurants and and often worth a stroll.</p>
<p>Starting in 1990, the then very young Open Text was doing quite a bit of
business in Switzerland, in part because 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaston_Gonnet">Gaston Gonnet</a>, one of
our co-founders, was a professor at
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETH_Zurich">ETH</a>.
So I went there a lot.</p>
<p>I saw the last days of the infamous Needle Park junkie infestation and the
insides of some very nice bankers’ offices.
One afternoon I was walking among anonymous office buildings with a young
banker; he pointed at one without any bank logos and said “that’s where the
gold is”.  In the fifth basement down, he said, stored partially under
water.</p>
<p>Sometime later that trip, this appeared in my notebook.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Flurstrasse</b></p>
<p>The streets of Zürich writhe in rain,<br/>
torn by cranes, bleeding junkies.</p>
<p>Here, gold walks in the sun —<br/>
the women’s showcased breasts and dense bright hair.<br/>
Crones’ bags bulge with bread, with charms,<br/>
with braids of eaten babies’ locks.<br/>
The dirty poor wear long sleeves here, even in summer.</p>
<p>The hills, yes, the hills rise green,<br/>
green above the lake.<br/>
Bright balloons caress the crags.<br/>
Snow-white houses nestle there —<br/>
windows with begonia bibs<br/>
smile redly down on grey and gold.</p>
<p>Ah, the gold.<br/>
One of many soft grey streets<br/>
holds a dark five-story building<br/>
with (the junior banker said)<br/>
five floors below the five above.<br/>
People fill one, microfilm one,<br/>
two contain computers.</p>
<p>At the bottom<br/>
always hidden square bright anchor,<br/>
bathed in Alp-fresh runoff water,<br/>
at the bottom is the gold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another Swiss business trip took us to Geneva; we had a Saturday off and
decided to drive east along the south shore of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Geneva">Lake Geneva</a>.
This takes you through a bunch of charming places, including Evian, where the
water comes from.
Yvoire is a teeny tiny little village famous for being pretty, and indeed it
is.</p>
<img src="1319.jpg" alt="Yvoire, France" />
<p>Images in the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1953
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>, 
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/08/11/MomsGarden">Jean Bray</a>, Tim Bray, Cath
Bray, and
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>; when I know
exactly who took one, I’ll say; in this case, Tim Bray.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using
a Nikon CoolScan 4000 ED scanner and cleaned up by a combination of the Nikon
scanning software and PhotoShop Elements.</p>

<title>Frontier Justice</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Being administered, in
<a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/confirming-a-penalty/">this case</a>,
by Google’s Matt Cutts.  I think I approve: I suppose there may be some decent,
honorable, intelligent people in the SEO business, but everyone also knows
there are also despicable scum.  Talking to Dave Sifry and Rob Scoble
today at Northern Voice, I learned about some horrible black-hat SEO
techniques that deserve the Instant Internet Death penalty.
I’ve repeatedly heard the Net compared to the Wild West, before the law came
to town.  Until Wyatt Earp gets here, there’s gonna be some vigilante justice
happening.  Whether it’s a good idea or not.</p>

<title>Northern Voice</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There’s a kids’ room
<a href="http://2006.northernvoice.ca/">here</a>, with lots of kids having a
good time.  It’s 
low-pressure, nobody pitching me their start-up in the hallway.</p>
<p>Julie Leung opened, a lovely presentation on stories and telling them; 
much less intense than last year’s, which dealt with death and fear and
the masks we wear.  But still worth listening to.</p>
<img src="IMG_4343.jpg" alt="Julie Leung at Northern Voice" />
<p>Julie held the attention of most of the kids in the crowd (the kids’ room
wasn’t really going yet) for most of her talk; it helped that she was showing
nice pictures.</p>
<p>Dave Sifry and I were less successful in entertaining the children, but the
grown-ups laughed at his jokes; I don’t need to say what happened because
it’s being blogged by multiple other voices out there.</p>
<p>I spent a large part of the day in the kids’ room because Lauren, who was
speaking and on the organizing committee, was busy.  That was OK.
Anyhow, I got to meet a bunch of interesting people including, for the first
time, <a href="http://photomatt.net/">Matt Mullenweg</a>.  I got some
interesting 
feedback on WordPress and Atom 1.0, which I’ll explore separately.</p>
<p>If you’re in the neighbourhood, I heartily recommend Northern Voice; it
probably won’t blow your mind but it might fill it up a little and it
definitely won’t stress you out.</p>

<title>RBD: Bitplanes and Mexican Pop</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>As another side-effect of the recent
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/02/07/Thumbnail">software rejigger</a>, I now
have accurate information about which <span class='o'>ongoing</span> fragments
are actually getting looked at by humans.
One of them, these days, is
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/05/19/RGBPlane">RGB
Planes</a>, from May 2004, a harmless expertise in bit-banging which actually
produced some rather pleasing pictures.  It turns out that one of those pictures
was named
<a href="/ongoing/rgbPlane/rbd.png">rbd.png (have a look, it’s pretty)</a> and
it also turns out that
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBD">RBD</a>, a band out of Mexico, is
hot stuff these days.
The band members are also <i>telenovela</i> stars and hence look good in
pictures; a Google Image Search for “RBD” produces lots of pictures of them,
and my bitplane.  Every day, a couple of hundred of the people who do that
search are taking the time to click it.  If you’re one of them, <i>¡Hola!</i>
You couldn’t make this stuff up.</p>

<title>Blasphemy</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>If you’re going to publish blasphemous pictorials about Middle
Eastern prophets, the least you can do is be funny,
as in 
<a href="http://www.jesusandmo.net/">Jesus and Mo</a>.  The quality is up and
down, but I liked
<a href="http://www.jesusandmo.net/2005/12/07/xmas/">this one</a>.
Actually, I do have two serious comments about the
Danish-cartoons/Muslim-riots story.  First of all, a lot of people in
Arab dictatorships genuinely have no notion that a press <em>can</em> be
independent, so getting mad at the whole country is a little less loony than
it sounds.  If a Syrian paper published something nasty (actually, I suspect
they probably do), it
would be entirely appropriate for reasonable people to get mad at the Syrian
government.
Second, I have advice for religious people who don’t want their prophets or
deities or symbols blasphemed against: <em>curb your crazies</em>.  
Let’s run through some newsmakers in recent times who claimed to be
faith-driven.  On the Muslim side, there’s
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Atta_al-Sayed">Mohamed Atta</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad">President
Ahmadinejad</a>, and various other racist crazies; for the
Christians, Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, and their legions of smarmy grasping
ditto-heads; and for the Jews,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Goldstein">Baruch Goldstein</a>
and Yesha’s
“<a href="http://www.gamla.org.il/english/article/2002/july/b1e.htm">transfer</a>” <i>genocidaire</i>-wannabes.
The Christian batshit-loonies differ from the others in being apparently less
murderous but vastly more hypocritical.
To all the excellent Christians and Jews and Muslims out there: I know you
exist. But you’re vanishing from view behind the cloud of mucky dust being
raised by your lunatic fringe;
as of right now, in the twenty-first century, when someone claims to
be deeply religious, that’s grounds for
suspicion of bigotry, greed, and a predisposition to homicide.
Which is one reason my little boy isn’t being taken to church, for the
moment.</p>

<title>5✭♫: Come On-A My House</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This song was made famous by Rosemary Clooney, but the version I’m writing
of here is by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_London">Julie London</a>, who
recorded 32 albums but is no longer a household name.
Julie’s version of Come On-A My House is just the thing for Valentine’s-Day
week: <i>Come on-a my house
(my house), I’m gonna give you candy...</i>  Pure, pure sex.
<i>(“5✭♫” series introduction <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music">here</a>;
with <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music#p-1">an
explanation</a> of why the title may look broken.)</i></p>
<img class="inline" src="Julie-London.png" alt="Julie London" />
<h2 id='p-1'>The Context</h2>
<p>Julie London came from an entertainment family, grew up in Hollywood, was
discovered as an elevator operator,
married Jack Webb (of <cite>Dragnet</cite>) and jazzbo Bobby Troupe, and
appeared in lots of movies and TV shows.</p>
<p>She said, of her own art: “"It’s only a thimbleful of a voice, and I have
to use it close to the microphone. But it is a kind of oversmoked voice, and
it automatically sounds intimate.”</p>
<p>I’d heard the name, but not the music, until one day I was driving
somewhere and Julie’s version of <cite>Cry Me A River</cite>, which was her
biggest hit, came on the radio, and I was so impressed that I punched up
Lauren on the cellphone and asked her to scribble down “London/Cry me a River”
somewhere for me so I wouldn’t forget.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Music</h2>
<p>I like <cite>Cry Me a River</cite> all right, but I like <cite>Come On-A My
House</cite> more, and on the <cite>Best of Julie
London</cite> collection I picked up at the record store, I also really like
<cite>Hot Toddy</cite>, <cite>A Taste of
Honey</cite>, <cite>My Heart Belongs to Daddy</cite>, <cite>Black
Coffee</cite>, and <cite>Blue Moon</cite>.
Ms. London’s description above of her own voice is pretty fair, I
think; she sighs and swerves, never soars or snarls.  But she’s on the beat
and gets a whole lot of mileage out of every note; no
throwaways.</p>
<p>No song on the collection is longer than 3:18, and pretty well every one is a
little symphony of laughter and desire.  <cite>Come On-A My House</cite> (by
William Saroyan and Ross Bagdasarian) particularly gives me shivers, because
along with the romance (<i>Come on-a my house, my house, I´m gonna give a you
Apple a plum and apricot-a too eh ... Come on-a my house, my house, I´m gonna
give you everything</i>), the song’s got swing, and a melody that you’re going
to find yourself humming as you walk down the hall.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Sampling It</h2>
<p>Julie’s all over the pirate networks, but not this song.  It also doesn’t
seem to be for sale at iTunes, which is OK because iTunes is a
crappy way to buy music.
Poking around on Amazon reveals that it’s on a couple of compilations and
seems to have appeared originally on either
<cite>Love Letters</cite> or <cite>Feeling Good</cite>, which are packaged
together on a CD.
I think I might actually pick that up, because it’s got a few tracks that I
don’t. 
Also, the audio quality on the collection I have is only OK, which is
surprising because in Julie’s prime (starting in 1955) the standards
of recording quality were mostly very high; so I’m hoping they muffed the
remastering.</p>
<p>I suspect that lots of others will find Julie London songs they prefer to
<cite>Come On-A My House</cite>, but I think anyone who likes good songs
sung well, dripping with sex, will find a few to love.</p>

notion of the “Magic Middle”, 150 thousand or so blogs with between 20 and

<title>The Real AJAX Upside</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>People like it because it’s snappy and responsive and lets you do
nifty interactive stuff in the browser.  
But AJAX may be a big enough network-engineering win that the UI sparkle 
starts to look like a fringe benefit.
Herewith some illustrations by example and
a snicker at history.</p>
<p>As I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/02/07/Thumbnail">wrote
recently</a>, I made some updates around the picture rotation here at 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span>, and
I’m kind of fanatical about performance.
Thus, this little meditation.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Servers are Busy</h2>
<p>A really good way to achieve high
performance in a web server is to not look at the data you’re sending out;
just fetch files off the disk (or if you really must, fields out of a
database) and 
pump ’em down the wire as-is.  This allows you to use, almost entirely, the
highly-optimized code paths in your filesystem and database and webserver.
As soon as the server starts doing dynamic data parsing and mingling at
request time,
that’s a potential performance bottleneck, which can cause
a world of pain when you get that real big traffic surge.</p>
<p>A server’s compute resources are usually
at a premium, because it’s, you know, <em>serving</em> lots of different 
client computers out there.
Lots of different computers, you say; and how busy are they?  Not very; your
average Personal Computer usually enjoys over 90% idle time.
So you’ve got a network with a small number of heavily-loaded servers and a
huge number of lightly-loaded clients.
Where do you think it makes sense to send the computation?</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Thumbnail Tweak</h2>
<p>To bring this back to the recent <span class='o'>ongoing</span>
refactoring:
I really don’t want, on the server at runtime, to parse the outgoing page,
figure out where the picture should go, and stitch the current graphics and
article pointers into the HTML.
Instead, I dump that info into a static XML file, let the browser
<code>XMLHttpRequest</code> it (one more cheap static server fetch), and do
the stitching with DOM calls in the browser.
Maybe the DOM-wrangling isn’t all that efficient... but who cares?  The
browser totally doesn’t have anything better to do.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>The Take-Away</h2>
<p>Pretty well all Web-publishing software does lots of templating and dynamic
page generation, and pretty well all of it is piggish, stressing out servers
(and, to be fair, representing a pretty good business opportunity for my
employer).</p>
<p>I suspect there’s a huge system-wide optimization waiting out there for us
to grab, by pushing as much of the templating and page generation work out
there onto the clients.
In particular, when you’re <em>personalizing</em> a page, assign all the work
you can to the <em>personal</em> computer sitting in front of the
<em>person</em> in question. 
Yeah, that cool, responsive AJAXy stuff is nice but maybe it’s the icing on
the cake; the real win is making the Web run faster.
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> doesn’t do any sexy-UI stuff, but you know, the
page content could be a lot more dynamic, and there’s <em>no reason</em> for
it to run slower; or even to upgrade from the single fairly-basic
Athlon that hosts it.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>History</h2>
<p>You know, I could be excused for being a little bitter here.
Everybody’s all gaga these days about AJAX as 
<a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">meme-ified by Jesse James Garrett</a>.
Check out 
<a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/03/14/taxi.html">Taxi to the Future</a>, a piece I wrote for XML.com in 2001,
talking about how to improve user experience and system performance with a
<b>T</b>ransform-<b>A</b>ggregate-send <b>X</b>ML-<b>I</b>nteract
architecture.  Remind you of anything?</p>
<p>But you know, I’m actually not crying in my beer because first, Garrett
was in the right place at the right time with the right acronym, and secondly,
<a href="http://spaces.msn.com/siteexperts/">Scott Isaacs</a> has been talking
about this stuff since 1998 and helped invent most of the underlying
technology, but dammit Scott,
how could you ever expect to hit the memescape big-time with a dorky name like
“Dynamic HTML”?</p>
<p>It’s all good.</p>

I’ve left Safari behind, then
gone back to it, several times now, but its latest sin is random unpredictable

<title>OSBC San Francisco 2006</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I spent the last two days at
<a href="http://osbc.com/live/13/events/13SFO06A">OSBC West</a>.  
The attendees were overwhelmingly Open-Source vendors, with a sprinkling of
venture caps and journalists.  The buzz was palpable, even if the mix was a
little odd; good suits contrasting with T-shirts; IRC channels and Slashdot
visible on laptop screens.  There were so many journalists there that Sun PR
managed to set me up ten (!) briefings over the course of the two days, so I
didn’t get to hear many of the talks.
<a href="http://www.roughtype.com/">Nicholas Carr</a> looked at
electrical-industry history, covering some of the
same same territory that Jonathan Schwartz
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan/20050130">has been over</a>, but going a lot
deeper and drawing a pretty convincing analogy, I thought.
I caught a few minutes of
<a href="http://www.kapor.com/">Mitch Kapor</a> talking up Wikipedia; he’s a
good strong-voiced clear-headed advocate.
The press briefings went OK except for when Paul Krill, who’s really an
excellent tech writer, accidentally hit one of my hot buttons by asking
whether bloggers are 
really reliable, given that they don’t have professional fact-checking and
editing support.  Given that I’m still
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/22/Washington-Post-Goof">mad
at the Washington Post</a> for egregious uncorrected lying, I kind of snarled
at Paul, which was unfortunate as it was a reasonable question.
I was on two panels; one, on LAMP, was interesting (Zend’s Doron Gerstel and
ActiveGrid’s Peter Yared: “PHP rules!”  Me: “LAMP’s growing fast, resistance
is silly”).  The other, on Open Source and Open Standards, was kind of boring,
with Microsoft’s excellent Jason Matusow furiously reframing and recasting,
and nobody else getting quite irritated enough to start the polemics, which
may have amounted to cheating the audience.
Oh, another thing about OSBC: the food is really excellent.</p>

<title>Viiv Jive</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A few weeks back, I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/14/On-Intel">raised my
eyebrows</a> over  Paul Otellini’s notion that Intel would find success by
“communicating
clearly what the technology can do for consumers” because “you can’t just talk
about the bits and bytes”.  On an airplane, scanning through a New Yorker, I
ran up against the first evidence of this; a glossy four-page spread trying to
build their “Viiv” branding.  
I gotta say, they’re trying to do just what Otellini said they would, but it’s
kind of puzzling.</p>
<p>The spread features incredibly-handsome young movie director Bennett
Miller, dressed in black of course, striking relaxed poses in an all-white
Manhattan-flavored apartment with a klunky tower-form-factor PC (no visible

<title>FSS: Wood in Black and White</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Friday Slide Scan #23 is another December-1985 Pacific Rim shot; the wood
is driftwood, most of its colour bleached out.</p>
<img src="0644.jpg" alt="Bleached Pacific Rim driftwood" />
<p>There’s a lot happening in that old wood, you might want to expand it and
take a closer look.</p>
<p>The beaches of the Pacific Rim are are cluttered with lots of driftwood
(not just sticks, some of them are driftlogs),
convenient for both hikers and loafers, be they looking for shade,
windscreens, or just something to lean on.
Some is from naturally-fallen trees, but the vast majority represents
by-products of the logging industry, which has left huge slices of the Rim,
the parts tourists don’t see, in a ravaged and loveless state.</p>
<p>There are way more than two sides to that issue; and in any case, I think
this one was natural driftwood.</p>
<p>Images in the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1953
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>,

Bray, and
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>; when I know
exactly who took one, I’ll say.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using
a Nikon CoolScan 4000 ED scanner and cleaned up by a combination of the Nikon
scanning software and PhotoShop Elements.</p>

<title>Lower the Anchor</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A decade or two ago, a new pattern crept into broadcast journalism.
In both radio and TV newscasts, when there’s a report from an on-the-scene
correspondent, the anchor drops into Q&amp;A mode, “interviewing” the
reporter: “Well, Joe, do we know what the neighbors think of this latest development?“
This is lame and stupid and it sucks and it’s time to stop doing it;
the anchor should say “Let’s go to Joe,
who’s on the scene” and then <em>shut up</em>.  It may be the case that
they’ve had time to script Joe’s 
report, or in a hot-news situation, they may just be tossing Joe the ball to
give us his best judgment as to what’s most newsworthy; either way this is
Joe’s story, not the anchor’s.
At the end of the day the news anchor is just a good suit, good voice, and
good hair.  It’s the reporter who’s doing the actual journalism and that’s
where the focus should be.</p>

<title>On PHP</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I should really buckle down and try writing a PHP app because, at the
moment, I have an attitude problem.  I know that IBM now officially loves it,
and Tim O’Reilly’s been
charting the upcurve in PHP book sales, and everyone’s saying that Oracle’s
going to buy Zend.  If you want your ears bent back, have a listen to Zend CEO
Doron Gerstel; he’ll tell you that half the websites in the world are powered
by PHP and that there are 2&#xbd; million developers and that the war is over
and PHP won.
So here’s my problem, based on my limited experience with PHP (deploying a
couple of free apps to do this and that, and debugging a site for a
non-technical friend here and there): all the PHP code I’ve seen in that
experience has been messy, unmaintainable crap.  Spaghetti SQL wrapped in
spaghetti PHP wrapped in spaghetti HTML, replicated in slightly-varying form
in dozens of places.
Everyone agrees on PHP’s upsides: it’s written for the web, it’s easy to
deploy and get running, and it’s pretty fast.  Those are important
advantages.  
And I’m sure that it’s <em>possible</em> to write clean, comprehensible,
maintainable, PHP; only apparently it’s real easy not to.
But PHP has competition, most obviously Rails; and don’t write the Java EE
crowd off, they’re not stupid at all and they’re trying to learn the lessons
that PHP is trying to teach.
So PHP has earned everyone’s respect by getting where it is,
and Sun should reach out to it more than we have.
But in the big picture, it feels vulnerable to me.

<p>If you want some support on your foray into PHP, please let me know. I’d
love to lend a hand.</p>
<p>It’s easy to write bad code in PHP. Or in Perl. Or in C. Or Java. I
think two things contribute to the perception that PHP code is crap.
First of all, when you write spaghetti PHP, it still works just fine. So
unless you’re a professional programmer or maintaining lots of code, you
probably don’t care that the code is crap.</p>
<p>Secondly, since PHP is easy to learn, is ubiquitous, and there’s lots of
PHP examples on the web, it’s easy for a non-pro to pick up PHP and
start monkeying with it. They learn bad habits and then publish their
code and teach others bad habits. Some of the most popular open source
PHP applications ever are really poorly coded. Gallery and Wordpress
come to mind.</p>
<p>A hammer can be used to build a beautiful structure or a mis-shapen
birdhouse. And it’s easy to flatten your thumb. With so many amateur PHP
developers out there, it’s not surprising there’s a lot of flat-thumb
code in the wild.</p>

<p>I’ve just read your post on PHP...  If you do get around to writing that book, it needs to be called “PHP for programmers” because that’s the market that’s been 100% unrepresented so far.</p>
<p>I’m in 100% agreement with you about the whole PHP thing.  Every time I’ve looked at PHP, I’ve been unable to find out how they use placeholders in code that talks to the database.  Yes, every database adaptor provides a quote function, but nobody uses it (consistently). And people wonder why PHP code is always full of security holes.</p>
<p>It’s a real shame, as I can see that there’s a lot to like in PHP.  But it really needs to clean its act up to appeal to people coming from other programming languages, instead of just people coming from dreamweaver.</p>
<p>I actually heard David Heinemeier Hansson (sp?) talking about rails the other day.  One of the key points he made is that it should be easy to do the right thing.  That’s why Rails hits a sweet spot for me.  But when you look at PHP, yes, it’s easy to code, but it’s not easy to do the right thing.  That’s where it falls down.</p>

<p>I think you are right in that one of the problems of PHP is that it is so easy to produce really horrible code. And there is a huge amount of horrible PHP out there.</p>
<p>But PHP can be elegant, can be used right. I make no claim as to what is ‘best’ but I am convinced it can be an excellent choice for web applications. It may not be love but we are certainly very fond of PHP.</p>
<p>I have got an example... at least of an attempt to do things right. My company has developed a PHP based web application framework which we use internally for all sorts of projects. It’s very similar, in principal, to Rails, but we use PHP instead of Ruby. And while the code certainly isn’t perfect we try to do our best.</p>
<p>We’ve considered open sourcing the framework (we call it Stageblocks) but haven’t done that yet, mostly because we haven’t got round to it rather than any philosophical problem. There are already a lot of competing frameworks and Zend are apparently about to do their own which means it is unlikely it would gain any traction.</p>
<p>But it works great for us. We may open source it anyway but there is an admin overhead just in getting everything in place and we’re a very small (5 person) and young company. Bear with us.</p>
<p>Having said that, if you were interested in looking at the code (as an example of some, hopefully, elegant PHP) then I’d be delighted to send you a copy of a standard install subject to it being kept in reasonable confidence (or something, nothing formal).</p>
<p>In case you are remotely interested I’ve attached three very simple files pulled out of a current project by way of introduction. A sample model, view and a controller.</p>
<p>Finally, can I just reassure you that this really isn’t some kind of sales message. I’m not ‘looking’ for anything here, just responding to your blog which I thoroughly enjoy reading ;-)</p>
<p>Of course, having said all that we think, ultimately, Ruby may threaten PHP if it continues to grow as rapidly as it is currently is. We’re all dabbling with Ruby (especially Rails) at the moment and it is an enticing option.</p>
<p>All the best</p>

<p>Well - it hasn’t been proven that users *can’t* write clean, comprehensible,
maintainable PHP - but it also hasn’t been proven that anyone can.</p>
<p>The smartest guy I know, and I know some scary-smart people, spent a
significant amount of time building a test-jig and class library for
developers to build up system integration tests in PHP. (The reasons for the
language selection were mundane and/or pointy-haired).</p>
<p>In the end it was a scary failure, even though it was only deployed to a
small group of relatively proficient developers, working in an extremely
narrow use case, testing just one application.</p>
<p>At the very lowest level, there is no way to enforce discipline in checking
return codes - there is no “set -e” equivalent. So, you can spend a lot of
time writing wrappers that do things like call an operation and then check
that the operation didn’t complain...but you can’t prevent the users from
circumventing the checks.</p>
<p>Loose typing is post-modern and fun, but the language needs a way to say
“but seriously now”.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of other little unfixable details which time has
graciously allowed me to forget.</p>
<p>Put differently, you can’t put more safety into a language than it ships
with. I seriously doubt that any developer can build a production-quality
app using PHP. For the record, I don’t consider even big-name web sites to
be “production-quality”, because they fall back on a squishy meat-bag to
click “refresh” if
something goes wrong.</p>
<p>I wish we had used that same developer time to grout tile rather than build
on PHP.</p>

<p>PS: Oracle has made at least one monumentally stupid purchase in the last
year, so I don’t think their alleged interest in Zend means anything...</p>

<h2 id='p-13'>Tony Fisk</h2>
<p>It may seem obvious to a veteran like yourself, but I have always had a mental
block went it came to understanding how languages like Perl or Python are used
to write web pages. HTML I can understand, and I have written Python scripts
for stand alone use, but I always felt that a piece of the puzzle was missing. </p>
<p>This piece was first provided to me by PHP. Embedding the code in html and
telling the webserver to use a preprocessor gives me a simple process to
follow and understand.</p>
<p>So, I appreciate PHP for the leg-up it gave me, if nothing else. Now, having
spent a large portion of the last year trying to de-obfuscate a large amount
of legacy PHP code (and learn to program for the web!), I definitely
appreciate that it’s *real* easy not to write something clean, comprehensible
and maintainable!! </p>
<p>However, I don’t think the fault was wholly with PHP! I think bad code can be
written in any language (just as good code can be written with gotos, not that
I’d want to). I recently was given some Ruby code to tweak, and encountered a
situation where fully populated variables were appearing out the blue with no
indication of how they were defined! I spent a day or two trying to work out
where the magic happened. It turned out that the original author was using an
obscure Ruby feature rather than a named array to pass variables via the
symbol table. Hyperspatial travel is clever, perhaps, but far from obvious!</p>
<p>PHP may not be the most polished language out there, but it’s OK, rich, and
workable. It feels much like C, with a few extra bells and whistles (foreach,
typelessness, and some OO support that’s not great, but is supposedly better
than Perl. There’s even a unit testing package available: SimpleTest
<a href="http://www.lastcraft.com/simple_test.php">http://www.lastcraft.com/simple_test.php</a>). So clean, well structured code is
certainly possible. </p>
<p>Where people might fall in a hole is in understanding how a PHP script runs: a
bit like a cascading state machine that finally stabilises into a web page
showing one bit of html or another, depending on the initial conditions.
Trying to allow for different results in the same script can lead to a lot of
decision making and lots of “if” statements if you don’t understand
subroutines and the power of function references.</p>
<p>In covering the field of scripting languages for the web, you might like to
consider a dark horse: Spyce (<a href="http://spyce.sourceforge.net/">http://spyce.sourceforge.net/</a>), which provides a
PHP like environment for Python. Given my own learning experiences, and given
that Python is a much cleaner language than PHP, I can see the benefits! I
haven’t used Spyce much, but it seems to work OK, and has a cute logo.</p>

<p>Over on the SitePoint blogs, Harry starts a conversation with
<a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2006/02/20/tim-bray-on-php/">Tim Bray
on PHP</a>; there’s tons of follow-up commentary.</p>
<h2 id='p-15'>Henry Sivonen</h2>
<p>I noticed that neither you post nor the comments mentioned PHP’s lack of Unicode support. Strings are byte strings. There is no Unicode string type. Also, functions for working with the byte strings as UTF-8 strings are missing from the repertoire of standard built-in functions. (There are multibyte string extension functions, but they are not guaranteed to be available and, hence, cannot be used.)</p>
<p>In the 21st centure, just ignoring Unicode in the standard library and data types is pretty amazing in a bad way. (Disclaimer: My experience is with PHP4, but people who have used PHP5 say nothing has changed in this area, which is, in a way, even more disturbing.)</p>
<p>I once wanted to add a feature to the in-house CMS of fiMUG (Finnish
Macintosh User Group;
<a href="http://fimug.fi/">http://fimug.fi/</a>) and discovered that I needed
conversion between UTF-8 and Windows-1252. It was not part of the platform. I
had to write the code myself as an app developer! That’s code which in Java,
Python or Perl is part of the standard library. When I was done porting a
converter (<a href="http://hsivonen.iki.fi/php-utf8/">http://hsivonen.iki.fi/php-utf8/</a>) from Mozilla’s code base (the first place where I could find one), I no longer had the time to implement the feature I needed the converter for.</p>
<p>As for code quality, I later found PHP examples that dealt with UTF-8 and none of them used the obvious bitwise operations that any programmer familiar with low-level stuff would use with UTF-8.</p>
<p>Also, I think the entire concept of mixing program code with snippets of HTML source text is inherently tag soupish and spaghetti-inducing. It only appears to work because HTML browsers are forgiving. (JSP is not any better. It combines the tag soupness of PHP with the heaviness of Java.)</p>

<p>It’s true that most PHP you will encounter is ugly spaghetti-code that does nothing more than what it’s meant to do and leave whoever reads it in disgust. So why is it so popular?</p>
<p>The people telling you that PHP is (one of) the most popular web programming language are probably fanatics, as there is an equally great amount of ASP.NET and Java, J2EE and JSP programmers out there. The latter groups are simply less vocal about it, and they are less scattered and widespread.</p>
<p>PHP is like HTML in that it is extremely easy to get a head start in. You don’t need to know much about programming to start using PHP for some basic scripts and functionality, just like you don’t really need to know anything about semantic markup to start (ab)using HTML. For these same reasons, it has become so popular.</p>
<p>There are many little script examples for PHP because so many people want and need them. PHP largely caters to a crowd that doesn’t care much about programming, but rather about having some server-side power and functionality they can use in their site.</p>
<p>ASP.NET and Java programmers (going by examples that I know personally) are more recluse in their presence online. People programming in these languages are more likely to be actual programmers who want to do programming, and thus take it seriously. This doesn’t necessarily equate to *good* programmers, or quality code for that matter, but these aren’t as often people who just want a little scripting added to their site.</p>
<p>PHP, with its embedded nature, makes such things incredibly easy. These people then post their code as examples to others, and so it spreads. We see it with the millions of horrible HTML tutorials on the Web, we see it with PHP examples. It’s much less so with ASP.NET or Java because those languages are a lot harder to work with and thus don’t appeal to the “quick and dirty” crowd — a crowd that is unbelievably large.</p>
<p>But all this doesn’t make PHP a bad language by itself. Like Javascript, it’s not the language that is to blame for the horrible uses, but the people using it in evil ways.</p>
<p>I have been creating Content Management Systems in PHP and SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL) for over 5 years straight, now, and my code has changed from the typical PHP-crud to very clean, reusable and efficient code. I’ve learned from good examples such as vBulletin’s PHP code (that, as of version 3.x, could be considered a great example), but good examples may have clean and efficient code, they are too complex to be understood by that very big “quick and dirty” crowd that makes up a large portion of the PHP user base.</p>
<p>What PHP’s challenge is right now is its slow improvement, and the fact that a lot of skilled PHP coders have become incredibly elitist and rude, making it unappealing for newcomers and beginners to learn proper coding methods. In contrast, the Ruby on Rails crowd is growing rapidly and its user base is much friendlier and helpful, making RoR a good candidate for knocking PHP off its (self-imposed) throne position.</p>
<p>In the end, we may all be better off with that outcome, because there’s no sign whatsoever that PHP will ever become a predominantly clean language, not even counting all their UTF-8 issues.</p>

<p>The
<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/">CBC</a> Olympics coverage on its
<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/hdtv/">HDTV channel</a> is just outstanding.
Good picture, good schedule, and  good commentary.  
The NBC feed is is not as egregiously sugar-coated as previous US offerings,
but the US-centricity really gets old fast.
The CBC’s video logo/trailer is an outstanding piece of eye candy; is it online
anywhere?
There are even occasional high-def ads. One in particular from Target,
reminiscent in style of their big

<title>InfoWorld Goes Off the Rails</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I got this email, subject “Enterprise Server Spotlight”, that was sorta
kinda from InfoWorld, and it took me to a Web page that was sorta kinda
InfoWorld, and the whole sequence was very disturbing.
<i>[Update: InfoWorld responds; “Never ascribe to malice...” as the saying
goes.]</i></p>
<p>Here’s what I got from InfoWorld:</p>
<blockquote><ol>
<li><p>Omeda is InfoWorld’s third-party fulfillment house. They manage
InfoWorld’s circulation database and we utilize them for most of our email
deployments.  In addition, InfoWorld also uses Commerce Register as an
email partner.  Both Omeda and Commerce Register are trusted InfoWorld
partners.</p></li>
<li><p>InfoWorld’s policy is to label “Sponsored” content. The Microsoft
Spotlight cited was an error; we have since corrected it.</p></li>
<li><p>InfoWorld maintains a clear opt-in and opt-out policy. If anyone
received an email in error or wishes to no longer receive communications
from InfoWorld, they can unsubscribe using the link provided at the bottom
of each email message.  Or they can contact customerservice@infoworld.com
and ask to be opted out of all future email.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Steve Fox<br/>
Editor in Chief</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First of all, thanks to InfoWorld for noticing!</p>
<p>I actually do occasionally get “what’s hot today” emails from InfoWorld and
even read them some times, so
I must have opted into something.  This Microsoft piece really stood out,
though, so I guess I need to go over to InfoWorld and make sure I don’t have
the “Please spam me” box checked; or maybe just unsubscribe from
everything.</p>
<p>As for item 2, shit happens; and indeed if I go visit that page now,
there’s a little “Special Advertising Partner” banner.  This is the kind of
mistake the trade press can’t afford too much of.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Original Post</h2>
<p>I’ll reproduce some parts of the email:</p>
<pre>From: 	        ifwd@ifw-media.com

Dear ,

Find out how Microsoft Windows Server System can boost productivity 
while maintaining the highest levels of security and data integrity 
by visiting InfoWorld's Enterprise Server Spotlight:
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://ifw-media.com/lrd0_AAPDAwAD3lsB">http://ifw-media.com/lrd0_AAPDAwAD3lsB</a>

By visiting the Enterprise Server Spotlight, you will learn 
how Microsoft's cost-effective, best-of-breed Enterprise 
Server platforms offer:
Security 
Reliability
Indemnification
Scalability</pre>
<p>... and lots more of the same.
Hmm.  I wondered what “ifw-media” was, and WHOIS
took me to
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.omeda.com/">OMEDA COMMUNICATIONS</a>, who say they’re “the
industry leader in fulfillment and database management for
business-to-business trade publications and business marketers”.  So what
happened to me was “fulfillment”, eh?  I wonder why it felt like spam?</p>
<p>Anyhow, that link redirected to 
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.infoworld.com/spotlights/microsoft/">http://www.infoworld.com/spotlights/microsoft/</a>,
and I’m going to reproduce a screen grab of what’s above the fold.
<i>[Update: Per a suggestion from
<a href="http://annevankesteren.nl/">Anne van Kesteren</a>, I equipped all
those links with <code>rel="nofollow"</code>. Snicker.]</i></p>
<img src="Infoworld-Ad-Page.png" alt="Semi-advertising page from Infoworld" />
<p>The thing that bothers me here is that there’s an InfoWorld header,
followed an obvious Microsoft advertisement, followed by what looks like
editorial copy but <em>reads</em> like more Microsoft advertising, and then
towards the bottom of the screen grab there’s another advertisement, helpfully
labeled “Advertisement”.</p>
<p>Which might lead a reasonable person to suspect that the material between
the two explicit advertisements is, you know, the output of journalists
working at the publication whose logo is at the top of the page.</p>
<p>I don’t need to explain why this really, really sucks.
It hurts a little more because I’ve generally tended to have quite a lot of
respect for InfoWorld, and some of my favorite tech writers hang their hats
there.</p>

<title>Un-Fascist Business</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I ran across this Dow-Jones story entitled
<a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/siliconvalley/business/columnists/13899756.htm?source=rss&amp;channel=siliconvalley_columnists">Dissident XM Satellite director a good role model</a>;
it’s about a Board-level dispute at XM Satellite Radio.  
The argument is simple and straightforward: whether they should focus on costs
and profitability, or go all-out for growth; the right answer isn’t obvious.  
Lots of businesses have had this
kind of argument; I’ve been in a few myself. 
What’s unique here is that they’re having it out in the open. In my two
decades in business, I’ve seen a whole lot of management (sometimes
Board-level) arguments, and the more important they are and the harder the
problem is, the more fanatically determined people were to keep things secret.
For most of my lifetime, the dominant school of management thought has held
that the company must present a cheerful, united, confident face to the world
and speak always with one voice and only one voice.
I think a reasonable case can be made that this thinking is, in its essential
characteristics, 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism">Fascist</a>.
It also strikes me as really, really dumb.  
How could anyone think the less of
XM Radio because we know they’re agonizing over profitability-vs-growth?
Unless the issue is something like “Oops, the new product is causing users to
develop liver cancer”, I think that in general businesses would benefit from
working on their hard problems a little more transparently.</p>

<title>OSBC Pix</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I unloaded the pix from camera and there were a couple from the 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/02/16/OSBC">OSBC trip</a> last week, which
gives me an excuse to say a couple more words about the conference, Microsoft,
and copyblogging.</p>
<p>You know, as long as I keep flying back and forth between Vancouver and San
Francisco with a camera in my pocket, <span class='o'>ongoing</span> readers
are going to have to look at the occasional aerial shot.
Boy, did this one ever make me wish I had the big camera.</p>
<img src="IMG_4369.jpg" alt="Sun-dappled San Francisco, from the air" />
<p>As I’ve done before, I took the BART downtown and, as I’ve done before, I
fell prey to the photographic lures of a white brick building.
Both these photos are egregiously PhotoShopped.</p>
<img src="IMG_4360.jpg" alt="White building on Market Street, San Francisco" />
<h2 id='p-1'>The Conference</h2>
<p>I mentioned that we’d had a lot of interviews; Dan Farber, who really
gave us a workout, decorated
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=2604">his piece</a> with a picture of
me and Sun CIO
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/BVass">Bill Vass</a>, so I thought
I’d return the favor.</p>
<img src="IMG_4365.jpg" alt="Dan Farber at OSBC, San Francisco" />
<p>Dan’s piece turned up in my vanity feed since he mentioned my name, then it
turned up thirty or forty more times.  Holy cow, are there are ever a lot of
spamblogs and copyblogs out there pirating ZDNet content.  Blecch.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>That Panel</h2>
<p>Andy Updegrove’s
<a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/newsblog/blog.php?ID=2058">write-up</a>
on the “Open Standards and Open Source” noted that I hadn’t said much about
the panel.</p>
<p>Here’s what’s wrong; we were all much too polite. There is a huge, gaping,
existential gap, at this moment in history, between Microsoft and the rest of
the industry.  For
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/11/30/Office-Profits">simple, easy to
understand business reasons</a>, Microsoft is fighting ferociously to maintain
their desktop lock-down.  
Right now a lot of Microsoft’s competitors
<em>and</em> customers would like to crack the desktop open, and Microsoft
doesn’t want that to happen.</p>
<p>During that panel, somebody should have said “Open Source and Open
Standards aren’t the same thing at all, or even necessarily related, but they
do have one thing in common: they are daggers aimed at the heart of
Microsoft’s monopoly; there would be huge global business benefits if there
were a free desktop marketplace, and Open Source and Open Standards would help
get us there, and so Microsoft is against them.”</p>
<p>But we didn’t.  One reason is that Jason Matusow is a nice guy and a smart
guy and it’s human nature to flinch from open conflict.  I still think the
audience was in some respect cheated.</p>

<title>5✭♫: Plutonian Nights</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is a track by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Ra">Sun Ra</a> from his album
<cite>The Lady With The Golden Stockings</cite>, recorded around 1958 and
released  in 1966.
Sun Ra, full legal name “Le Sony’r Ra”, born Herman Blount, said a lot of
crazy stuff and played some crazy music, some of which I like.  But this isn’t
crazy, it’s 4:22 of low-voiced cool funk perfection.
<i>(“5✭♫” series introduction <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music">here</a>;
with <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music#p-1">an
explanation</a> of why the title may look broken.)</i></p>
<img src="Sun-Ra-and-June-Tyson.png" alt="Sun Ra and June Tyson" />
<div class="caption"><p>Sun Ra and June Tyson; copied with thanks from
<a href="http://plexifilm.com/index.html">plexifilm</a>, which looks like a
nice place. There were no
apparent copyright statements, so I hope I haven’t hurt their feelings.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Context</h2>
<p>Sun Ra, probably born in 1914 (died in 1993), played keyboards, got into
jazz early, was a 
conscientious objector during WWII, then in 1952 got the name change and
announced he’d come to earth from Saturn.
As the Fifties and Sixties went by, his jazz got increasingly outside, and
his dozens of records include plenty of tracks that are all screeching free-form
high notes coupled with a thundering horde of disorganized bongos.  Sometimes
just the horns, sometimes just the bongos, sometimes both.  
In these works, occasionally voices chant something somewhat but not
completely unlike poetry. These have
generally not worn well.
Just to make sure the visuals were as jarring as the music, Mr. Ra and the
band took to appearing in regalia which mostly ancient-Egyptian and entirely
bizarre.</p>
<p>But in between the noise, and peering past the outfits, there was some
pretty superior jazz being played.  A major contributor to the sound and music
was saxophonist 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gilmore_%28musician%29">John Gilmore</a>
(no, not
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gilmore_%28advocate%29">that</a>
John Gilmore), who at one time gave lessons to John Coltrane (!); those
unimpressed by Sun Ra’s Egyptian/Saturnian shtick were sometimes heard to
wonder why Gilmore wasted his time in that band.</p>
<p>I don’t remember when I ran across Sun Ra, which is appropriate
because it was in the Seventies.  My LP collection includes something
called <cite>Nuits de la Fondation Maeght</cite> on a label called “Shandar”,
recorded live in France in August 1970.  I suspect this is pretty hard to
find, which is a pity, because Side A is excellent end-to-end.
Side B?  OK if you’re an Egyptian-Saturnian phanboy.</p>
<p>I also have a late work on the estimable
<a href="http://www.rounder.com/">Rounder</a> label called
<cite>Something Else</cite>, recorded in 1988 and ’89.  It only goes slightly
outside and has nothing that will change your life, but the title is
appropriate because it doesn’t sound much 
like anything else, every track has rhythmic integrity, and it’s a solid listen.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Music</h2>
<p><cite>Plutonian Nights</cite> is straight-ahead cool jazz.  The opening
rhythm-section 
makes weird but effective use of the piano’s very bottom strings, then
it segues into a conventional horn vamp, except for Gilmore’s bass-saxophone
continuo, mixed loud and front and center, is approximately the
funkiest sax part in the history of the universe.
Eventually you get some nice breaks, clarinet (I think) and bowed bass, then
the funky horns come back to shiver your timbers for a minute or so on the way
out.</p>
<p>Play this one when there’s people over and they don’t think they’re there
to listen to music, and they’ll be asking you what it is and listening
hard.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Sampling It</h2>
<p>I originally found <cite>Plutonian Nights</cite> on Napster-that-was
because it was pretty well the 
only Sun Ra out there.  A few intervening hunts through record stores to find
<cite>The Lady With The Golden Stockings</cite> led nowhere, but while I was 
writing this I discovered a CD re-release combining it with
<cite>The Nubians of Plutonia</cite> on sale for a fair price, so I ordered
it.  Hey RIAA, get a fucking clue.</p>
<p>There’s a sample up on Amazon, you can hear a few seconds of that
kozmick bass saxophone.</p>

<title>Management Blogchain</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’m kind of overrun with things I want to write about; I was looking
dispiritedly at the “blog this” list and I noticed a nifty
intersection with my management chain.  OK, maybe it’s kind of a feeble hook,
but I get to knock three things off the list; herewith interesting stuff from
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/stern">Stern</a>, 
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/johnnyl">Loiacono</a>, and 
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan">Schwartz</a>, but there’s
a missing link.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Hal</h2>
<p>Hal’s been the Software CTO (&amp; hence my manager) since May last year.
I wanted to point out his
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/stern?entry=long_tails_of_sun_s">Long 
Tails of Sun’s Analyst Summit</a> as evidence that, in running around talking
about dynamic languages and LAMP, I’m not some lone-wolf crazy.
We really mean it; stay tuned.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>JohnnyL</h2>
<p>Mr. Loiacono is Exec VP of Software (hence on Jonathan’s staff) and is
never called anything but Johnny. 
What with one thing and another, I’d never actually met him until last week,
when we had a face-to-face and I learned a whole lot real quick about the
business issues around our software operation (and I got to rant about some of
my hobby-horses).  
Most of his blog entries echo our corporate message-of-the-day pretty
closely, but earlier this month he fired off
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/johnnyl?entry=no_more_ready_fire_aim">No More “Ready-Fire-Aim” User Experiences</a>,
which addresses the fact that Sun’s software products have not, shall we say,
uniformly been famous for user-interface excellence.  Good piece, something
that needed to be said; let’s see if we can execute.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Jonathan</h2>
<p>I’ve actually known Jonathan way longer than either Hal or Johnny.
And just to be clear: the reason I took this job, and the reason I’m still here,
is to be part of the the campaign, with Jonathan at the middle of it, to take
a good company in bad trouble and make it good again.</p>
<p>Anyhow, his recent post
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan?entry=coffee_and_keynotes">including
the Ning server-cost analysis</a> is real interesting.
The most surprising thing is that they were looking at the Opteron boxes
instead of the T2000, especially since they’re watts/rack constrained.</p>
<p>Also, Jonathan’s comments have been turned on, which I predicted wouldn’t
work but 
that well, but it has; the conversation around the cost calculations is
energetic and informative.</p>
<p>Sigh, my arguments for not having comments keep getting weaker and
weaker.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>The Missing Link</h2>
<p>Well, that’s not my whole management chain; there’s a Scott somebody in
there, absent so far in the blogosphere.  I thought it was supposed to thrive
on strong, occasionally surprising, personal voices.</p>

<title>Favorites</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Technorati launched 
<a href="http://www.technorati.com/faves/">Favorites</a> today.
it’s a simple enough idea, you nominate a bunch of your favorite feeds and
they’re available both as a page to visit and an aggregated feed anyone can
subscribe to.  For example,
<a href="http://www.technorati.com/faves/TimBray">here are mine</a>;
obviously, I haven’t had a lot of time to put into the selection.
Near as I can tell, this is much like what Dave Winer’s been calling
<a href="http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/howtoReadingLists">Reading
Lists</a>, only with a reasonable GUI.  One assumes there’ll be an
import/export feature eventually, to make them portable.
The next step is reasonably obvious: instead of just “Joe’s favorites”
you could imagine “Joe’s budget travel feeds” and “Joe’s manga-fan
feeds”.  But maybe that’s a false vision; the whole thing about a blog is that
it’s a clearly-sourced well-defined voice, so maybe an individual person’s
favorites is what you really want.
Frankly, I’m not sure what the use-case here is; but then again, we’re just
making this stuff up as we go along.  <i>[Disclosure: I have a

or, the *only* real choice, use Atom instead.”
It works for some other people 
<a href="http://www.us-cert.gov/channels/">who really care about security</a>,
too.
But maybe the security’s just a sideshow; the real benefit of moving to Atom
would be to avoid the

<title>What Dave Said</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’d just like to highlight Dave Winer’s 
<a href="http://www.scripting.com/2006/02/22.html#whyFormatsLikeRss20Work">remarks today</a>
on
<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss#roadmap">the RSS 2.0 roadmap</a>.
Nobody can say Dave hasn’t been 100% crystal-clear about this.
Those of us who thought there was basic, important work that still needed doing
in the area of syndication formats had three choices; RDF-wrangling in the RSS
1.0 context, namespace-wrangling in the
RSS 2.0 context, and putting a new name on it; to use Dave’s words, “make a new format as an
evolution”.  Thus,
<a href="http://intertwingly.net/wiki/pie">Atom</a>.
We don’t have to agree about everything, but if the Internet depends on
anything, it depends on standards that are stable, and the framework of trust
around that stability.</p>

<title>WS-Angst</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There’s been an interesting flurry of high-level WS-discussion,
launched by Don Box in 
<a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2006/02/17/18869.aspx">Pragmatics</a>
(it’s short, go read it, the long string of comments doesn’t add much).
The discussion sloshed around the blogosphere; I’ll pick some highlights.
Stefan Tilkov
<a href="http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/2006/02/18/here_we_go_again_soap_vs_rest.html">says
Mu</a>: “I do believe that on a very high level, the debate is utterly
irrelevant.”  I don’t.  I just don’t believe that there’s a level high enough
that large-scale basic infrastructure bets don’t matter.
Chris Ferris
<a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/dw_blog_comments.jspa?blog=440&amp;entry=108502">offers
conventional wisdom</a>: WS-* is just fine, taking a little longer than we’d
hoped, but you’re really gonna need this stuff.
Patrick Logan
<a href="http://patricklogan.blogspot.com/2006/02/rest-and-soap.html">pushes
back</a>: “I was shocked how little interoperability, not to mention
functionality, has been accomplished in the WSDL and SOAP world over the last
several years ... we decided to run a different experiment... address the
same business problem but with just HTTP. Very soon we were spending all our
time talking about business functionality and messages rather than
infrastructure headaches.”  Ooh.
Dare Obasanjo weighs in twice:
<a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=ca19f6b9-8afd-4e93-b4f6-8c3beee8d088">More on Pragmatism and Web Services</a>,
and especially
<a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=63195673-70e6-438c-9465-2a22e1812789">Why
WS-* interop sucks</a>.
I’ll leave the last word to Rob Sayre in
<a href="http://www.franklinmint.fm/blog/archives/000649.html">No, It’s Over,
I Really Mean It</a>: “If you have Microsoft saying ‘well, the best approach
is to make this elaborate infrastructure we’ve spent billions of dollars
building out optional’, then the debate is over.”
Me, I think the WS-stench of something WS-rotting from the WS-head down is
becoming increasingly difficult to ignore.</p>

<title>Koyaanisqatsi</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>From time to time,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Glass">Phil Glass</a> goes out on
tour with his ensemble, playing the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koyaanisqatsi">Koyaanisqatsi</a>
soundtrack live in front of the movie.  We went to the show this
evening and really enjoyed it.
The movie ages reasonably well (although the actual physical print was a
little tired), with the exception of the over-long,
over-excited, un-subtle <cite>The Grid</cite> segment in the middle.
I find I can route around the ham-handed industrial-civilization-sucks
message and enjoy the elegant very slow cuts—yes, look at this mountain (or
machine, or cloudscape, or unglamorous middle-aged face) for much longer
than you thought you wanted to and realise that there’s more there to see than
you thought.  And there’s a message in that too, about time and attention, that
seems more important to me than the other.
As for the music, Philip Glass may not be 
exactly mainstream, but he’s not controversial any more.
I have a bunch of his albums and think that both <cite>Glassworks</cite> and
<cite>Mishima</cite> have some 5-✭ tracks.
The band plays beautifully (5 keyboards, 3 woodwinds, one soprano and some of
the instrumentalists sing too); Phil doesn’t conduct but gets to play the
juicy low slow atmospherics.  The sound was clean and pure and solid, too.
I really enjoyed the crowd, the last couple of times we’d been at that venue
it was for the opera, and the Phil Glass crowd was funkier, better dressed
(not more expensively, better), and (dare I say it) looked
more intelligent.</p>

<title>FSS: Cypress Hills Again</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Friday Slide Scan #24 is a shot that should have appeared in
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/03/04/FSS">FSS #6: Cypress Hills</a>; it
caught my eye when I was going through the files and it is, if you like the
Prairies, just too pretty to skip.
As a bonus, there’s a Prairie story of jailbreak and highway terror.</p>
<img src="1541.jpg" alt="Prairie Fence in Cypress Hills Interprovincial Park" />
<p>I suppose I should, as with that other picture, plug
<a href="http://www.cypresshills.com/">Cypress Hills Interprovincial
Park</a> on the Alberta-Saskatchewan border, a wonderful place.
Now, here’s that story.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Jailbreak</h2>
<p>One time I was driving somewhere around here, heading east from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary">Calgary</a> to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regina%2C_Saskatchewan">Regina</a>.
It was the middle of some quiet weekday, hardly anyone on the road, nobody at
all for lengthy stretches, then all of a sudden there was a police car behind
me, lights flashing.
I don’t know where the hell he’d been hiding, in that country you can see a
gopher a half-day’s walk away.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCMP">Mountie</a> smiled through my
open window and politely suggested I’d
been speeding.  Well, no turns, no hills, no other cars, and another
500km to Regina, of course I was bloody speeding.  He asked me to come sit in 
his cruiser while he wrote it up.  Once we got comfy he asked “Seen a black
Ford camper on the road recently?”  Well, I’d probably only seen ten cars in
the previous hour so I gave it some thought and told him I was pretty sure I
hadn’t. 
Unusually for a cop, he gave me the back story.</p>
<p>This really bad guy in jail in Calgary had
told all his buddies that he was going to break out, steal a gun, steal a car,
go to the town in Saskatchewan where his wife lived, and kill her, because she
done him wrong.
Sure enough, he’d broken out of jail, held up a gun store in broad daylight,
ripped a black Ford camper off the dealership across the street, and vanished.
I imagine that there were nervous policemen on pretty well every fifty feet of
road between there and his wife’s town, and I certainly hope she’d been 
hastily moved somewhere else.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the Mountie seemed like a nice guy; he fined me a whole lot less
than he could have, and sent me on my way.
Half an hour later I came over the edge of those long slow Prairie hills, and
not too far in front of me was a black camper being followed pretty close by a
patrol car, both going pretty slow.
Well, I started going pretty slow too; I didn’t want to be passing
them when a hail of gunfire broke out.</p>
<p>But the cop pulled out and drove away (there are lots of black Ford
campers in that part of the world); then the driver, no doubt puzzled at why
there were so many cops checking him out, picked up speed too and left me
behind.</p>
<p>Images in the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1953
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>,

Bray, and

exactly who took one, I’ll say; in this case, Tim Bray.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using
a Nikon CoolScan 4000 ED scanner and cleaned up by a combination of the Nikon
scanning software and PhotoShop Elements.</p>

<title>NetBeans RFEs</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>What happened was, I got coder’s block; facing an icky part of my
Sigrid/Zeppelin side-project, I procrastinated for weeks
because all of a sudden everything else became more interesting.  Well, I’m
supposed to talk about it at
<a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/">Java One</a> and I’ve refactored
large parts of it to 
the point where it doesn’t work any more.  So I’ve increasingly been spending 
my time slaving over a hot NetBeans 5.0.  There is absolutely no
better way to find out the truth about software than actually using it to get
real work done.  Note: I’m doing all-POJO low-level infrastructure, so I don’t
know the first thing about JSF’s and Layouts and Web Services and all that
stuff.  Having said that, for what I’m doing, NB5.0 is <em>fucking good
software</em>.  Among other things, it’s really really fast on my PowerBook,
and
<a href="http://www.redmonk.com/sogrady/archives/001324.html">speed is a
feature</a> (although to get the most out of it you need a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/06/02/Big-Screen-NetBeans">bigger
screen</a>).
Yes, the Ultra 20 is faster on compiles, but I’m having trouble getting it on
VPN so it can talk to CVS, and for interactive on-screen work, the difference
isn’t significant.
Anyhow, I’m keeping a running RFE list; for those not in the
software biz, that stands for Request For Enhancement; they arise when a
customer says “Your stupid software is broken, it should do X” and some
hard-ass manager with his eye on the ship date says “That’s not a bug, it’s an RFE.”
If I were a Good
NetBeans Citizen I would go find the right web forms and submit bugs and
RFEs and so on, and maybe I will.  But right now I’m in a hurry and
(muahahaha) <em>I’m a blogger!</em>  So I’ll just use this post as a place to
track ’em.
The rest of this is only of interest to IDE interface geeks and NetBeans
phanatics.</p>
<h3 id='p-2'>No Green JUnit Bar</h3>
<p>I’m quite sure that 40 years from now I’ll be sitting in an old-folks’ home
in a warm climate somewhere, sipping a gin-and-tonic and whining about how
NetBeans still doesn’t do the green bar.</p>
<h3 id='p-3'>Keymapping</h3>
<p>Near as I can tell, you can map pretty well anything NetBeans does to
pretty well any key.
Suppose, just for example, that I wanted to map “Move Down” to control-N (yes,
I know about the Emacs keymappings, but I don’t want that, I just want a bit
of Emacs salt-and-pepper on the defaults).  You get a screen that looks like
this:</p>
<img src="Keymap.png" alt="NetBeans keymap customization dialogue" />
<p>Where, do you suppose, you might find “Move Down” in here?  Good luck,
you’ll need it.
I always end up going through all the sub-menus one by one by one, swearing
louder and louder; it turns out that in this case, what I’m looking for is
under “Other” and rejoices in the name “Insertion Point Down”.
Feh.  I’m not sure what the solution is.</p>
<h3 id='p-4'>Find Usages</h3>
<p>You’ve got your cursor in some method declaration and you hit the key for
“Find Usages”.  Does it go and find the usages?  No, it does not; it puts up a
dialogue like this:</p>
<img src="FindUsages.png" alt="NetBeans 'Find Usages' dialogue" />
<p>Surely “Search in Comments” is a preference?  And why a tick-box for Find
Usages when I’ve just said that’s what I want to do?  This dialogue 
should be junked, just go and find the damn usages already.</p>
<h3 id='p-5'>Auto-Completion</h3>
<p>I haven’t used Eclipse or Idea or Visual Studio recently, so I’m not really
aware of the competitive standards, but NetBeans’ auto-complete feels really
excellent to me, maybe because the 5.0 version is better than the 4.* version
which was better than the 3.6 version where I started.  It usually gives me
more or less exactly what I need.
Having said that, there’s one enhancement I’d like and one egregious botch
that needs fixing.</p>
<p>The enhancement is this: sometimes the suggestion list is too long, and I’d
like it to be shorter.  Most of the time, I find that I’m calling methods from
the package I’m in, or the project I’m in, or one of the projects I have
open.  Let’s call those methods “Local methods”.  How about, when I type
auto-complete, all it suggests are local methods; and if I want the whole list
including java.foo.bar.baz.*, I hit the auto-complete key
<em>again</em>; of course, if there’s nothing local to suggest when I hit
auto-complete the first time, it could go to the big list.</p>
<p>Here’s the botch: suppose I type<br/>
<code>MessageBuilder mb = new</code><br/>
and hit the auto-complete key.  NetBeans says “No suggestions”.  Do ya think I
might just possibly want a <code>new MessageBuilder()</code>, just maybe?
If I take it a few more keys:<br/>
<code>MessageBuilder mb = new Message</code><br/>
the auto-complete shows me everything in the bloody Java universe that begins
with <code>Message</code>, of which there’s quite a bit.  There’s even quite a
bit that begins with <code>MessageB</code>.
The right thing to do is obvious, I’d think.</p>
<h3 id='p-1'>Brackets and Semicolons</h3>
<p>Suppose I type:<br/>
<code>foo = frob(new Bar(3 + baz(27</code><br/>
NetBeans will helpfully fill in the end-brackets so what I see on the screen
is:<br/>
<code>foo = frob(new Bar(3 + baz(27)))</code><br/>
with my cursor after the 27.  Then if I type ‘;’ NetBeans hops over the
closing braces before inserting it and I’m left with a nicely-completed
statement.</p>
<p>Now, if I type
<code>foo = frob(new Bar(3 + baz(xyzzy[27</code><br/>
the same thing happens, NetBeans shows me<br/>
<code>foo = frob(new Bar(3 + baz(xyzzy[27])))</code><br/>
<em>But</em>, if I now type ‘;’ it gets left inside the square brackets,
which are treated differently from round brackets.  Boo.  Hiss.</p>
<h3 id='p-6'>Quotes in Comments</h3>
<p>When you type a single or double quote, NetBeans helpfully puts in two,
just like it does with brackets.
<i>Even when you’re in a comment.</i>  So if you’re writing the Javadocs and
want to 
be helpful and say “Don’t call this unless...”, well you can figure it out.
This one may just be a buglet, because I think it didn’t used to do this.</p>
<h2 id='p-8'>Chatty</h2>
<p>When I hit F9 for “compile this file” I see:</p>
<pre><code>init:
deps-jar:
init:
deps-jar:
compile:
<span style="color:red">To run this application from the command line without Ant, try:

<p>I sure enjoyed them; ski-ing and bobsledding and, well, anything run
against the clock gets old pretty fast, but the hockey and curling and
speed-skating are good entertainment, especially that short-track stuff.
Our women hockey players were hot stuff; there was the cutest picture
of big star Hayley Wickenheiser with her gold medal looped around the neck
of her little kid; how come you never see pictures of the men like that?
I thought the opening and closing ceremonies both made excellent TV, 
even though the over-wrought Renaissance costume-drama bits
really didn’t do much for me.  
I thought the short Vancouver segment at the closing hit the
spot OK; there are probably a hundred million people now who think Canada is
native elders, circus acrobats, and Avril Lavigne.  You could do worse, I
suppose.  But you have
to hand it to Vancouver mayor Sam Sullivan, a quadriplegic, who pulled off a
nice extended wave of the big Olympic flag with some deft wheelchair
rotations.
Watch for me in the crowd in 2010.</p>

<title>Storytelling</title>

<p>Recently,
<a href="http://pomosprachspielen.blogspot.com/">Postmodern Sass</a> wrote
<a href="http://pomosprachspielen.blogspot.com/2006/02/ich-bin-kein-blogger.html">Ich bin kein Blogger</a>,
calling out an argument that there is no such thing as blogging.
I think the evidence is against her, but then again, Sass herself
has been doing something with the form that I haven’t seen anywhere else.
Her blog is filled with extended, interlinked, multi-part stories; nothing new
about that.  But every time she posts a story, she goes back to the previous
episode and updates it to add an “in the next chapter...” link.  Latch onto a
few of the stories in her 
<a href="http://pomosprachspielen.blogspot.com/2005_09_01_pomosprachspielen_archive.html">Year
One Archives</a> and see how they run backward and forward.
I think this is
a good idea and quite a few of the multi-part blog narratives out there,
including some of my own series, would have benefited from richer
linkage.</p>

<title>5✭♫: Pale Sun, Crescent Moon</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Three tracks from this 1993 album by the
<a href="http://www.cowboyjunkies.com/">Cowboy Junkies</a> earned five stars,
pretty good for pop music.
Plus there’s one from <cite>The Trinity Sessions</cite>, but let’s leave that
for later.
There are a lot of Cowboy Junkies albums, and they’re all good as far as I
know; I find myself ashamed that I haven’t bought any for a decade or so, so
I’ll fix that Real Soon Now.  Read on for an appreciation of good songs, good
singing, good playing, and good words.
<i>(“5✭♫” series introduction <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music">here</a>;
with <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music#p-1">an
explanation</a> of why the title may look broken.)</i></p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Context</h2><p>Some lyrics:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>I heard a man in a crisis falls back on what he knows
best<br/> 
a murderer to murder, a thief to theft<br/>
and I don’t want you to think that this is some kind of deathbed confession<br/>
but running’s what I do, when put to the test.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>That’s from <cite>First Recollection</cite>, one of those five-star tracks,
and establishes that the CJs’
music tends to be kind of sad and has lyrics that are worth listening
to.</p>
<p>I remember like yesterday when they suddenly got noticed in 1988, with
<cite>The Trinity Sessions</cite>, a record that all of a
sudden had a bunch of blues lovers, romantics, and
audiophiles pointing in the same direction.</p>
<p>I listened to that CD more than anybody ought to listen to anything, but
how could you not?  The songs had wonderful tunes and naked heart-to-heart
lyrics sung beautifully with a ton of feeling.  And masterful playing,
especially that moaning, snarling guitar.  Plus incredibly clear, honest,
detailed, caressing audiophile sound.</p>
<p>Here’s an excerpt from a piece I wrote in 1990 or so for
<a href="http://www.theabsolutesound.com/">The Absolute Sound</a>, the
ultimate obsessive high-end audio magazine.  I had a short-lived gig with
them around then, writing about live music, the ideal which all that
high-priced hardware usually miserably fails to capture.
The piece was about a concert (in 1991 I think) at the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Place#Former_attractions_and_venues">Ontario Place forum</a>,
which Wikipedia tells me no longer exists.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Cowboy Junkies are an odd case.
Their approach, in the beginning, was risky in the extreme—minimal miking, sad
songs played slow. 
But so many people liked it that it's become a straitjacket for the band,
one they've struggled with only limited success to escape from.
Aside from the lovely <cite>Trinity Sessions</cite>, their only
other really memorable record is the first, <cite>Whites Off Earth
Now</cite>.</p>
<p>I hadn't seen the CJs before, and I found it pretty
safe, nothing to write home about.
This may seem picky—the songs were beautiful, Margo Timmins’
voice could melt stone, the band is really tight, the whole evening was
very pleasant.
And only pleasant, until they played <cite>Sweet Jane</cite>.
I've always had a soft spot for that tune, and on that
night, for that song, somehow it all got serious.
The band made space between the notes for deep wells of silence.
Margo sounded like her heart <em>would</em> break.
Unusually for her, she reached back for more, and then for
more again, on the wordless vocal bridge—she and the audience
seemed at one, deeply moved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Margo” is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margo_Timmins">Margo Timmins</a>, who
sings and has two brothers in the band.
Of course, they proved me wrong by making lots of great records after
that.</p>
<img src="Pale-Sun-Crescent-Moon.png" class="inline" alt="Pale Sun, Crescent Moon, by the Cowboy Junkies" />
<h2 id='p-2'>The Music</h2>
<p>All the songs on this record are good.  I’ve written about
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/01/31/Cold%20Tea%20Blues">Cold Tea Blues</a>,
one of the earliest pieces here at <span class='o'>ongoing</span>.
<cite>First Recollection</cite> has those scary lyrics, and behind Margo’s
heavenly melodies, some orchestral guitar rumble that any hair-band axeman
would be proud of if he could play them, which most couldn’t.
<cite>Ring on the Sill</cite> has some melodic turns that would be a Top
Forty hit in the hands of any number of manufactured-for-the-season
<i>idoru</i>, but then goes on to rip up your heartstrings in some other
directions.
<cite>Pale Sun</cite> is a lament about the Deep Southwest and its rusting
cars and crumbling, betrayed, aboriginal people; but there’s a note of hope in
the lovely melody and the words too.</p>
<p>Then there’s <cite>Floorboard Blues</cite>, which probably deserves five
stars for evoking a fear I’ve heard in the conversation of a hundred different
women, but has a happy ending, and along the way says:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>He’ll be slicing tiny crescents from your heart<br/>
without laying that sweaty palm on your cheek.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>And did I mention that the electric guitar playing is outstanding?
And the sound
quality is about as good as there is?  If you listen to this record (or any of
the band’s really) on a high-end system, it will put you in danger of
developing a really expensive habit.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Sampling It</h2>
<p>It’s everywhere.  In this case, I feel that it would be morally OK for me
to recommend that you go pirate a few of the tracks, because if you have any
musical taste or ethics, you’re going to end up buying a few discs.  So why
not save time and just go pick up <cite>Pale Sun, Crescent Moon</cite>?

<p>Feb. 27, 2003 saw the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/02/27/Hello">Hello world</a> post here at
<span class='o'>ongoing</span>.
Three years?  Seems like thirty.  This, when I post it, will be fragment number
one thousand seven hundred and sixty-two.  I’d calculate the word-count, but
that would take some real work, and my time in front of a computer is full,
full with things I want to work 
on and <span class='o'>ongoing</span> fragments I want to write.
Thanks, 1,762 thanks, for reading, and to my co-workers and family,

<title>Hi-Fi?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I gather that on stage today, Mr. Jobs freely flung about the word
“audiophile” while pitching the new
<a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodhifi/">iPod Hi-Fi</a>.
Well, I’m one of those: wrote for the mags, have gear from obscure British
manufacturers, turn off a fridge thirty feet away to listen.  I’ll look
forward to giving the Hi-Fi a listen.  It seems fantastically dubious that
something 43 cm wide, with a listed bass floor of 53Hz (the bottom string
on a bass is 42Hz), weighing 6.6kg, and costing $349, could actually produce
“audiophile” sound.  But you know, it’s not impossible; if they design for
truth and accuracy as opposed to fake-bass thump and scary volume, it could
turn out to be pretty useful.
In which case, it’d be a complete waste to play your average
iTunes-store-sourced lo-rez lossy-compressed MP3 through it.
But you <em>can</em> get audiophile sound out of your iPod, and for quite a
bit less than $349.
Go out and buy one of the good in-ear headphones from Etymotics or one of
their competitors (I use the Shure 3C) and, most important of all, get your
music off CDs and use lossless compression.  The D/A in an iPod is
really not bad at all; if you send all of the music through it and play it
through first-class transducers, you’ll be happy.
(By the way, is it just me or is this thing butt-ugly?)</p>

<p>If you follow Jonathan Schwartz, you will have observed a
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan?entry=niagara_free_trial_update">little flurry
around our offer</a> of free-trial (and maybe free-for-keeps) T2000 servers.
If you read the comments, it’s become apparent that our systems for supporting
this kind of marketing promotion, uh, need some work.
I’m really glad that Jonathan did this, because I know from bitter experience
how bad we are at offering hardware freebies, and this will force us to fix
it.
Particularly right at the
moment, it seems to me a no-brainer that scattering a few of our Opteron
and Niagara boxes in the direction of some worthy OSS projects and startup
companies would be about the most cost-effective marketing imaginable.
On lots of occasions I’ve gone running excitedly to the product groups saying
“Hey, it would be really great if we could get XXX a server to try out!” and
the reaction is along the lines of “Well yeah, but how would we do that?”
It turns out that when you’re a big public company, if you have a defined
process in place for doing something, it’s easy and efficient, and if you
don’t, you’re in SNAFU territory.
Lots of other good stuff in those comments too, check them out.
In particular, I happen to know that Wikipedia already has one of
the free-trial T2000 boxes, and that’s a <em>very</em> interesting
application, so we’re going to work with them see how fast we can make it
run on that box.  Sun is full of Wikipedia fans.</p>

<title>The Analysts and the Elephant</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>In recent weeks there’s been a lot of talk about the role of analyst
firms.
Let’s be honest; the way the business works, pretty much nobody <em>likes</em>
these organizations, but many (including me) think they’re necessary, and since
Gartner is closing in on a billion dollars a year of revenue, they’re
obviously selling something that people will buy.
Herewith a survey of the discussion, some personal anecdotes about the
relationships between vendors and analysts, and some thoughts on the
future.</p>
<p>What happened was, earlier in February there was a fairly hard-edged
<a href="http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=178601879">story
in Information Week</a>, highlighting “the appearance of a conflict of interest”.
Then in mid-month, The Register gave
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/02/17/itanic_oracle_idc/">a pretty
severe thrashing</a> to an IDC Itanium market study.
That day, in a footnote to
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan">his Ning post</a> (search
down for “register”), Jonathan Schwartz pointed to both those pieces,
remarking “it'd probably help their credibility if they, like the financial
analyst community, started disclosing revenues they receive from the vendors
they cover”.
Strong stuff.
Finally, James Governor wrote a big, intense piece entitled
<a href="http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/archives/001320.html">Why Open
Source Analysis Will Grow: Learning from The Sumerians</a> saying, among other
things, “Gartner is like a mainframe in 1979. Ripe for deconstruction.”
(Oh, and relatedly, I recently ran across the quite decent
<a href="http://www.bloglines.com/blog/GartnerWatch">Gartner Watch</a> blog.)</p>
<p>But it occurs to me that none of these pieces come right out and point to
the elephant in the room.  Here it is:</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Are Analysts Corrupt?</h2>
<p>It is believed by many in the industry that if you’re
a vendor and become the customer of one of these companies, then they’ll say
nice things about you.  The more money you give them, the story goes, the
nicer the things you’ll say.</p>
<p>How do I know people believe this?  
Because when I was a bright young entrepreneur doing
my first start-up, that’s what the grizzled industry veterans told me; and
they weren’t subtle: “You gotta sign up with Jupiter or Meta or someone and
pay them big bucks to advise you, more than you think you can afford, then
they’ll write reports saying you’re great, which nobody actually reads, but
that’s OK, you can hand them out at sales calls and prospects will be
impressed”.</p> 
<p>Well, I have some personal experience.  On three different occasions 
I got to make the call as to whether a startup signed up with an
analyst firm.  
Twice, I decided it was too expensive.  Once, I did it because my VCs
told me I had to.</p>
<p>The two times I refused to sign up, I managed to get us covered and
mentioned favorably in the analyst white-papers anyhow.  In the third case, we
paid a whole lot of money, didn’t get much useful advice, and the analysis
they wrote was lame.</p>
<p>So my personal experience would suggest that corruption at least isn’t
universal, and furthermore, to the extent that it exists, it doesn’t work very
well.</p>
<p>I will say that I have seen analyst white-papers 
with billows of glowing prose about companies that I knew
pretty well and was convinced were obvious no-hopers.
I don’t know if that coverage was bought and paid for, but I wouldn’t be that
shocked if that was the story.
On the other hand, I’ve been wrong, have written companies off as obvious
bozos, then they’ve gone on to fame and fortune.</p>
<p>The perception of corruption, whether it’s true or not, hasn’t gone away. 
Shortly after I joined Sun, I was trying to figure out why large parts of the
industry seemed hell-bent on re-creating CORBA, only more complex and less
efficient, under the WS-* banner.  One senior technology strategist, not from
Sun, told me “Obvious!  It’s because IBM and Microsoft paid the analysts
megabucks, <em>megabucks I tell you</em>, to go out and tell everyone that
this was where the future was, and anyone who wasn’t going that way was dog
meat.”  Mind you, he’d had a few beers.  But that’s not the only time I’ve heard
that particular suggestion.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>What Do I Think?</h2>
<p>I really don’t know.  The one time I did sign up with an analyst firm, it
was made clear that the package did include writing about us.  They didn’t
say, and I didn’t ask, how much we could influence what they wrote.
I do believe that there is the <em>potential</em> for corruption, and that
every group of ten people or more contains someone corruptible.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I know analysts, and the ones that I know are by and
large pretty smart and pretty nice and hard-working and in my direct personal
experience, they’ve given me good coverage when I deserved it, and ignored me
when my story was weak.</p>
<p>Also: <em>Never ascribe to malice that which can be explained by
stupidity</em>, and I mean collective stupidity.
Our profession has a history of galloping <i>en masse</i> off
in really bad directions (Ada, AI, OODBMS, there are more examples).
So you don’t have to believe in mass corruption even if you think, as I do,
that the analysts are mostly wrong about WS-*.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>It’s a Problem</h2>
<p>It’s a problem for the analysts, and their customers, and for the industry, 
that there’s this elephant in the room.
Because I totally believe that we need analysts.  I know for a
fact that there are those who read people like me and
<a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/">Don Box</a> and 
<a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/dw_blog.jspa?blog=384">Bob Sutor</a>
and use what we say about Java or messaging stacks or ODF as serious 
business input.
But dammit, we’re vendors, our paychecks depend on selling you expensive stuff!
At least with us, our hearts are on our sleeves and the conflict of interest is
screamingly obvious.</p>
<p>It seems that in a rational world, there’d be a place for professional
intermediaries; someone who has a 
non-tech business to run doesn’t really have time to
drill down on whether crazies like me who are dissing WS-* are right or wrong.
They should be able to outsource that research.  (By the way, no analyst from
a mainstream firm has ever raised the WS-* issue with me, which seems
a little weird).</p>
<p>If the analysts were paid entirely by technology <em>buyers</em>, the
elephant would just go away; but that doesn’t seem likely.
No, I don’t know the solution, but now at least you know about the large
invisible object in the room with peanuts on its breath, the one that
the people writing about the analyst industry are dancing around.</p>

<title>Totem Thunder</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Early this year, I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/01/Velodyne-MiniVee">reconfigured the
video setup</a>, among other things adding a little Velodyne “MiniVee”
subwoofer that worked really well, but made me think that perhaps the big
Serious Music system could benefit from subwoofer love.  So I added a
<a href="http://totemacoustic.com/english/products/subwoofer_thunder.htm">Totem
Thunder</a>;
herewith an unashamedly
sicko-audiophile (but quantitative, with measurements) fragment that obsesses
about music in general and Really Low Frequencies in particular; with a
side-trip to a church in Paris.
I’ll provide some introductory material in hopes of maybe luring innocent
readers into this obsessive and expensive hobby.</p> 
<h2 id='p-1'>Cause and Effect</h2>
<p>It became apparent to me that the new subwoofer in the TV 
system (a cute little thing, no more than a foot in any dimension) was playing
some notes that were lower than the big pure-audio system in another part of
the house could go.
Once I heard them, this was unacceptable.</p>
<p>Leaping ahead to the conclusion: With the Thunder in place, the big system
can go lower, which is nice, although there really isn’t that much music that
reaches that low-most people have never actually heard a musical note much
below 40Hz.  But the good news is that the subwoofer helps out 
the whole system; I can hear it and I measured it just to be sure; read
on.</p>
<img src="Forest.png" alt="Totem Forest speaker" class="inline" />
<h2 id='p-3'>History</h2>
<p>My main speakers, for the last four years or so, have been a pair of 
<a href="http://totemacoustic.com/english/">Totem Acoustic</a> Forest
floor-standers. 
Although the system has changed a bit over the years, I’ve only ever had Totem
speakers in it since about 1990.  
I heard the original Totem Model One at an audio show in
Toronto many many years ago, playing some Purcell string suite, and fell
instantly in love.  I’d still be using the Model Ones except for our living
room is large-ish, and when I played big orchestral pieces at high volume
(much harder on the system than most rock &amp; roll), things were sounding
kind of stressed.
I basically wanted the same sound, but more of it; thus the Forests.</p>
<p>I could go on about the sound of the Forests, but I think I’ll outsource
that; have a look at the
<a href="http://www.stereophile.com/loudspeakerreviews/378/index.html">extended 
discussion</a> of the speaker from <cite>Stereophile</cite>, one of the Big
Two audiophile magazines.
I think that piece is a good introduction to audiophile culture.  First, Larry
Greenhill 
goes on for some pages, discussing various aspects of the speakers’ sound as
illustrated by specific musical recordings; praising some things and
criticizing others.
Then, John Atkinson runs some careful quantitative tests on the speaker,
producing a couple of graph-laden pages.</p>
<p>Both these parts are from 2001.  Then, there’s a follow-up piece by
Atkinson from 2005; no more tests, just listening.</p>
<p>The conclusion is consistent; the Forest listens and measures well, but the
bass extension is kind of limited.  Atkinson reports that filling the bottom
of the speaker with sand (it has a compartment for this purpose) really
improves things.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>High-End Business Practices</h2>
<p>So I sent an email to the contact address on the Totem website, wondering
what they’d suggest; I got a “we’re on vacation, next week” auto-reply, and
sure enough, they responded the next Monday,
recommending their Thunder and Storm subwoofers as good matches for the Forests,
and attached a list of the local dealers.</p>
<img src="Thunder.png" alt="Totem Thunder subwoofer" class="inline" />
<p>I was so impressed by the little Velodyne I’d bought that I was going to
check their products out too, but what happened was, I was on another errand
that took me by one of the dealers and so I stopped in.  The dealer looked
like they weren’t doing that well, the place was a bit run-down and
disorganized.  When I mentioned that I was thinking about the Totem subwoofers,
the guy pointed me at a floor model of the Thunder, in apparently perfect
condition, and 
offered me a terrific deal—I’d checked prices so I knew.  Anyhow, I ended up
taking it home, albeit without the original packaging or manual
(yes, the dealer was hurting I think).</p>
<p>So when I got home I emailed Totem and asked if they had an electronic
version of the manual, and there was a Word document in my in-basket a couple
of hours later, along with notes on how they recommended setting up the
Thunder to work with the Forests.
The manual revealed that the Thunder was supposed to come with feet, only mine
hadn’t. 
I mentioned this in my thank-you note to Totem and
went downtown to shout at the dealer, who couldn’t find them, but said they’d see what they could
do.</p>
<p>By the time I got home there was another email from Totem saying the dealer
had contacted them about me, what was my address, they’d just send some new
feet along.  Is that service or what?  The high end is like that.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>The Sound</h2>
<p>Of course, I had to start with low-bass showpieces, of which there aren’t
that many.  The bottom string on a bass guitar or fiddle is 42Hz, which is
pretty darn low, and there’s really not that much music that goes south of
there. 
One exception is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enya">Enya</a>; the opening title track
from her 1988 
<cite>Watermark</cite> album has some very low synthesizer, and track 10,
<cite>The Longships</cite>, has the most musically intelligent ultralow sounds
I’ve ever heard, monstrous strokes on a huge bass drum, 
they shudder the air and are still sweetly melodic.  If you’ve heard this song
on ordinary speakers, they just omit the big drum and it still sounds OK, but
the whole song falls into place, musically, once the foundation is there.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>A Church in Paris</h2>
<p>My other showpiece is <cite>The Great Organ of St. Eustache</cite>, (Dorian
053479013422, 1993), featuring Jean Guillou.
By the way, if you’re a music lover and find yourself in Paris on any Sunday,
do yourself a favor and visit
<a href="http://www.saint-eustache.org/">Saint Eustache</a>, right in the
middle of town, it’s a nice church and the organ is one of the world’s
greatest, and there’s regularly free music to listen to.</p>
<img src="Great-Organ.png" alt="The Great Organ of Saint-Eustache church, Paris" />
<p>That organ is by Van den Heuvel, and it
<a href="http://vandenheuvel-orgelbouw.nl/instruments/eustache/Frameset_eustache.htm">has
its own website</a>, check it out, really.  
The titular organist is Jean Guillou, and I’m a big fan; he’s done lots of
recordings, some on much smaller instruments, and he’s got lots of nuance and
grace.  But when he points the big iron at a meaty piece of Bach or
Liszt or Franck, it feels like someone’s reaching in and squeezing your
pancreas, in a nice sort of way.</p>
<p>On that Dorian recording, some of the music is more interesting than others
(Guillou is a better performer than composer) but my favorite is Liszt’s
<cite>Fantasy and Fugue on the Name B-A-C-H</cite>.
Crank this up on a good system and it’s real easy to frighten yourself.
The Saint-Eustache organ has <em>three</em> different 32' bass stops
and you really can’t begin to imagine what it sounds like there in the church.
The Thunder takes you a small part of the way there, and even that’s pretty
mind-boggling.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>Thrilling the Kid</h2>
<p>I was home alone with the six-year-old when I was setting up the Thunder,
so I called him over and said “listen to this” and played the Enya and Liszt
tracks.  He literally jumped up and down with glee, grinning from ear to
ear.  I’ll make an audiophile of the boy yet.</p>
<h2 id='p-8'>Ordinary Music</h2>
<p>Just like the little Velodyne, the Thunder has a circuit that turns it on
automatically a few seconds after music starts playing.
I noticed that when it
kicked in, the low bass didn’t change very much, but the whole thing
sounded... better.</p> 
<p>I haven’t figured it out yet, but something good is happening.  To start
with, I think that even though the sub is being rolled off about 60Hz, it’s
filling in enough sound that both the main amplifier and the Forests are
working less hard and running a little easier.  Also, as I said, it’s a
biggish room, and maybe there’s some synergy there.
Anyhow, the net effect is that I’ve been sitting up late recently,
listening to one piece of music after another, without really thinking much
about frequency ranges.
Some disks that have sounded particularly excellent on recent
evenings are the James Gang’s <cite>Rides Again</cite> (on LP), Miles
Davis’ <cite>Ascenseur Pour L'Echafaud</cite>, and Rickie Lee Jones’ <cite>Pop
Pop</cite>.  That last one has some surprising string-bass parts; the
other two have nothing special in the low notes, but they still sound better,
go figure.</p> 
<p>I love this hobby; you get to geek out and buy
beautiful objects, and the reward is music.</p>
<h2 id='p-10'>Measuring</h2>
<p>I may be a deranged audiophile but I’m also an engineer dammit, so I
decided to break out the measuring gear, which in this case is a basic Radio
Shack SPL meter, they’re under $50 and are remarkably accurate for the money.  
The ones they sell
now have a digital readout, but mine is ten years old and has a funky analogue
needle that’s fun to watch.</p>
<p>It turns out that you can get test CDs to help with this.  The one I use is
from <cite>Stereophile</cite>, yes, the magazine, and it has some first-rate
music on it along with the test tracks.
Among the test tracks are 30 or so “warble-tone” tracks that cover the whole
audible spectrum, from 20Hz to 20KHz.
(Both those extremes are kind of nominal, you can’t actually <em>hear</em>
20Hz so much as feel a rumble in your chest, and my middle-aged ears only go
up to about 15KHz).
So what you do is you put the SPL-meter on a camera tripod at the listening
position, play the first warble tone and fiddle with the volume and
sensitivity to get it at zero dB, then run through all the warble tones and
watch the needle.</p>
<img src="Thunder-Controls.png" alt="Totem Thunder subwoofer controls" class="inline" />
<p>With the Thunder in the system, after I’d fine-tuned its level control based
on a couple of runs, the measurements were
<em>outstanding</em>. At the listening position, 
it was very flat from 1000Hz down to 31Hz, typically ±2dB, with one or two
little excursions to ±3.  20Hz was
at -6dB, and then the high frequencies, from 1000Hz or so up to the top, were
evenly depressed, -4dB to -6dB all the way across.
These are very good numbers for a home-audio in-room real-world
scenario.</p>
<h2 id='p-9'>Velodyne?</h2>
<p>The Thunder’s controls are illustrated there to your right, and are pretty
easy to figure out.  They’re remarkably like the those on the
<a href="http://www.velodyne.com/velodyne/products/product.aspx?ID=14&amp;sid=447n340d">MiniVee</a>
in the video system.</p>
<p>The Thunder has a circuit just like the Velodyne’s where it detects a
signal and wakes from sleep.  There’s this clever blue LED on
the back where you can’t see it, and when the Thunder wakes up it projects an
elegant small soft blue circle on the wall behind it.  The MiniVee has a blue
LED on the front for this same purpose, the exact same colour.</p>
<p>Both subs sometimes require that you briefly crank the volume a little
higher than you might like it, to wake them up. The amount of crankage
required “feels” really similar, like exactly the same.
Both stay on for a few minutes after the music stops, so you usually only
have to do this once per evening.</p>
<p>So I suspect that the Thunder actually includes
some Velodyne technology.  The cabinetry is distinctively Totem, and I
assume they’ve done some work on the drivers.
This wouldn’t be surprising, there’s lots of rebranding and
rebadging that goes on in the high-end world.  Among other things, a subwoofer
has to include an amplifier, and Totem doesn’t make those—their core
competence is drivers and cabinets—so it would make sense for them to have
outsourced that.</p>
<h2 id='p-11'>Smiles</h2>
<p>Anyhow, this has been a successful little project; if you’re a music lover,
consider giving audiophilia a try.  It’s less expensive than gambling,
substance abuse, or philandering, and should thus rank pretty low among the
vices.
Now I’m wondering where to go to get sand and lead shot, suitable for
ballasting the Forests.  I’ll report on how it goes.</p>

cost me an unplanned hour while the rest of the family slept, on
the subject of programming languages.  If you care about such things, stop
reading here or you’re about to get stuck too; but that’s because it’s good
stuff.  Bill pointed me at
<a href="http://opal.cabochon.com/~stevey/">Steve Yegge</a>, somehow I hadn’t
run across him previously.<br/>
<i>Item:</i> Bruce Eckel on
<a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=141312">The
Departure of the Hyper-Enthusiasts</a>, which is too rich to summarize but if
you had to, it would be: Ruby is good, but not really good enough to beat
Python.
I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/12/20/Languages">wrote about this before</a>,
but the conversation it started really has legs.<br/>
<i>Item:</i> Steve Yegge pushes back with
<a href="http://www.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/anti-anti-hype.html">A
little anti-anti-hype</a>, which argues that friendlier languages sometimes
beat better languages, e.g. Perl vs. Python.  The piece is, he admits,
inflammatory.<br/>
<i>Item:</i> Speaking of friendly languages, if Steve is right, Ruby has won,
check out

which isn’t just friendly, it’s a cute little puppy bouncing in your lap,
licking your nose.<br/>

previous piece that he wrote a follow-up,
<a href="http://www.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/bambi-meets-godzilla.html">Bambi

that you don’t mind.<br/>
<i>Item:</i> Steve’s
<a href="http://www.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/tour-de-babel.html">Tour
de Babel</a> is a really funny and entertaining romp through a bunch of
languages.<br/>
<i>Item:</i> Steve’s also interested in other-languages-on-the-JVM, just like
me. Unlike me, he positively despises the Java language.  Memorable quote: “Java
has lots of wonderful features, but <i>Java</i> isn’t one of them.  Java’s
appeal as a platform for doing real work rests precisely on its strengths as a
platform, not as a language.”  This is in
<a href="http://opal.cabochon.com/~stevey/sokoban/docs/article-java.html">JVM
Languages: Java 5</a>, from the series entitled
<a href="http://www.cabochon.com/~stevey/sokoban/">Stevey’s JVM Language
Soko-Shootout</a>, a really interesting run at a sample programming problem in
a bunch of different languages running on the JVM.<br/>
<i>Item:</i> Speaking of those languages, it turns out that
<a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/">Charles Nutter</a> who
(with Thomas Enebo) leads the JRuby project, has a blog, in
which he’s recently written about
<a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/2006/03/irb-is-go.html">Getting IRB
Going</a> which he kind of has (although it turns out to be hard), enough to
type in Swing 
(!) code; and a piece which starts talking about
<a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/2006/03/jruby-progress-updates-jruby-on-rails.html">JRuby
on Rails</a>, but veers into a <em>very</em> interesting discussion of JRuby performance.</p>

<p>Like I’ve said before, I was in favor of taking down Saddam.  But the
crumbling tower of stinking lies used to sell the war, then the nauseating
incompetent brutality with which it’s been pursued, 
have pushed the cost/benefit equation way negative.
Today, on one of the TV shows, US Rep. John Murtha
<a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2006/03/05.html#a7402">said</a>: “The only solution to this is to redeploy. Let me tell you, the only people who want us in Iraq is Iran and al-Qaeda. I’ve talked to a top-level commander the other day, it was about two weeks ago, and he said China wants us there also. Why? Because we’re depleting our resources, our troop resources and our fiscal resources.”
Sounds convincing to me.</p>

<title>The ASF Server</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Sun gave the Apache Software Foundation a server last year, and I kept
hearing, over coffee and beer, that they were running some scary-huge number
of projects on it, all independently via zones; really remarkable numbers.
I kept
asking them to write about it, and they kept not writing.
So here’s an email interview with
<a href="http://www.toftum.dk/">Mads Toftum</a>, who does a lot of sysadmin-ing
around the ASF.
I don’t know how typical their workload is, but I’m an old sysadmin myself
and I found this pretty interesting.
Mads doesn’t blow his own horn much, but this is a remarkable installation.</p>
<p><i>Tim: What was donated, and when was that?</i></p>
<p>Mads: A v40z (4 single core AMD, 16G memory) and a 3511 disk array
with 5*250G 
IDE drives.  I don’t have an exact date but it was right around the
release date for sol10.</p>
<p><i>How was the installation/setup?  Surprises?</i></p>
<p>We had a sun engineer doing the work for us, so no real surprises
other than him using the most common root password ever.
My day job includes more than enough
Solaris that there weren’t many surprises other than a few missing bits
in x86 Solaris compared to the SPARC based gear I’m used to. The raid
array did cause a fair bit of grief, but eventually we got that under
control and I moved the zones over to it during apachecon.</p>
<p><i>What are you using it for, and how is it set up?</i></p>
<p>The setup is pretty standard - the infrastructure team runs the global
zone and try to provide most common software on request.</p>
<p>The way it generally works, a PMC can ask for a zone to run their
software - then I build a zone for them, and hand over root to whomever
they have as their admin. After that, we generally don’t hear much from
them unless they get themselves into trouble or we have to take care of
runaway processes. </p>
<p>There’s close to 20 zones now spread over different projects doing
things like automated builds, doc generation (fairly common), TCK
testing and automated tests. Spamassassin is by far the greatest CPU
hog, but there are also others using a fair bit of resources to build
docs, run gump and use mavens continuum. We’ve also got a couple of
zones that are used to develop infrastructure services like
projects.apache.org and other things that aren’t public yet.</p>
<p>We’re still stressing that it is an experimental service but a few of
the projects are ignoring that and starting to depend on their zone (I
just hope they don’t have to learn about experimental the hard way).</p>
<p><i>How heavy’s the workload?  System holding up OK?</i></p>
<p>We’ve had a couple of incidents over time and I’m seeing more and more
of the automated builds beginning to overlap - ideally I’d like to find
another box to move the automated build activities out of the way. I’ve
asked to postpone a generic build zone project because I want to make sure it
doesn’t impact other projects.</p>
<p><i>Why zones?</i></p>
<p>They are the only way we can share a machine between so many projects
without placing a very high load on our infra people. Trying to sort out
20 different projects within the same machine would be close to
impossible because we couldn’t delegate privileges.</p>
<p><i>If you were doing it with Linux instead, how would you approach  
the problem of dealing out the projects?  Same question for *BSD.</i></p>
<p>There’s jails for BSD and similar solutions for Linux, but at the time
we were setting up the machine, none of those solutions would have given
us the same level of flexibility and virtualisation without adding extra
overhead. My guess is that we would have gone with a solution similar to
what we have, but we might have ended up with a more restricted model.</p>
<p><i>Using SMF?  Like it?</i></p>
<p>After getting over the initial disgust over all the added xml cruft,
I’ve gotten as far as seeing the benefits, but SMF still needs more work
as the SMF discussions on OpenSolaris.org shows.</p>
<p><i>What do the Solaris engineers need to be working on?</i></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Better patch management (patching zones is no fun) and being able to
use liveupgrade with zones would make me a lot less worried about
upgrading from several thousand miles away.</p></li>
<li><p>resource caps / FSS integration for other things than just CPU - we
need to be able to limit other resources like memory and possibly IO
too.</p></li>
<li><p>zone migration would be good too.</p></li>
<li><p>dtrace in zones</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Luckily all these are already in the works and I expect seeing the last
3 in a not too distant future release. Other than that, there’s still
some work to be done on better hardware support in the X86 area and a
few other minor details.</p>
<p><i>CPU-limited, I/O-limited, memory-limited?</i></p>
<p>All of the above although memory problems are very rare - people
generally try to behave and don’t quite use as many resources as they
could have gotten away with. Most projects run in a single process
gobbling only one out of 4 CPUs, but recently that has been changing.</p>
<p><i>Which Apache project burns the most resources?</i></p>
<p>Spamassassin by a wide margin although others are working hard to catch
up. This is of course something I can make less evident with FSS, but as
mentioned earlier that doesn’t quite fix all our problems.</p>
<p>I think that’s about it - we’re talking a bit about moving some of our
other services to zones, but that probably won’t happen as long as we’ve
only got the one machine.</p>

<title>Salem</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>On Friday morning I flew down to Portland, drove to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem,_Oregon">Salem</a>, and helped out
with a Sun sales presentation to the state government from 10AM to 5PM.  I
don’t get 
to do many sales calls which is a pity because I love them.  I probably
shouldn’t queer the pitch by going into details (I will if we get the
business, because it’s interesting), but I have to say that the
state-government people we were pitching to had smart questions and were
endearingly obsessive about the application; and I would be too in their
position, it’s one of the Things That Matters.  I flew home out of PDX that
same evening and damn was I tired.  But the State Capitol is worth looking at,
so I took a couple of pictures.</p>
<p>It was all built in the 1930s in lovely white marble, in a style that
is really not trying to be Westminster or Versailles or DC, the lines are
clean and look good against a grey sky, which you get a lot of the Pacific
Northwest.</p>
<img src="IMG_4405.jpg" alt="Oregon state government buildings in Salem against a grey sky" />
<p>The Capitol building itself has a central tower with uplifting humanist
homilies chiseled into the broad faces of white marble. Nice inside too, no
in-your-face security, very welcoming.</p>
<p>Then, up on top of that white tower, there’s this Big Gold Guy, officially
the Oregon Capitol Pioneer.  It turns that you can read about
<a href="http://www.oregonlink.com/goldenpioneer/index.html">Gilding Oregon
Capitol Pioneer</a> (cool site, and I like
<a href="http://www.oregonlink.com/goldenpioneer/inspection/04_faceandhand.html">this
one</a>) and I got two pictures, one each against blue sky and
grey.</p>

<title>More ZFS Data</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I see that
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/danasblog?entry=zfs_v_ufs_performance_for">Dana H. Myers</a> has been digging away at ZFS performance using the
only metric that really matters to the real geek: OS build performance.
The numbers are interesting... I’m surprised that compression made so little
difference, both source and object code compress quite well (I just ran a
little test: the Emacs binary compressed to 18% of its size, a bunch of Java
code to 19%.)
Maybe the fact
that it’s zillions of little files means that the file open/create overhead
dominates the actual input/output time?  
There is no doubt there is a huge amount of work to be done on I/O
performance, both understanding it and improving it.
But ZFS is increasingly looking like a step forward.</p>

<title>ETech 2006 — Generalities</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’ve been here at
<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etech/">ETech</a> since suppertime Monday, and I thought I’d just
let my report grow as I went along, which is dumb, because it flies in the face
of the medium, and the piece grew tumerously to a really unreasonable size.
So I’ll break it up into a bunch of focused fragments.
This one is on the conference itself, and whether you’d want to come to it.</p>
<p>I’m not sure.  There are people out there saying conferences are
over, it’s about camps and unconferences, and I have to say, some of that
resonates with me.  The parade of people across the stage, some speaking well,
some badly, some pitching products, most  badly, well it gets kinda old.
On the other hand, there’s quite a bit to be said for spending part of an hour
listening to someone who’s really got a message to deliver and puts some
practice and passion into the delivery.  Rhetoric had its traditional place
among the Arts 
and Sciences—and not as the least of them—for a reason.
And there’s also something to be said for sitting in a session, your attention
wandering, maybe just gazing blankly at your feedreader but maybe with your
thinking punctuated by the venue and crowd and the mental 
background painted by whoever’s talking.</p>
<p>So, I dunno.  It costs a lot—really a lot—and I don’t know how to go about
putting a value on it. 
I deeply enjoy the time hanging in the hallways and talking to interesting
people, and if you’ve got messages to deliver—I have a bunch, with Sun and Atom
and WS-reality and Dynamic Languages and so on—it’s a good way to deliver
them.
Now, I already have a good way to tell the world things I care about; that
would be this blog that you’re currently reading.
How many more people do I engage when I get into the conference hotel with them?
Like I said, I just don’t know.
But I like being there.</p>
<p>Some of the keynoters were excellent.  Some otherwise, occasionally the
first rows became hazardous due to high wind velocities produced by onstage
hand-waving. 
Almost all of the product presentations were lame; but at fifteen
minutes, they were at least short.  The track sessions that I went to were
mostly pretty good.</p>
<p>I think the world needs things like ETech.  
I think O’Reilly does a good job of putting it on—the organization and
logistics (except for the network, which kept running out of juice) were
impeccable.
But I wish we could keep the
good bits, discard the rest, and make this conference a little more Un.</p>

<p>FeedBurner’s
<a href="http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/api/feedflare">FeedFlare API</a> looks
interesting.
(Actually, there are a <em>ton</em> of Web APIs out there looking
interesting, nobody could keep up.)  But follow that link above and search for
“Atom”; they’re abstracting the universe of feed formats using Atom 1.0 to
give you something consistent and useful to write XPaths against.  Microsoft’s
doing the same 
thing in the IE7 API, but they’re abstracting to a bastardized
not-quite-RSS2.0 format they made up themselves, which is kind of a confusing
thing to do and will make the world learn yet another model.
Atom’s
<a href="http://www.dynamicobjects.com/d2r/archives/003343.html">popping up over in Ning-land too</a>, they’re using the format to expose
their applications and data, and are working on making it all writeable via
the Atom Publishing Protocol (APP).
And at ETech I heard about a couple more guerilla APP implementations, at big
smart well-known outfits, not
comprehensive or intended for exposure (yet) to the world, just cooked up in a
hurry to get something done that needed doing.  My spidey sense is tingling.</p>

<title>ETech — On Attention</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The conference blurb said “It’s time to build <b>The Attention Economy</b>”.
What’s that, I wonder?
The shindig was certainly equipped with lots of people holding forth on the
subject, so this was my chance to find out.
I took to accosting total strangers in the hallways saying “What do you think
about this whole ‘Attention’ thing?”</p>
<p>Their answers took two forms: “I don’t get it” and “Yeah, sounds like you
might be able to build some cool stuff with it”.
I’m in the first camp: I freely admit to Not Getting It.
But I can report some of the more compelling things that were said.
I omit some presentations because I missed then and others because, as far as
I could tell, they consisted entirely of vacuous hand-waving.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Dave Sifry</h2>
<p>I missed some of Dave’s talk, but he sure had some phrases worth capturing:
“We have enough money.  We don’t have enough time.”
“Give someone fun and creative to do, and they’ll go create the world for
you.”
“Hyperlinks are votes of attention.” 
I certainly agree with that last one.
We already know how to count links... is that a good enough measure of
attention?  If it isn’t, what is?</p>
<h2 id='p-8'>Linda Stone</h2>
<p>She invented the “continuous partial attention” meme; I really enjoyed her
speech, which was basically a pushback against the condition it describes.
Sound-bites:
“An artificial sense of constant crisis... fight-or-flight response.”
“The distractions are mice, not tigers.” 
“24/7 doesn’t feel so good any more.”</p>
<p>She says that young people respond to her ideas, want to get off the
treadmill, and I can understand.</p>
<p>But then she claims that email is ineffective for decision-making and crisis
management.  The first is not true, I have been engaged in making important
complex decisions mostly by email, mostly in the context of standards efforts,
for about ten years now.  If she were right, we could disband the IETF.</p>
<p>She points out that powerful tools, like chipper-shredders, need guidelines
for safe use; alleges that email is an attention chipper-shredder.</p>
<p>Also, I have to confess that I get nervous when someone describes something
that a lot of people are doing, apparently because they want to, and says
“This is a bad thing, they shouldn’t do it.”
But there’s no denying that Ms Stone has got her finger on a pain point.</p>
<p>I’m not going to try to recreate the arc of her argument, which was pretty
nuanced and thorough.
On the subject of what to do, she suggested a future of interconnected
networks... me and my network, rather than me and the world.</p>
<p>“What do we really need?  What do we want to pay attention to?  It’s our
scarcest and most valuable resource; it does define us.”  Strong words, but
on the other hand, she was not terribly successful at unhooking the audience’s
eyes from their laptop screens.  Which observation supports at least some of
her argument.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Attention Economy</h2>
<p>I wonder if I’ll recognize it when I see it?</p>

<title>ETech — Good Pitches</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is just a potpourri of pitches, specifically the ones that were good
and memorable.  Includes rare complimentary remarks about Microsoft
technology.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Ray Ozzie</h2>
<p>He’s pumped about RSS as “the DNA to wire the web”; the connective tissue
between 
active websites.  He talks about “Composite Applications”; for example, Unix
pipes are weaving together a composite app.  Claims <code>&lt;</code> is like
“copy”, <code>|</code> like “cut”, and <code>></code> like “paste”.
Then the question arises: “Where is the clipboard of the Web?”</p>
<p>The demo was “Live Clipboard” (integrated with Windows clipboard).  “Great
way to bridge from Web to PC”.  Smart, structured, tagged data on the clipboard.
You can paste in a feed object, which then remains dynamic.</p>
<p>Granted, it was pretty well pasted-together vaporware.  But the idea might
have legs.</p>
<h2 id='p-9'>Rod Smith</h2>
<p>IBM’s VP of emerging technologies showed yet another maps mashup, and the
system for constructing it.  I wasn’t that impressed.
But there was a Big Idea behind it: maybe we’re looking at a
future full of applications that are small-scale and transient, rather than
big and long-lived.  Maybe.  Personally, I don’t use any such
applications at the moment, and one of the great things about software is that
it doesn’t wear out; but this is supposed to be <em>emerging</em> tech,
right?</p> 
<h2 id='p-12'>Clay Shirky</h2>
<p>In his talk <cite>A Pattern Language for Moderation Strategies</cite> he
said lots of Really Smart Things about how to keep online communities
functioning in a 
non-toxic way.  I hadn’t known Clay was working in this space, and will have
to check the work out and see where it leads.
Having been
the victim of substantial toxicity in the Syndication Slugfest, I care about
this stuff.</p>
<h2 id='p-13'>Kevin Lynch</h2>
<p>Showed the use of Macromedia oops Adobe Flash/Flex technology as
pipe-fitting to put together things that would update in parallel on a web
page, in an Excel spreadsheet, and in a Flash app.  Which was nifty and got a
round of applause.  One doesn’t normally think of Flash as invisible
behind-the-scenes plumbing.</p>
<p>His notion of a “Service-Oriented Client” made my blood run a little cold
though, I thought we could isolate all that layered-services complexity off on
the server, which is built to do exactly that.
But I bet that Jonathan Schwartz, who tends to see big back-room boxes and
little desktop devices as more alike than different, would have been jumping
up and down saying “Yes!”</p> 
<h2 id='p-15'>Microsoft</h2>
<p>Wow... the Microsoft guy (didn’t get his name) showed up to pitch
<a href="http://www.live.com/">live.com</a>
in a dark (and <em>good</em>) suit &amp; tie outfit. 
I suppose he parachuted into the conference without checking out the ambiance.
The first impression of live.com is really good, and the AJAXy “smart scroll”
is really clever.  Time will tell whether this is inutile visual sugar, or
soon to become an essential piece of every web-builder’s toolkit.</p>
<h2 id='p-17'>George Dyson</h2>
<p>He took an amusing hop, skip &amp; jump through some history of of 
ideas relating to computation, touching not only on the obvious (Turing) but
the forgotten (Alfred Smee, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Ulam">Stan Ulam</a>, and Ross  
Ashby).</p>
<p>He asked: “Are we searching the information, or are the engines
searching
us?”</p> 
<h2 id='p-18'>Yahoo!</h2>
<p>There were like 300 different presentations by Yahoo people, but the one
that made the impression on me was their characterization of all this “Web
2.0” stuff they’re putting together as a “tribal platform”.
I’m impressed, they’re thinking really hard about what matters and how to wire
the pieces together.  They’d like a “common vocabulary” around this stuff,
hence their recent
<a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/ypatterns/">patterns library</a>.</p>
<h2 id='p-19'>Niall Kennedy’s “Feeds” Session</h2>
<p>A Microsoft program manager (missed her name) presented the Microsoft
feed-using 
infrastructure.  Summary: it looks like the user experience will be good.
It runs at the OS-level, with one data store, usable by multiple apps.
When she was done, Niall pointed out that the next level up is a Web-level
rather than OS-level platform to do these things.
Which is obviously, particularly relevant for people who are nomadic from
computer to computer; that’s a lot of people.</p>

<title>ETech — San Diego Trolley</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>It’s a nice enough town, but it’s out of the way and, in my experience, not
that easy to get around in.
The hotel was sold out when I tried to get in a couple weeks ago (but some
last-minute arrivals got in fine, hrumph).  
Anyhow, I ended up at a Doubletree at a
place called “Hazard Center” which is bit of a ways out, but when I was
driving the rental in I noticed something that looked like a train station
across the street.  Sure enough, the San Diego Trolley will take you from
there to the convention hotel in about 20 minutes for $1.50, which beats
struggling through the traffic in the car and paying at least ten times that
for parking.
Oddly, the people on the train were few in number, and they all seemed
well-dressed, well-fed, and well-rested; a typical-California
ethnic mashup, and most were reading books.  This isn’t like public transport
in other places.
On the other hand, when you want to go home after ten at night, the trains
run less often, and many of the people are neither well-dressed, well-fed, nor
well-rested (you can tell because they’re asleep).  But the trains aren’t
crowded then either.  All in all, it seems 
to be a fine system.</p>

<title>Family Fun</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>For my “Atom as a Case Study” presentation at ETech, I wanted to give the
audience a feel for the endless, wearing nastiness in the syndication
community.
It wasn’t hard to find a couple of samples of ignorant
childish vituperation from the week before the conference to hold up as
examples, but I thought that a little light relief was in order, too.
So I put together a photomontage slide show to the tune of <cite>Ride
of the Valkyries</cite>, 25 pictures of battlefield panoramas, 
alien invaders, monsters fighting, 
Mexican wrestling, superhero combat, slavering vampires, frightened soldiers,
crashing planes, fantasy warriors with big ugly weapons, and so on.  It was
kind of amusing, if I say so myself.
After the talk someone came up and asked “What tag did you use to find
that stuff?”
It wasn’t like that; back at home on the weekend I was poking around Google
and Yahoo image search looking for things like “combat”, “monster”, “explosion“,
“battle”, “weapon”, and so on and the six-year-old cruised by and looked at my
screen.  Boy, was he ever hooked.  So I settled him into the chair beside me
and we spent a really enjoyable half-hour cruising the Internet for pictures
of violence and destruction (Safe Search <em>definitely</em> on).  
He was quick to pipe up “Ooh, that one, Daddy!” but puzzled by a couple

<title>ETech — Mark Pilgrim</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Hey, I finally got to meet 
<a href="http://www.diveintomark.org/">Mark Pilgrim</a>, with whom I’ve had a
lengthy and occasionally vexed online relationship.
This fragment is mostly just an excuse to post a picture.</p>
<p>Mark looks remarkably normal and
doesn’t dominate a conversation the way he dominates online discourse.
A good person, I think, and now engaged full-time on making Firefox more
accessible, which is obviously A Good Thing to be working on.</p>
<img src="IMG_4432.jpg" alt="Mark Pilgrim" />
<p>Mark’s talk on Greasemonkey was low-key, quietly amusing, technically
dense, well-constructed.  But then there was a side-trip on when to write,
from whence these: “Write when you’re filled with wonder.” “If
you wait until you’re an expert, it’s too late.”  “Write when you can’t not
write.”</p>
<p>It’s a pity that he no longer blogs, but what with one mailing list and
another, he’s still writing.  If I, as promised, add comments to
<span class='o'>ongoing</span>, he said he’d drop by.
This makes me only slightly nervous.</p>

<title>FSS: Casablanca Eclipse</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Friday Slide Scan #25 has two pictures of a partial eclipse of the sun over
Casablanca, Morocco.</p>
<img src="A11019.jpg" alt="Partial eclipse of the sun over Casablanca, Morocco" />
<img src="A11021.jpg" alt="Partial eclipse of the sun over Casablanca, Morocco" />
<p>These were taken by my Dad, who lived in Casablanca for several years in
the Eighties.
I’ve never been to Africa; my then-wife and I had invitations from my Dad when
he lived in Morocco, Zambia, and Tanzania; but she didn’t want to go.</p>
<p>Images in the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1953
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/08/11/MomsGarden">Jean Bray</a>, Tim Bray, Cath
Bray, and
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>; when I know
exactly who took one, I’ll say; in this case, Bill Bray.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using
a Nikon CoolScan 4000 ED scanner and cleaned up by a combination of the Nikon
scanning software and PhotoShop Elements.</p>

<p>Hey check out the

Now you, too, can have the Universal Feed Icon in any size and (with a bit of

<span class='o'>ongoing</span>, now smaller, color-coordinated, and
repositioned.  The idea of a simple uniform graphic that still has some room

<p>For some time, the
<a href="http://www.feedvalidator.org/">Feed Validator</a> has been muttering
warnings about
<a href="/ongoing/ongoing.atom">my Atom 1.0 feed</a>, having to do with my
aggressive use of <code>xml:base</code> and relative URIs.
I fixed that up, and managed to convince Sam Ruby that one of the warnings
(due to a redirect from <code>tbray.org</code> to <code>www.tbray.org</code>)
was bogus.  So
<a href="http://feedvalidator.org/check.cgi?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tbray.org%2Fongoing%2Fongoing.atom">the
validator’s happy</a>.
I also took a little extra trouble to prettify the feed, and now I think it’s
probably useful as an example of a fairly full-featured and
ultra-squeaky-clean Atom 1.0 feed; somewhat human-readable, even.
Have a look at
<a href="/ongoing/ongoing.atom">my feed</a> and 
<a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/index.atom">Sam’s</a> side-by-side,
his is very readable too, there are some points where the difference between
Sam’s choices and mine are instructive.
Anyone have a suggestion on how my feed might be improved, to serve even
better as an example?</p>

<title>5✭♫: Rock n Roll Animal</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The last five-star piece, from two weeks ago, was about the Cowboy Junkies.
They covered <cite>Sweet Jane</cite> on their excellent <cite>The Trinity
Sessions</cite> album, and
<a href="http://www.loureed.org/">Lou Reed</a> was quoted as saying that their
version 
was definitive.  He’s wrong; his own take on this 1974 live set is at
another level entirely.
So is much of the record.  If you had to name the greatest live rock
record of all time, well you couldn’t, but if you had to name the top five,
this would be one: it shows how hard rock ought to be played.
There are some problems: it’s kind of bombastic in places, and it does
glamorize the use of addictive narcotics; but let’s not be picky.
<i>(“5✭♫” series introduction <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music">here</a>;
with <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music#p-1">an
explanation</a> of why the title may look broken.)</i></p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Context</h2>
<p>Lou’s done a lot of good work over the years, and hasn’t stopped. 
I’m not old or hip enough to have been a Velvet Underground fan, and
I don’t have his
twenty-first century <cite>Ecstasy</cite>; but from last decade, <cite>Magic and
Loss</cite> and (especially) the Reed/Cale collaboration <cite>Songs for
Drella</cite> are really very good.</p>
<p>Lou’s arc from Drug-Driven Sex God to older-but-wiser New York Poet
Laureate (no, not really, I don’t even know if they have one) has been
remarkably graceful.</p>
<img src="RnRA-cover.png" class="inline" alt="Lou Reed's Rock n Roll Animal" />
<h2 id='p-2'>The Music</h2>
<p>When I decided to write this, I wondered why I only had two of the songs
on my computer; then remembered that I’d snagged them off Napster because that
was easier than ripping CDs, back in the day.  
What I have are <cite>Intro/Sweet
Jane</cite> and <cite>White Light/White Heat</cite>; but I look at the track
listing and I think I’d probably have clicked that fifth iTunes star on a
couple more.
I’m definitely going to have to reload this one off the disc.</p>
<p>Let’s see: the band is tight as any famous-name classical string quartet,
the guitars are orchestrated and played well; Lou’s vocals are
wasted-sounding, which is appropriate, but the 
phrasing and timing is right up there.  And the songs, those songs are
jam-packed full of wonderful melodies and lyrics that get their hooks into
your brain and won’t let go.</p>
<p>Well, OK, on the other side of the coin, yes, it’s heavy pompous Seventies
glam/arena rock, and two of the songs are totally about getting high, and the
guitar-playing isn’t very innovative (it’s very good, just not very
innovative) and <cite>Heroin</cite> in particular hasn’t worn all that well.
But still, this is really extra-fine music.</p>
<p>Over at
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RD54/sr=8-1/qid=1142232121/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-5167035-8572614?%5Fencoding=UTF8">Amazon</a>, there’s a savage Editorial Review by one Douglas Wolk,
saying “the album’s hard to like now”.  Well, I think that if you never
actually <em>liked</em> heavy guitar-based glam rock, that would be true.  
But within the context of that genre, this is a gem.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Sampling It</h2>
<p>Don’t bother.  If you like hard rock (<em>very</em> hard rock) built around
good songs and good playing, just go buy it; otherwise not.
I see there’s a re-issue with two new tracks.</p>

<p>It’s Spring Break, so we’re in Saskatchewan with the kid visiting his
grandmothers.  I’ll be out at Lauren’s Mom’s farm for the next three days with
lousy Internet access.  This is partly by design; I am seriously behind on my
Java One deliverables and a day or two hiding upstairs at the farm, away from
the Net, while 
Lauren hangs out with her mother and the kid with the animals, may help get me
caught up. 
In the interim, here are three very Saskatchewan photos.</p>
<p>Here’s what the weather’s like.</p>

an excellent conservatory where I found this Amaryllis.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the Regina airport, there was a

all sorts of regalia, letting everyone know that
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brier">The Brier</a>—the Canadian
Men’s Curling Championship, and arguably the toughest curling event in the
world—was in progress.  So we got tickets and caught a draw of four matches;
here’s a shot at the Alberta-Manitoba match, which was a real barn-burner and
went into an extra end.  Great fun, and there’s nothing more Canadian.</p>

<title>WS-Crossroads</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Check out 
<a href="http://www.optimizemag.com/article/showArticle.jhtml?articleId=180207087">Web
Services at a Crossroads</a>, by Daryl Plummer, who’s group VP and chief
fellow at Gartner.
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/02/22/WS-Flurry">Yet another</a> finding that
when it comes to Web Services, you can choose between simple,reliable,
standards-based infrastructure that’s here now and the sprawling, shifting
WS-* technology that’s still under construction, mostly by IBM and
Microsoft, both well-known champions of simplicity.
Plummer’s piece is mostly right, but I’m going to ignore Tolstoy’s advice and
pick some nits.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Tolstoy?</h2>
<p>It’s a couple of decades since I read <cite>War and Peace</cite>, but I
seem to remember that the last hundred pages or so are mostly a really boring
lecture on military theory, the central lesson being “When your adversary is
doing what you want him to, don’t get in the way.”
Well, if Gartner is now granting the point I’ve been trying to make for the
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/Web/Services/">last two years</a>, I
guess, per Tolstoy, I should bloody well shut up and get out of the way.
But Plummer’s piece contains some important mistakes and some
potentially-dangerous framing that I think shouldn’t go unaddressed.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Standards-Based!?!?!?</h2>
<p>Plummer says “First, only 20% of all enterprise systems built today require
the kind of 
robustness that standards-based Web services provide.”  I think that when he
says “standards-based Web services”, he means WS-*.  Well, excuse me, HTTP and
XML, the things that REST-flavored lightweight services are based on, have
been stable, ratified, international standards for a decade or so, while the
legion of WS-* specs are still mostly unratified by anyone but their authors
at IBM and Microsoft.  There’s only one option
available today that’s actually standards-based.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>What Are Web Services?</h2>
<p>Plummer says they are “defined as Web applications that use open standards
to interact with one another dynamically across heterogeneous systems.”  Uh,
no; they are defined as distributed programming interfaces based on specifying
message exchange patterns (the messages usually being XML) rather than object
models and method calls.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Two Camps?</h2>
<p>“Users fall into two camps. One group advocates using Web services to build
complex internal systems known as enterprise service-oriented architectures
(SOAs). The other seeks to use emerging Web technologies in tandem with Web
services to create flexible external applications.”  I’m kind of puzzled; it
seems to me like the pressures on both inward-facing and outward-facing
applications are pretty similar: operation across heterogeneous systems,
stringent reporting and auditing requirements, high performance.
And Service-Orientation is pretty important out there on the Net, too... the
notion that the term “SOA” is reserved for talking about internal systems
seems dangerous and wrong.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>What are Web Services For?</h2>
<p>“When it comes to building SOAs, I can’t get over how much effort is wasted
trying to force Web services to deliver enterprise-level capabilities they
were never intended to handle. For example, managers at a well-known airline
once asked me how to make their Web services provide an enterprise-level
distributed-transaction environment.”
Perhaps, those airline managers had read the
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/webservices/understanding/specs/default.aspx">official
map of WS-standards</a> over at Microsoft, which has a whole category called
“Transactions”, with draft specs that seem to suggest they should be used in,
you know, enterprise-level distributed-transaction environments.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Plummer is OK</h2>
<p>Having spent four paragraphs finding fault with Plummer’s language and
terminology, it’s important to note that he also says some really smart
things; about granularity, and risks around interoperability and
programmability.</p>
<p>I think he’s also arguing that even in the REST context, SOAP envelopes are
probably a large part of the network-computing picture going forward.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>Sun</h2>
<p>I think our position is clear.  Microsoft is making a huge, company-scale
bet on the WS-Future; a really remarkable amount of work by Really Smart People
went into WCF.  The customers that that adopt this stuff will need to work
with the Java universe and with our enterprise products, and we’ve said we’ll
work with Microsoft to make that happen.  (For a sample of that
interoperability work, see Arun Gupta’s recent
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/arungupta?entry=sun_participating_in_ws_policy">Sun participating in WS-Policy Interop Workshop</a>
and Rohan Pinto’s
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/rohanpinto?entry=it_takes_2_to_tango">It
Takes 2 to Tango</a>.)</p>
<p>Speaking for myself, not for Sun, I think that we ought to be pouring
resources and investment into tooling and developer support around simple
XML/HTTP/REST technologies.  You know, the standardized ones that work
today.</p>

<title>Snow, Death, Verticals</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This trip is supposed to be for Spring Break, but in Saskatchewan, Spring
hasn’t arrived yet.  It’s been hitting -20°C at night, with the wind
brisk; that’s a nasty combination.  Well, you don’t come here for the
weather, but the photo opps have been scarce too; the March light, until
Friday, was alternately hazy and harsh.  Herewith four pictures of snow.</p>
<p>I forced myself to do some walks around the farm even 
with the alarming wind chill.  At the top of one little
hill, I felt duty-bound to photograph, if only to prove that the Prairies can
be unbeautiful.  But the flat white sky and flat white snow, even though it
felt kind of dim, were so bright that I couldn’t see the LED on the pocket
cam, so I just pointed it here and there and shot a few.  This is PhotoShopped
some, but sure looks like like what I saw.</p>
<img src="IMG_4535.jpg" alt="White snow, white sky, early Saskatchewan spring" />
<div class="caption"><p>If you were lost and alone in a Prairie winter, this
is what death would look like.</p></div>
<p>When it wasn’t overcast, the light was somehow glaring and ugly every other
time I went out, I can’t explain it.  But late Friday, the eve of our
departure, I dared a last sunset hike; it was even more cold and blustery, if
that’s 
possible, and I only lasted a few minutes.  When I came in I was still holding
the camera because I didn’t trust my frozen hands to pack it back
up without dropping it.  I ended up with a tremendous number of appealing snow
shots, and picked these three because they share an obvious visual theme.</p>

the same name</a> at 
<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/et2006/">ETech 2006</a>.
The talk’s sections were entitled <i>Why?</i>, <i>How?</i>, <i>What?</i>, and
<i>Lessons?</i>; I’ve left out <i>What?</i>, the description of what Atom is,
since we’ve had plenty of that around here.  That leaves <i>Why</i> we built it, <i>How</i>
we built it, and what <i>Lessons</i> you might want take away from the
experience.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Why?</h2>
<p>Q: RSS is the world’s most successful application of XML; why 
monkey with a good thing?  A: Tech problems and people problems.</p>
<p>The most obvious technical problem is that there isn’t just one “RSS”,
there are
<a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/02/04/incompatible-rss">several
incompatible versions</a>.  But RSS 2.0 has the biggest mindshare and market
share; deservedly, in my opinion.
Most people, starting from scratch, would (correctly) pick 2.0 as
the RSS version to go with.</p>
<p>And there are some issues with RSS 2.0.  Nothing that keeps it from working
just fine across the universe of the Blogosphere, but real irritants.
<i>Item:</i> It’s not clear whether you’re allowed to have
<a href="http://www.cadenhead.org/workbench/news/2866/really-simple-syndication-joy-specs">more
than one enclosure</a>.  <i>Item:</i> An item title is either in HTML, or not,
and there’s no way to find out which, which can cause
<a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2004/05/28/detente#Reuters">silent
data loss</a>, and make RSS 2.0 unsuitable for some applications,
<a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=313441">like
Bugzilla</a>.
<i>Item:</i> Relative links don’t work: If you have pictures right there in
the same directory as an item’s HTML, you still can’t say 
<nobr><code>&lt;img src="cute-cat.jpg"/></code></nobr>, you have to fill in
the server and directory and everything, which makes your feed bulky, more
brittle and less portable.  For example, see 
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/ongoing.rss">my RSS feed</a>.
<i>Item:</i> Increasingly, people want to use non-ASCII characters in URIs,
but in RSS 2.0
<a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/02/26/International-Feeds">you
can’t do that</a>.</p>
<p>Then there’s the issue of APIs.  RSS is a wonderful tool to help make the
web writeable by everyone, but most web-writing tools suck.
If we want them to suck less, it would be great if there were a standard API
that anyone who wanted to develop a writer’s tool could use to talk
to lots of different publishing systems.  Unfortunately, the Blogger and
MetaWeblog APIs are all we have now, and they’re pretty lame; see
<a href="http://bblfish.net/blog/page7.html#2005/06/20/22-28-18-208">here</a>, 
<a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/stories/2003/01/26/evolve.html">here</a>,
and
<a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/10/15/dive.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The conclusion is obvious; while RSS 2.0 is a wonderful success story,
there’s still work to do in the syndication format space.
So you might think the thing to do would be to get together informally and
improve what we have now, and ship it as RSS 3.0.
That would be a bad idea.  Getting together informally would lead to an
implosion, and calling it RSS 3.0 would be against the rules.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Bad Craziness</h2>
<p>The fact of the matter is that for reasons that nobody seems to understand,
working on syndication standards flips the asshole bit,
even in the most reasonable
people, leading to seriously nasty behavior.</p>
<p>Everyone who’s been within shouting distance of any of these processes
knows all about it, but for the benefit of the ETech audience I displayed two
instances of clueless childish abuse which had occurred within the week prior
to the conference.  But you know, I could have found that sort of stuff for
nearly any week stretching back years now.</p>
<p>Even if you were determined to ignore the bad behavior and tough it out,
there are some rules in effect.  The
<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss">RSS 2.0 specification</a>
includes a <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss#roadmap">Roadmap</a>
section that says “Therefore, the RSS spec is, for all practical purposes,
frozen at version 2.0.1. We anticipate possible 2.0.2 or 2.0.3 versions,
etc. only for the purpose of clarifying the specification, not for adding new
features to the format. Subsequent work should happen in modules, using
namespaces, and in completely new syndication formats, with new names.”
Which is clear enough, and there’s real value in clarity.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>How?</h2>
<p>Producing Atom has been a Whole Lot of Work, and it’s not (quite) done yet.  First,
let’s quote
<a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/02/20/Mr-Safe">Sam
Ruby</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Remember that Echo
effort Jon told you about?  We started based on experiences
with RSS, but otherwise with a clean slate.  We had
interminable discussions over the name of the effort.  Then we
had interminable discussions over which standards body to
pick.  Then we had interminable discussions over dates. 
Eventually we solved all the issues above as well as other issues
like relative URIs.  And we had to wait while the slow
standards process ground away.  And finally, we got an
official RFC issued by an internationally recognized standards
body: the
IETF. The same
organization that issued the HTTP and SMTP standards — these
are the protocols that power the web and email respectively.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me make that quantitative: After we’d worked for months on
<a href="http://intertwingly.net/wiki/pie">Sam’s Wiki</a>, we trotted over to
the IETF.  The production of
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4287.txt">RFC 4287</a> took 17,944 email
messages; the archive is 62.4MB in size.</p>
<p>The work so far on the Atom Publishing Protocol has been, relatively,
child’s play, a mere 4,361 messages occupying a mere 17.0MB.</p>
<p>After we’d finished hashing it out among ourselves, the whole IETF had a
chance to take a look, and caught some dorky things we’d missed.</p>
<p>There has been plenty of bad behavior, snarling, and name-calling in the
process.  It is not the case that RSS in particular provokes bad behavior:
it’s something about syndication in general that flips that you-know-what bit.
I and my Atom co-chair Paul Hoffman 
have had to warn and lecture and ban and ban again and tut-tut and generally
spend way too much time treating adults like children.  One WG member called
me “criminally insane” over an issue that’s so trivial I don’t remember
what it was.
And in fact, some
participants were driven away by the bad behavior of the others.</p>
<p>It would be fair to describe the process as slow, grinding, bureaucratic,
difficult, and tedious.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Lessons?</h2>
<p>In no particular order, my conclusions.  Many will, I’m sure, disagree with
one or more.</p>
<h3 id='p-5'>RSS is Good Enough</h3>
<p>Really; it hasn’t significantly got in the way while the blogosphere went
from nowhere to tens of millions strong.
Initially, Atom will be used by people who are actually getting stung by one
of those 
technical gotchas I mentioned above (e.g. Bugzilla, or high-value financial
feeds, or whatever), and/or by purists who dislike the RSS 2.0
spec, and/or by people/institutions who believe in capital-S Standards,
and/or by people who don’t like Dave Winer.  But I’m pretty sure that
there’ll be tons of RSS feeds around a decade or two out, and why not?</p>
<h3 id='p-6'>Reading and Writing</h3>
<p>Right now, a general-purpose feed reader has to be able to handle three
flavors of RSS and Atom 1.0.  On the other hand, if you’re <em>generating</em>
feeds, all you really need to support are RSS 2.0 and Atom 1.0, and within a
year, 
more or less all the software will read Atom 1.0 and that’ll start to look
really attractive for people who only want to generate one flavor.</p>
<h3 id='p-7'>The Protocol Is More Important</h3>
<p>The Atom Publishing Protocol, which everyone will probably call
“APP”, is a bigger deal than the data format.  The reason is simple: RSS
2.0 works well enough to get work done and interoperate pretty well.  
MetaWeblog basically doesn’t, and there’s a huge place in the ecosystem for a
portable API.  
If “Web 2.0” means anything, it means the Writeable Web, and right now writing
requires special tools and most of them aren’t very good.  You should be able
to write the web from your emailer and outliner and browser and camera and
spreadsheet and phone, and we need the APP to make that happen.</p>
<p>Since APP wants you to publish by posting Atom data there’ll be
a lot of Atom data; the protocol will drag the data format behind it.</p>
<h3 id='p-8'>The IETF Process Was a Good Idea</h3>
<p>Yes, even though it was a wearing bureaucratic grind.
If people get along, you don’t need process and rules and so on; but people
don’t get along; especially around syndication.  The IETF’s virtue, shared by
most sane standards organizations, is that it recognizes that fact and has a
process where you can deal with it and get work done and still be reasonably
open and inclusive.</p>
<p>Here’s an analogy; most people think that it’s pretty important that we
have a government of Laws not Men.  Which is to say, courts and lawyers and
litigation generally suck, but are better than the alternative.</p>
<p>Here’s a strong claim: Atom is arguably the canonical example of the place
where a formal standards org is appropriate: there’s a substantial body of
prior art, we kind of know what works and what doesn’t, and the culture is
broken enough that informal processes aren’t gonna get the job done.</p>
<h2 id='p-9'>Standards</h2>
<p>It’s a dirty job, but someone has to do it.  But not me, for a while.  
When we get through Atom, I’m awarding myself a few years’ break from the 
standards trenches.</p>

<title>Jon and the Minotaur</title>

<body>
<p>Jon Bosak (father of XML, terrific photographer, good person, etc.) was in
Vancouver for some meetings having to do with UBL (and be warned, there’s
going to be some more UBL tub-thumping around here), and encountered a
monster.</p>
<p>We took Jon to the UBC Botanical Garden for a walk, and they’ve recently
installed a large and impressive statue of a minotaur, with a turf maze placed
in front of it.  We all took pictures of each other and the statue.</p>

<p>As noted elsewhere today, we visited the UBC Botanical Garden, and only the
early rhododendrons and a few magnolias were in bloom.  I didn’t get any
good rhodo shots, but with magnolias you can’t miss.
If extreme densities of the colour pink bother you, please stay away; but
these are some awfully great-looking flowers.</p>
<p>The first picture here should let you know that magnolia trees can get
<em>big</em>; today’s the first day that I’ve managed to get anywhere trying
to shoot magnolias at a distance.</p>

<p>I recently upgraded to the 2.1 beta of
<a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a>, and it’s kind of
cruel software.  In your subscription list, it classifies feeds that haven’t

<title>24 Sun Months</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Gosh, I missed my anniversary a week back.  I stand by pretty 
well everything I said 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/03/15/OneSunYear">this time last year</a>.
The things I’m trying to convince Sun to do now are much harder than turning
on blogging, so it’s more painful and slower and sometimes I spend a whole
day in a bad mood.  But I’m not giving up, no no no.  
I’ve gotten emotionally engaged, this company still has some moss on the sides
and some grit in the gears, but with a little more shaking out and scrubbing
down, has the potential to be great again, and it’s worth trying.
Here’s one reason: Right now, I don’t think anyone really knows how software
developers are 
going to be going about their business in five years.  In some respects a
moment of unusual clarity, because <em>we know that we don’t know</em>.
Here’s something
cool: two or three times in the last few months, I’ve talked to someone here
who wanted to do something about something, and I’ve said “You need to talk
to...” and introduced them to someone else here that they hadn’t known.

<title>Atomic Google Hacks</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Check out Mihai Parparita’s
<a href="http://persistent.info/archives/2006/03/23/google-reader">Google
Reader Tidbits</a>, about how he used
<a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> hacks to do a bunch
of clever feed splicing.  The article is interesting, and I think Atom is
going to enable a bunch of feed-mashup creativity that I’m not smart enough to invent.
But I wanted to do a
deep-dive on the actual Atom feed he generated, which is
probably of interest only to obsessive
Atom 1.0 fetishists.</p>
<p>In this piece, when I use the technical terms <i>moron</i>, <i>asshole</i>,
and <i>angel</i>, I do so in the sense described in Mark Pilgrim’s monumental
<a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/08/16/specs">Why Specs
Matter</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s reproduce the top bit of the feed, which I’ve edited to make the
line-wrapping a little less painful; a <code>...</code> marks each deletion.
There are occasional instances of <i>moronic</i> behavior, but they’re in the
minority; in fact it’s generally clever.</p>
<p><i>Line 2:</i> They’ve introduced their own google-reader <code>gr:</code>
namespace for their own extensions; quite proper.</p>
<p><i>Line 3:</i> Using the <code>tag:</code> URI scheme for permanent, unique
IDs seems popular in Atom-land, and I’ve seen suggestions that it be
adopted as a best practice.  Me, I’d prefer to just use the HTTP URI for the
ID, because if you’re going to practice responsible Web stewardship, it’s
going to be bloody well just as permanent and unique.  But I’m something of an
acknowledged fanatic on this subject.</p>
<p><i>Line 6:</i> This is a Google-Reader-specific extension of some sort, and
I have no idea what it means, and that’s just fine.  Atom requires that
software tolerate this kind of thing, which is why we’ll probably never need
Atom 2.0 or even 1.0.0.0.1.</p>
<p><i>Line 12-13:</i> The <code>gr:original-id</code> is
usually the same as the <nobr><code>&lt;link rel="alternate"</code></nobr>
value, except when the feed’s coming off of feedburner, then it points at the
real article, not the feedburner redirect.</p>
<p><i>Line 14:</i> This a little brittle: the URI in <code>href=</code> is
relative, but to what?  To wherever you happened to pick up the feed from, I
suppose.  I think a feed-level <code>xml:base</code> might be in order.
But the <code>title=</code> is good practice, lots of software will pop up a
tool-tip.</p>
<p><i>Line 16-19:</i> This element is here to tell you about the original feed
that this entry came from; there’s more on it in Mihai’s write-up.
There are a couple of things in it that are weird.
First, there’s that <code>gr:stream-id=</code> attribute.  I think that’s what
the <code>&lt;link rel="self"</code> element is for, and in fact the Feed
Validator warns about that missing link.  The Validator also warns that the
source feed’s <code>updated</code> timestamp is missing.  Actually, I can see
lots of scenarios where it would be OK to ignore those warnings, but since
they’re actually providing the <nobr><code>&lt;link rel="self"</code></nobr>
value, they should put it in the right place.</p>
<p>Also, the <code>id</code> element inside the <code>source</code> is
distinctly strange.  This is supposed to be the required unique
identifier of the Atom feed the entry originally came from.
But it’s not an Atom feed, it’s Engadget’s RSS feed.  So, they made up a
reasonable-looking ID.  It can’t really meet the strict Atom requirements
since it’s obviously not going to be universal; in fact an <i>asshole</i>
might argue that this somehow violates the spec, but they’d be wrong.</p>
<p>Of course, if they do happen to copy in an entry from an actual Atom feed,
they’d better re-use its actual Atom id rather than make one up, or they’d be <i>morons</i>.</p>
<p><i>Lines 18 and 21:</i> They’ve labeled the titles as
<code>type="text"</code> which is the default, so you might want to chop this
if you were bandwidth-constrained.</p>
<p><i>Line 24:</i> Once again, <code>rel="alternate"</code> is the default and
hence not strictly necessary, but the <code>type="text/html"</code> is really
good practice, making it super-easy for software to do the right thing.</p>
<p><i>Line 27:</i> Now this is clever.  They’ve copied in Engadget’s HTML text
and since who knows if it’s well-formed or not, they’ve said
<code>type="html"</code>, escaped it, and furthermore, provided the
<code>xml:base=</code> 
so that any relative links in there are less likely to break.  This is the
work of an <i>angel</i>.</p>

<title>Those Cruel Irish</title>
</head>

<p>People inside Sun were gleefully emailing around
<a href="http://www.stdlib.net/~colmmacc/2006/03/23/niagara-vs-ftpheanetie-showdown/">Colm MacCárthaigh’s
big Niagara benchmark post</a> and I was reading and found myself laughing out
loud.  The synopsis is: it’s a big serious benchmark and the box did great,
pretty well slaughtering both a Dell Xeon and a Dell Itanium.
But jeepers, those Irish dudes are heartless, I’m surprised there weren’t
smoking shards of casing and silicon on the floor.  I think most Apache &amp;
*n*x geeks would find themselves gasping and snickering a bit at Colm’s
write-up, but there’s
some real wisdom there too about filesystem and server tuning and so on,
although some of the tricks are definitely don’t-try-this-at-home.
Anyhow, here are some cute samples:<br/>
“Also, in each case, the system was pretty much unusable by the time we were
done!”<br/>
“... about 83,000 concurrent downloads.”<br/>
<i>[They managed to crash Solaris with the experimental event MPM]:</i> 
“Then again, it was handling about 30,000 requests at the time,
with no accept mutex.”<br/>
“Of course, no server should ever be allowed to get
into that kind of insane territory.”<br/>
“Note: these are stupid values for a
real-world server... really only useful if you are doing some insane
benchmarking and 
testing.”<br/>
“...5718 requests per second.”<br/>

<title>FSS: Hawai’i</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Friday Slide Scan #26 has two twenty-year-old photos from Hawai’i, the Big
Island; unusually for such photography, neither includes the
ocean, nor any flowers, nor any plants even; there’s one non-native animal.
They’re pretty enough, and that island’s in my mind because we’re going to be
spending the a week there starting next Sunday, April 2nd.  If anyone I know
is going to be there too, let’s get together for a Mai Tai.</p>
<p>The first shows one of the few surviving
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heiau">Heiau</a>, ancient Hawai’an
sacred structures.</p>
<img src="0747.jpg" alt="Heiau on the Big Island, Hawai’i" />
<p>The second shows the non-native animal, namely me, standing on one of the
Big Island’s astounding lava fields.</p>
<img src="0734.jpg" alt="Tim Bray on Hawai’ian Big Island lava field." />
<p>Images in the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1953
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/08/11/MomsGarden">Jean Bray</a>, Tim Bray, Cath
Bray, and
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>; when I know
exactly who took one, I’ll say; in this case, the second image is by Cath Bray.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using
a Nikon CoolScan 4000 ED scanner and cleaned up by a combination of the Nikon
scanning software and PhotoShop Elements.</p>

<title>WS-Fritz-Lang</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>You know, I think most people would agree that I’ve written quite enough
about this stuff.  But this one particular WS-piñata swung right into my face,
and I simply can’t resist a whack at it.  In this particular case, I even have
some of the political back-story.  
But first, check out
<a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/specification/ws-roadmap/">Evolving Web services standards for managing system resources</a>
and have a peek at this <em>remarkable</em> PDF white paper:
<a href="http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/dw/webservices/Harmonization_Roadmap.pdf">Toward 
Converging Web Service Standards for Resources, Events, and
Management</a> (both released March 15 by HP, IBM, Intel, and Microsoft).</p>
<p>I read the white paper and was puzzled,
failing to get what was going on.  So I poked around and got an
explanation that runs something like this: One WS-Faction supports WSDM, thus
WS-RF and WS-Notification; the other WS-Management, now at DMTF.  These mostly
do the same thing, I’m told.  Anyhow, somebody said “Why don’t we All Just Get
Along?” and thus this
roadmap on how everything’s going to be harmonized, “over the
next 18-24 months”.</p>
<p>So, brace yourself for heavy convergence.  H/I/I/M will
write some new specifications, WS-Transfer Addendum and WS-ResourceTransfer,
and revise WS-MetadataExchange (which I’ve never quite managed to understand,
but Don Box says it’s at the center of WS-everything, and I trust Don).
Also new will be WS-EventNotification, and another that isn’t yet named yet, “a
forthcoming common Web services management specification”.</p>
<p>However, various subgroups of the H/I/I/M posse are going to be supporting
the existing to-be-superseded and to-be-amended specs in the interim, and are
apparently suggesting, straight-faced, that it might be sane for customers to
use them.</p>
<p>I guess I won’t offer any further commentary on the contents of this
document.  I can’t help but feel for the H/I/I/M staff who are going to have
to do the work, and am reminded of Fritz Lang’s 
immortal
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_%281927_film%29">Metropolis</a>,
where Maria says: “Nobody cared about the slaves who died laboring to raise
the Tower of Babel.”</p>

<p>Earlier this month I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/03/01/Free-Computers">lamented</a> that we
didn’t have much of a process for donating computers to projects that are
doing good things.  We seem to be making some progress on
that, for example the
<a href="http://www.sun.com/emrkt/trycoolthreads/index.html">T2000-tryout
program</a> seems to be running a lot smoother.  But that’s not all; for
example, an X2100 showed up Friday on the doorstep of
<a href="http://www.gnusolaris.org/gswiki#head-df7a7c76f076b1612c7b66d975b8a04a283bf892">Nexenta,
as in GNU/Solaris</a>.
I think that this kind of thing is a complete no-brainer and hope that we
manage to do 
more of it.</p>

<title>Cardiobonara</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We were driving home talking about what to have for dinner, when
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren</a> said “How about Penne
Carbonara?”  I knew that this was some kind of pasta sauce, but somehow I’d
never actually had any.  Well, there are cookbooks.  My goodness
gracious: I thought that America had seized world leadership in the art and
science of coating the insides of your arteries with fatty, greasy,
substances; but I see that the Italians are still the masters.  First, you cut
up a
third of a package of bacon and cook it <em>in olive oil</em>.  Then you’ve
got four eggs, considerable butter, some cream, and a bunch of grated Parmesan.
Cook ’em up in just the right order, toss the pasta in it, and apply great
lashings of fresh-ground black pepper.  
I had lots of red wine in the faint hope that it would mitigate the arterial
damage.
With apologies to all the observant vegan
Jews and Muslims among my readership, 
I have to say it tasted damn good.
<i>[Update: I really have to write that commenting system.

<p><a href="http://blog.morellinet.com/">Massimo Morelli</a> writes from Bologna:</p>
<blockquote><p>A Hint for you and Lauren: the best pasta for Carbonara is Spaghetti (possibly the thickest kind) and not Penne.
Just try.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mike O’Dell counters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>when my Roman best friend taught me to make Carbonara
in his family apartment in The Eternal City, he used large
bucatini because of it has increased surface area without
increased mass: “It holds the sauce much better.”</p>
<p>he also said bucatini is a Roman localization of the dish.
i learned it’s made across Italy with different pasta and other
minor variations.</p>
<p>you can take some solace in the knowledge that the olive oil
is full of heart-friendly oils which mitigate the impact
of the others.</p>
<p>but my Roman friend wrapped it up thusly: when finished,
he leaned back in his chair, cherubic grin on his face and said,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Carbonara is so very fine.”</p></blockquote>
<p>indeed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Dougan adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh, you poor man. Never had Carbonara. It’s a sad, sad world.</p>
<p>Actually it’s not uncommon for people to not have had Carbonara. Most Italian restaurants don’t have it on the menu as you pretty much have to make it fresh. If memory serves from when I was still living in Vancouver, Chianti Cafe and Restaurant near West 4th and Burrard serves it.</p>
<p>If you decide to dig deeper, you’ll find that there are 2 approaches to Carbonara: dry or creamy. Which is better is a matter of preference, but I have seen heated arguments over the question.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mik Lernout writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Also: squeeze some lemon juice over the Carbonara  on your
plate: it pulls the dish up yet another notch.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.jnbridge.com">Wayne Citrin</a> indulges in heresy:</p>
<blockquote><p>You might enjoy a lighter, but somewhat heretical variant—use
smoked salmon instead of bacon.</p>
<p>Other ways to lighten it up:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>don’t use cream</p></li>
<li><p>use fewer eggs.  You can probably get away with two eggs with a pound of
pasta</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Michael Constans deep-dives on pork products:</p>
<blockquote><p>I would like to point out that there is a hierarchy of pork products involved in making Carbonara. </p>
<p>Bacon works in a pinch, but only if stuck someplace where you can’t get
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancetta">Pancetta</a>. But avoid the
packaged slices.  
They are much too thinly sliced for this application.  You want to
get the kind that comes rolled up like a sausage, and then slice it yourself
into battons.</p> 
<p>But the undisputed king is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanciale">Guanciale</a>
Taken from the pig’s jowl it has a
fantastic texture and flavor.  I don’t know where you would find it in
Vancouver, but if you pass through Seattle, you can find it at
<a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/pacificnw/2005/0109/taste.html">Salumi’s</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rafe Colburn, on behalf of his wife really:</p>
<blockquote><p> I am a carbonara lover (I had the best carbonara ever in a
little
Italian place in Boston over by Mass General hospital a few years
ago), but my wife has a version that is, to me, even better.</p>
<p>She buys a whole chunk of slab bacon and cubes it into half inch
cubes, then she puts it in a roasting pan, pours some olive oil and
freshly ground black pepper on it, and roasts it  until it’s brown and
slightly crispy. She makes some spaghettini (thin spaghettini—De
Cecco #11) and puts the freshly made pasta into the roasting pan when
she takes it out of the oven and mixes it all up. The fat from the
bacon and the olive oil make the sauce for the pasta.  Then she puts
some fresh Italian parsley on it, and serves it.</p>
<p>Absolutely magnificent. Think of it as carbonara without the dairy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.thewormbook.com/helmintholog/">Andrew Brown</a>
(check his blog, really) writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>One final trick—this dish has been a favourite of my children
for 25 years now—make it in a wok. Here’s what I do for three people: Take
equal quantities of smoked and unsmoked pork products (pancetta and Kassler is
one great mix) chop them in strips, about matchstick thick and fry them
carefully in olive oil in a capacious wok. While this is going on, beat three
eggs together with salt and pepper, and cook thin pasta—vermicelli is best—to
maximise the surface area. When the pasta is al dente, turn the heat off 
under the wok, drain the pasta, and then dump it into the work, pout over the
beaten egg, and mix all together: the egg cooks in contact with the hot sauce
and pasta. Serve immediately, garnished with parsley.</p>

<title>Styles: Beyond WS and REST</title>

<body>
<p>There’s been a recent mini-flurry around REST and alleged subsets such
as “Lo-REST” and “Hi-REST”.  Initiator:

and <a href="http://lesscode.org/2006/03/19/high-low-rest/">Tomayko</a>.
My thanks to all of them
for keeping this stuff in the front of my mind.  
I’m not sure that 
“Web Services” and “REST” are useful names for the interesting
network-application styles.
But I’m pretty sure I know what those styles are.</p>
<p>I’d really like to write this without using the word “architecture”, which
has been abused long past the pain point.  Roy Fielding calls REST an
“Architectural Style” but I’m not sure that’s an improvement.
I’m going to talk about <i>application styles</i>, or just <i>styles</i>;
shorter is better.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>History</h2>
<p>It might be helpful to remember what the goal is, what we’re
trying to accomplish.  We want to build applications
that work across networks, where the networks have unpredictable scale and
performance and reliability, and the computers in the networks aren’t all the
same.  That’s all.</p>
<p>Since programming frameworks had always been about APIs and
Object Models, the first wave of attempts to build network frameworks,
logically enough, tried to extend those things across the 
network.  It didn’t work that well: those frameworks were hard to understand
and hard to implement and interoperability suffered.</p>
<p>Then, in the first half of the Nineties, there finally was a big complex
information system that extended across the Internet and performed well
and did useful things.  That, of course, was the World Wide Web.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Message Exchange Patterns</h2>
<p>When you look at the Web, you see no APIs and no object models; it’s
protocols all the way down.  The system
is defined by agreements on the sequencing and contents of the messages going
back and forth.  The
agreements 
can be precise (TCP/IP) or sloppy (HTML), they can come from the IETF or the
W3C or ISO, it doesn’t really matter that much; what matters is that messages
are all there is.</p>
<p>What most people call “Web Services” is an application style built
around Message Exchange Patterns (MEPs for short).  
Based on the Web’s success, the idea is hard to argue with.
The mainstream attempt to standardize this style started with XML and XSD
and WSDL, and then plunged headlong down the WS-* path.</p>
<p>I think "MEP Style" or "Message-Exchange Style" would be a better name than
"Web Services".</p> 
<h2 id='p-3'>The Web Style</h2>
<p>When you look at the Web and see past the message-exchange basics, a few
more things leap to the eye: HTTP’s highly-restricted MEP, the
notions that everything is a Resource and identified by a
URI, and the importance of hyperlinks as a general-purpose building block.</p>
<p>What most people call REST is a an application style that shares those basic
Web underpinnings.  Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You have a lot of things in the system, identified by
URIs.</p></li>
<li><p>The protocol (probably HTTP) only knows one MEP: single-request,
single-response, with the request directed at a URI.</p></li>
<li><p>An important subset of the requests, what HTTP calls GET, are
read-only, safe, idempotent.</p></li>
<li><p>You expect to ship a lot of URIs around in the bodies of requests and
responses, and use them in operations that feel like link following.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I think “Web Style” would be a better name than “REST”.  Serious students
of the style will still need to read
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm">Roy’s
dissertation</a>, but I think those bullet points capture the essentials.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Red Herring: Statelessness</h2>
<p>Statelessness isn’t an architectural fundamental, it’s a useful engineering
technique for making distributed systems scaleable.
Lots of Web-style applications keep all sorts of client state on the server
and they work just fine.  Those ones probably won’t scale up to serve 
all of humanity across the Internet, or even a hundred thousand busy
online shoppers, but there are lots of useful apps that don’t
need that kind of scale.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Red Herring: HTTP Verbs</h2>
<p>The notion that you can usefully classify systems according to whether or
not they use HTTP PUT and DELETE is silly.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of operations against a resource in the system: those
that can change its state, and those that can’t.
Operations that remove a resource (DELETE) or replace its
whole content (PUT) are a small and not particularly interesting 
subset of potential state changers.  It’s possible that you can
introduce certain system optimizations by recognizing these up front and
optimizing their routing and so on; plausible even, but unproved in practice,
and unlikely to be a game-changer.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>What To Do?</h2>
<p>I think we should take the “Web Services” label into the jailyard, strap on
a blindfold, give it a last cigarette, and shoot it.  It doesn’t mean much any
more, and to the extent that it does, it’s misleading: WS-* doesn’t have much
of the Web about it.
I don’t have a proposal for a new name for the WS-* style; sorry, but I just
don’t care.</p>
<p>But I know what kind of software I’m interested in: Web-style software.</p>
<p>It’s here today, it works, it’s standards-based, and there’s a huge
opportunity for building tooling and developer support around it.</p>

<title>Second Life</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>My spidey-sense is tingling; I keep hearing things about 
<a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a>, the kinds of
things you hear about something that turns out to be real big.
So far, I don’t really get it, but that doesn’t mean anything.
Read on for a picture of my Second Life persona and some impressions.</p>
<img src="Tim-in-Second-Life.png" alt="Tim Bray’s Second Life avatar" />
<div class="caption"><p>Tim Bray AKA Bengal Solzhenitsyn.</p></div>
<p>The avatar-construction kit is really pretty slick, I have to say.  They
don’t do male pattern baldness very well, but the rest is good.  In real life,
I don’t wear glasses unless I’m reading or staring at a computer, but first of
all, I thought they made Bengal more interesting, and second, well, I
<em>am</em> staring at a computer, really.
I think there’s a lot more scope for creativity in setting up a female avatar.</p>
<p>I go way back on this stuff, I remember when AlphaWorld was new, and hey,
it 
<a href="http://www.activeworlds.com/worlds/alphaworld/">still seems to be
there</a>.</p>
<p>For a quick summary of why 2L is probably more interesting than ΑW could
ever have become, see 
<a
href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/03/27/second-life-is-an-os/">Scoble</a>;
the comments too.</p>
<p>I don’t know, though, like Scoble says, it obviously takes hours to find
your feet, and I don’t have ’em, so for the moment, 2L probably belongs to the
kids who have the time to suss it out.</p>
<p>I built Bengal Solzhenitsyn there a couple of months ago and have only been
back once or twice since.  Whenever I go back, the world is mostly empty,
there are a few people hanging around where you arrive, wearing outlandish
outfits and chatting away about things I don’t understand.  Get out into the
country and it’s built-up but desolate, a brand-spanking-new digital ghost
town.</p>
<p>Also, either the Mac client is lame or a 1.67GHz PowerBook ain’t up to it
or it’s just as klunky and awkward to move around in as any other VR that
isn’t a hotrodded game.</p>
<p>But if the buzz I hear is correct, it’ll get crowded soon.  I imagine that
that
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Jacobs">Jane Jacobs’</a> thinking
on real cities probably works for virtual landscapes: density is good.</p>
<p>Maybe later this summer I can steal a couple of days from working on
technology and do a 2L crash course; if it isn’t a whole lot busier
by then, it’s probably just a fizzle.</p>

<p>The combo rollie/backpack laptop case I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/04/12/LuggageTech">bought two years back</a>
is starting to wear out, and I’ve decided that the rollie feature is not
cost-effective; there are lots of times I can’t use it, and the mechanism adds
weight and bulk while robbing me of space.  So I’ve been poking around looking
for good laptop packs (has to be a pack so I can put a change of clothes in
for my frequent overnighters).  David Weinberger told me that 
<a href="http://www.crumplerbags.com/">Crumpler</a> was a hot name, and in
looking at them I ran across some other interesting candidates via reviews
that said “and the competition is...”
The candidates are the
<a href="http://www.crumpler.ca/cartIndex.php?prodId=99&amp;prodType=Bag&amp;optId=6&amp;catId=5">Crumpler
King Single</a> (that website is totally <em>trying too hard</em>), the

Bag</a>, and the
<a href="http://www.roadwired.com/store/Product.cfm?categoryid=1&amp;Productid=47">RoadWired

Anyone out there got one of these, or want to weigh on on the subject of the
ideal laptop pack?

<blockquote><p>I have a Targus backpack, a model that they don’t make anymore but it’s very
similar to their 15.4" Rogue. It fits my 15" PowerBook like a glove, and the
only time my laptop has been damaged was the time I left it unzipped on
accident and stood up too fast—let’s just say that PowerBooks function well
with bent bottom cases. Other than that, the bag has stood up to some
serious abuse (knocked off tables and desks, etc.) with the PowerBook inside
and the laptop is always unscathed. I’m not sure if they look cool enough,
they’re kind of dowdy, but for my money they’re the best laptop backpacks
around.</p>

be a Northern thing :)

<blockquote><p>I’m a bit of a bag aficionado and I’ve used quite a few in the last 5 years.  I used a Timbuktu plain messenger bag with a Tumi laptop sleeve, a large Crumpler messenger bag (“The Suit”, probably discontinued or renamed) and I’ve finally settled on a Brenthaven backpack.</p>
<p>The Timbuktu back was not really geared for laptop use.  It was really a bike messenger bag.  It was spartan. The shoulder strap didn’t adjust to a long enough position for it to be comfortable to carry in the winter.  That was a while ago so they may have enhanced their product line to make them more friendly</p>
<p>I did not enjoy the Crumpler bag at all. It seemed to be a huge bulky thing that wouldn’t really hold much of anything efficiently. Lot’s of foam padding all over the place and not enough interior pockets to hold loose items like cables, etc.</p>
<p>The
<a href="http://www.brenthaven.com/catalog-backpacks.html">Brenthaven bag</a> is the best.  I found it to be excellent in protecting my 15" Powerbook and storing all the junk that goes along with me.  Unlike the Crumpler it has lots of interior pockets to store cables, pens, notebooks, folios, and other items. It is the inverse of the Crumpler, it seems to hold a lot more than it should for a backpack its size. The construction is superb.  I travel quite a bit and basically live out of this bag.  I’ve abused every strap, zipper, handle and pocket and have not been able to damage it. The only downside with the Brenthaven bag for some is the styling. It’s all black and very plain but think of it as a bag a ninja would (or more appropriately wouldn’t) be seen carrying.

<p><a href="http://allinthehead.com">Drew McLellan</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have the Crumpler Sheep Scarer bag, which I think is one size down from the one you’re looking at. If I was purchasing again, I’d want one slightly bigger for a 15" Powerbook. It fits, but only just and there’s not a lot of room for anything much else once all the essentials (wallet, phone, glasses case, power brick, spare battery et al) are loaded up. So the King Single is probably a good choice.</p>
<p>I can’t speak for the competition, as I’ve not wanted to buy anything else since starting out with Crumpler.</p>
<p>Between the geeky other-half and myself we have I think 9 or 10 Crumpler bags in our household. They’re basically just very well designed and very well made. I’ve found (first hand!) that they do a good job of protecting the contents, have a large number of pockets and equipment loops, and are designed with security in mind (the backpacks can’t be unzipped whilst on your back, for example). Plus they’re just really tough and take daily abuse.</p>
<p>As I say, I’ve no experience of the competition, but I’ve found Crumpler bags to be excellent.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.megginson.com">David Megginson</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I went into a regular mall luggage store and bought a red and black
Swiss Army shoulder bag.  It has a big pocket in the front for clothes
(definitely enough for shirt and undergarments—an extra pair of
pants is a tight fit), a smaller one for toothbrush, etc., a middle
section with dividers for papers, a back, zipper section for the
computer, and a back flat zipper pocket for passport/plane tickets
(tight against your body, to help prevent theft)  There is a separate,
removeable inner portfolio case for the computer with a velcro top and
a couple of Palm-Pilot/cell phone-sized front pockets—I often use
that as a mini briefcase, sans computer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the bag was *so* good that I ended up using it as my
primary flight bag, with headphones and GPS in the computer
compartment, logbooks and charts in the middle section, etc.  My poor
computer is back in its old, threadbare Targus bag.

<blockquote><p>The Tom Bihn bags are excellent.  Be aware that the Brain Bag needs either a Brain Cell or a Monolith sleeve to truly protect your laptop.  I’ve been beating the daylights out of one for a while, with little wear on the bag to show for it.  It would help quite a bit if you said which laptop you are trying to protect, as there are different bags which are more or less suitable depending on the laptop in question.  For my 12" PB, I’ve been using an enCase bag that has been quite good, and it was quite reasonably priced at $55 or so, but my 17" PB doesn’t fit it.

about a year ago.  It’s served me very well, is of good quality, looks cool, and is <em>very</em> comfortable.</p>
<p>I’m tall (2 meters) and this is one of the few ones I’ve found that fit me well.  Well, I did buy the XL version I guess... My advice: try it first.  This is one of those things where you don’t want to choose an uncomfortable bag.</p>
<p>Bought at a bike shop, after a month of indecision about the thousands of
bags you can choose from.  It’s religious.  Don’t go down that path ;-)</p>
<p>PS.  Note that you have to take the bag off of your shoulders to get inside
because of the way the shoulder straps are mounted about the zip - I love this
design...</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>I’m responding to your search for a laptop bag (http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/03/29/Bags). I have owned and used the same Tom Bihn Brain Bag since ’99, and I love it. I can’t recommend it highly enough. It’s indestructable, has the right number of pockets, and holds everything I need.</p>
<p>I have the appropriate Brain Cell padding/insert for my laptop (three different sizes over the years), and also have a cable bag called the Snake Charmer and an older version of the Freudian Slip insert for the other side that holds papers, pens, iPod, etc.</p>

<blockquote><p>I’m not sure I see any that are as good as the one I’ve got.
It’s an older Eagle Creek (no longer made) with a laptop
sleeve, the standard pencils+checkbook+crap pocket area,
and an outermost pocket for music/Sun badge etc, plus a
sort of kangaroo pocket on the outside that right now happens
to have a packaged iPod in it, but is also capable of
stretching to accommodate a bicycle helmet (the music
pocket is full of crap and needs to be cleaned out so
the iPod can go back in).</p>
<p>Very functional, very comfortable, getting a little
frayed.  I’ve used it since about November 2002, and
I plan to keep repairing it for a while longer.</p>
<p>For no particular reason, I am partial to Tom Bihn.

my Nikon D-70 plus related stuff, and have been exceptionally happy with it.
We toted it around Venice for 5 days, and it was comfortable on my shoulder,
the strap was long enough for my tall frame and was spacious for its size. I
bought mine locally at
<a href="http://www.beauphoto.com/">Beau Photo</a> on West 6th
just off Granville. I didn’t notice if they specifically had laptop bags,
but it might be worth calling them.</p>
<p>And indeed, the Crumpler website is both insane and useless. Cheers. DB.

<blockquote><p>I’ve been a long time devotee of Bihn’s bags, having started buying
them in early ’90s (okay, really just 2 bags in that time period, they
last forever!).  With integrated Brain Cell, I feel totally
comfortable sling my my Brain Bag around and not worrying about my
laptop.</p>
<p>That said, the Brain Bag is both fricking huge (though it cinches
down), and kind of dorky looking.  And for something that big, I
always want to be able to transform it into an overnight bag, for
which I personally require external straps for gear (e.g. tripod, or
sleeping pad).  Sadly Brain Bag lacks any options for doing this.</p>
<p>I also carry a Chrome bag, which while cool looking is *not*
comfortable if you have an even moderately long torso and spend most
of your time walking vs. biking.</p>
<p>Can’t speak to the Crumplers, their website is too cute by half, and
has always made me doubt the quality of their product.

<blockquote><p>You were asking about feedback regarding you bag decision.</p>
<p>I personally have a ID by Tom Bihn with the matching brain cell for my PowerBook since 2 years. I really love this bag, everything I have to lug around fits in, e.g. power adapter, iPod, digital camera, iSight and various cables. What is in my opinion the most worthy on this bag is the protection to your laptop from the Brain Cell. Suspending the laptop in a foam sling with a corrugated shell is the best protection I have seen. This is a similar design to the Brenthaven bags.</p>
<p>So I would pick the Brain Bag or the Super Ego.</p>
<p>The Crumpler bags are also really cool and probably a little more stylish then the Bihn design, but the does not provide so good protection. I would probably by an additional sleeve for the laptop.</p>
<p>I hope you find a bags that suits you.</p>

<blockquote><p>At this point you may be sick of hearing from folks on the topic, but I’ve used gear from both of the companies you mentioned.</p>
<p>Crumpler: I carried a “Wack-o-Phone” for two years. It wears well, and I could carry my 15" Powerbook, cords, iSight, pens and all. The laptop pocket’s well padded. I’ve dropped the bag onto concrete by accident a couple of times, with no harm done.</p>
<p>Drawbacks: there’s hardly room for more than a paperback book. No good way to carry papers unless you stick them in the laptop pocket. It’s a shoulder bag. I can’t carry one for long periods without suffering.</p>
<p>Clever bits: there’s a reinforced loop at either end of the zipper. Useful for attaching a laminated buisness card or a small flashlight on a lanyard. Elise Mattheson (http://lioness.net/) made me a nifty charm out of a pewter monkey and glass beads that I hung from one. Crumpler sells a phone/camera pouch that attaches to one side of the bag.</p>
<p>Tom Bhim: I bought the Brain Bag + Brain Cell + Freudian Slip + Snake Charmer two weeks ago. I love the Freudian Slip. Easy to pull it up and get to my iPod, headphones, copies of agenda for meetings, etc. Still working on the best strategy for stowing things. I can put books inside! And after putting away my technology bits, there’s enough room for my shaving kit, shirt packer, and other clothing for at least a long weekend trip. Carrying this and a roll-aboard suitcase, I could do several weeks away.</p>
<p>Drawbacks: it’s big. No good place to put my camera (Cannon PowerShot.) Lots of dangly straps.</p>
<p>Clever bits: The shoulder straps come with the clip to cross connect them, cinching them closer together so the bag rides better on your shoulders. Zipper pouch at the top with a lanyard for keys. Snarky joke, in French, on the care tag.</p>

<p>Friday Slide Scan #27, like
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/03/24/FSS">#26</a>, has two twenty-year-old photos from Hawai’i,
the Big Island; but unlike last week, these are ordinary pretty-plant pictures.
Like last week, I picked them because we’re going to be
spending the a week there, leaving tomorrow, April 1.  If anyone I know
is going to be there too, let’s get together for a Mai Tai.</p>
<p>Frankly, I can’t remember where these were taken or any details about the
plants; there is no shortage of lovely vegetation on the islands.</p>
<img src="0815.jpg" alt="Hawai’an vegetation - pink blossoms" />
<img src="0816.jpg" alt="Hawai’an vegetation - palm fronds" />
<p>Images in the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1953
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>,

Bray, and
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>; when I know
exactly who took one, I’ll say.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using
a Nikon CoolScan 4000 ED scanner and cleaned up by a combination of the Nikon
scanning software and PhotoShop Elements.</p>

<p>Hey,
<a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/download/jdiskreport/jdiskreport.jnlp">this
is cool</a>; it’s a little doo-hickey that draws pie charts and graphs of what
you’ve got on your disk.
I wonder on what set of hardware/OS combinations the web-start Just 
Works like it did on my Mac?  The pie-charts of my life were so cool I
had to publish a few.  And I turned up a real problem, too.</p>
<p>It took well over five minutes to crawl through my home directory, which I
guess isn’t too bad for 35G.</p>
<img src="home.png" alt="Tim’s home directory via JDiskReport" />
<p>If you click on the shattered-pie-chart glyph at the bottom, you get this,
you can mouse-over the picture to get the details.</p>
<img src="home-fanout.png" alt="Tim’s home directory via JDiskReport, detail" />
<p>Let’s drill down a little.  I wonder if I’m
going to be able to go on carrying around every picture I’ve ever taken?</p>
<img src="pictures.png" alt="Tim’s picture directory via JDiskReport" />
<p>The Music listing surprised me; I’d have thought the biggest chunks
would be Bach and Ry Cooder.  But then I realised that I ripped a lot
of that stuff to MP3 not lossless, back before I got smart.  Since I listen
mostly on the plane, no biggie I suppose.</p>
<img src="music.png" alt="Tim’s music directory via JDiskReport" />
<p>How about the miserable publication you are now reading?</p>
<img src="ongoing.png" alt="Tim’s ongoing directory via JDiskReport" />
<p>Yes, well, I do have compressed versions of every logfile since the dawn of
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> time.  “Write” is where I, you know, write; the
source code if you will, two-thirds of a gig so far.  
Yow, a check on the production version over
at tbray.org shows only 542M, that’s a 100M of stuff that I wrote or captured
but never published.  See, it could be worse.</p>
<p>Let’s check out some of the detail listings.  What are the largest
files I have?</p>
<img src="big-files.png" alt="Biggest files in Tim’s directory, via JDiskReport" />
<p>So, my inbox is the biggest single object.  Reasonable, I suppose... hold
on a dag-blaggin’ second.  Last-modified March 2004?  That’s my old Mozilla
mail directory;
I haven’t used it since I joined Sun and discovered Mail.app would talk to our
IMAP servers.  Well, kiss
that puppy goodbye.</p>
<p>That half-gig <code>data.db2.x....</code> thingie?  Yep, the second
line is Second Life, the cache I guess; and I hardly ever play.  Yow.</p>

<title>Scoble’s Bad Month</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I don’t always agree with
<a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/">Scoble</a>, but the man doesn’t
have an ounce of malice, near as I can tell.  
I think that, by and large, he towers over the
people who’ve been giving him a hard time, and I’d advise him to tune ’em out
unless they’re really adding value.  
To address a couple just in the last
week: Note to Vogels@Amazon: There’s a word for
companies that base all decisions on ruthless quantitative ROI metrics:
Bankrupt. I’m an engineer and value numbers, but in business, sometimes
anecdotal evidence is all you’ve got, and the anecdotal evidence that blogging
produces good results for some companies is pretty voluminous.  You don’t want
to hear it, that’s your privilege; me, I tend to want to consider all the
inputs.
Note to Nick Carr: This
<a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2006/03/lame_but_smart.php">perils
of blogging piece</a> is really poorly considered.  Carr introduces his lengthy
list of Things That Can Go Wrong with “Last year, the San Francisco law firm
Howard Rice provided a useful overview of the legal risks inherent in employee
blogging”.  As a thought experiment, replace the word “blogging” with “email”
or “conference presentation” or “teleconference” or “sales presentation”.
Or “barroom conversation” for that matter.
Quick, quick, you wanna be safe, you better lock all your employees up and
never let ’em say anything to anyone!  
The point is that
qualitatively, blogging requires no new policies and introduces no new risks.
If your employees are going to say stupid things in public, you’ve got a
management problem and a policy problem, not a blogging problem.
Note to executives who are frightened of hearing what their
employees have to say, or finding out what the world really thinks about their
company:
Carr has done you a real favor.  Just go and ask your attorneys if they think
blogging is safe, and slip ’em a copy of that list, and you can rest easy
knowing you’ll never hear anything uncomfortable.</p>

<body>
<p>That would be
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.S._Bach">J. Sebastian Bach</a> and 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_the_Great">Frederick</a> II
Hohenzollern (AKA the Great) of Prussia, who 
famously met in 1747. The King proposed a Royal Theme and asked Bach to
extemporize fugally; Bach did so on the spot, somewhat, and a few weeks later
sent Frederick
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Musical_Offering">The Musical
Offering</a>.  This episode appeared at the beginning of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%2C_Escher%2C_Bach">Gödel,
Escher, Bach</a>, and now finds itself at the center of another book:
<cite>Evening in the Palace of Reason</cite> by James R. Gaines, of whom I’d
never previously heard.  It’s pretty good; read on for some remarks on
the book, Frederick, Sebastian, and the <cite>Offering</cite>.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Bach</h2>
<p>There’s really not that much new to learn about Bach, but I think Bach
newbies would enjoy Gaines’ narrative, and this Bach obsessive did too.
If you want to read one book about Bach, that would be <cite>The Bach
Reader</cite>, which collects every word Bach is known to have written and
adds some excellent supporting and historical material.</p>
<p>It might not be nuts
to recommend this book as the second.
But only for those who know the music
pretty well; Gaines, for example is apt to give you twenty paragraphs on the
Meaning of the big harpsichord cadenza in Brandenburg 5 without actually
describing it for 
those who don’t know it; if you don’t know it, go get a recording of the
Brandenburgs and play #5 really loud.  The cadenza is kind of like something
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Van_Halen">Eddie van Halen</a>
would have played if he’d lived in the 18th century and didn’t have
electricity.  I dunno what it means but it’s fun to listen to.</p> 
<h2 id='p-2'>Frederick</h2>
<p>On the other hand, before reading this book I knew pretty well nothing
about Frederick other that he played the flute, enlarged Prussia, and met
Bach.
It turns out he was an interesting—not nice, not likable, but
interesting—character.  Probably more so than Bach, who was prickly,
thin-skinned, and litigious.  Anyhow, Gaines has a
lot of fun telling Frederick’s story, spending time on his relationship with
his awful father,
his sexuality (metro- at least), and his world-view, and I had a lot of fun
reading it.
I think I should track down a good big thick book 
on Frederick (this volume is fairly slender) and learn more.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>The Musical Offering</h2>
<p>People who write about this piece of music, including Hofstadter and
Gaines, tend to be reduced to fannish gurgling.  They have a point.   It’s not
flashy like that Brandenburg nor thunderous like the big organ showpieces, nor
does it contain either the huge vaulting curves of the big choral works or
the raw howls of emotion from the cello suites.  But you
can listen to it as long as you want and you’ll keep hearing more, it’s deep,
deep, deep.</p>
<p>My favorite recording for some decades has been by Neville Marriner and
the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields, which makes few concessions to
historical correctness, but on the other hand is perfect, approximately.
The version I have is on a double CD paired with <cite>The Art of the
Fugue</cite>, another fine performance.</p>
<p>But as I type this I’m listening to a version by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordi_Savall">Jordi Savall</a> and the
<i>Le Concert des Nations</i>, which my brother gave me for Christmas this
year and I’m just now listening to seriously.  I like it a lot, I may have to
give it twenty or thirty more listens to decide if it holds up.
You can do that with this piece of music, it just doesn’t wear out.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>The History</h2>
<p>It’s pretty sad.  There’s evidence of family malice
afoot in the theme that Frederick proposed, and then there’s no evidence that
Frederick ever actually listened to <cite>The Offering</cite>, and it’s clear
that Bach got more or less nothing either for his long trip or for writing the
music.  He may never have heard it either.</p>
<p>Whatever.  Thanks, Sebastian and Fred.</p>

<p>On this vacation, given that Lauren is seven months pregnant, we picked
something that was low-stress and low-adventure (starting with the location;
there’s a direct Vancouver-to-Kona flight).  I like lounging by the pool
and sampling the local beverages as much as anyone, but with a deadline-free
week, I also found time for some recreational programming.  The result is
something I call “Framer”, which generates borders and/or drop shadows for
images in 
most popular formats.  It writes PNGs with variable alpha channel
so the drop shadows will look OK on any color background.  It has some
options and you’re free to use it, but it’s not problem-free and unless
there’s a lot of interest I’m not going to open-source it.
Illustrated with groovy Big Island sunset photos.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Getting and Using It</h2>
<p>Download the JAR
<a href="/ongoing/code/framer/Framer.jar">here</a> and the Javadocs tarball 
<a href="/ongoing/code/framer/jd.tgz">here</a>.
No warranties, in fact I’m sure some input files and combinations of options
will make it blow chunks; you have been warned.
To figure out the arguments and defaults, 
type <nobr><code>java -jar Framer.jar -help</code></nobr>,
or look at the Javadocs (Java 1.5 required).
You can change the color and thickness of the border and drop-shadow.
The defaults look like the pictures here at <span class='o'>ongoing</span>:</p>
<img src="IMG_4635.jpg" alt="Big Island sunset from South Kohala" />
<h2 id='p-4'>Why I Did It</h2>
<p>Well,the little random picture in the right margin has been drop-shadowed
for a couple of years, using the List Apart CSS technique augmented by
professional help from Dave Shea; that story
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/03/10/WhoYaGonnaCall">here</a>).</p>
<p>I’ve wanted the photos I showpiece in the mainline of the stories 
shadowed as well, but the ALA/Shea technique interacted toxically with the
rest of the layout,
and trying to debug it led down a maze of twisty little CSS passages, all
different.</p>
<p>Poking around the Web produced lots of commentary along the lines of “You
should be able to do this with ImageMagick”, or by scripting the Gimp or
PhotoShop, but nowhere did I find an actual example of something I could wire
into the Perl script that publishes <span class='o'>ongoing</span>.</p>
<p>So, I thought, how hard can it be?  And indeed, it wasn’t too hard.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Status</h2>
<p>As of now, all the drop shadows you see here at 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> are courtesy of Framer.
I’m actually kind of glad to be getting rid of the CSS drop shadows, which
were at best a hack; it’s a reasonable thing to want to be able to do
picture-decoration in a stylesheet, I think but if you want to do that, CSS
should provide something like:</p>
<pre><code>img { shadow: 8px 315deg #003434; }</code></pre>
<p>Anyhow, Framer does what I need here at <span class='o'>ongoing</span>,
and in the short term I need to turn my attention back to my real-world
deliverables.  If other people want to use Framer, and if other people are
getting bit by its shortcomings, well then maybe some more work is called for.</p>
<p>In which case I really ought to slap an OSS license on it, but because I
happen to work for maybe the world’s largest publisher of open-source
software, that means that There Are Procedures, and I’d rather avoid
doing the work for 493 lines of Java, the damn license boilerplate would
probably double the size of the code.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Problems</h2>
<p>It’s painfully slow.  First you have to start a JVM (so you should do lots
of pictures at once), and
then Framer burns way too long for even a modest picture.
For some reason NetBeans here on my Mac doesn’t include the profiler (Not
available?  Download required?), so I don’t yet know why
it’s slow.</p>
<p>The variable shadow depth doesn’t work all that well; when you make it too
big, it looks gross not only because drop shadows should be modest in size,
but because the shadowed corners are at a funny (funny as in wrong) angle.</p>
<p>You should be able to select the shadow angle, right now it’s illuminated
from the top left which is the typical default in most graphics packages but
it should be variable and I thought I’d figured out how to do that but it’s
harder than I thought, so maybe someday.</p>
<p>The drop shadows aren’t as polished, if you look real close, as those
produced by actual professional graphics programs written by actual
professional graphics programmers who understand the theory.  The fall-off in
shadow darkness (really a fall-off in PNG alpha) isn’t quite feathery enough,
and the shading in the corners is really kind of kludgy.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Why Java?</h2>
<p>Because I’d already used Java’s <code>java.awt.image.BufferedImage</code>
and <code>java.imageio.ImageIO</code> APIs, and since those are core APIs, I
could go on vacation and be sure that everything I needed would be on the
laptop.</p>
<p>That <code>ImageIO</code> library is really first-rate, unusually
for Java it’s fairly abstraction-free and automated: “Here’s the name of a file
I claim contains an image, please go read it and either give me a
<code>BufferedImage</code> or toss me an exception.”</p>
<p>If you want to draw rectangles efficiently, there are some abstractions you
have to soak up, but since it has a <nobr><code>SetRGB(x, y,
color)</code></nobr> method, who needs ’em?  Hmm, maybe that’s why it’s
slow.</p>
<img src="IMGP3105.jpg" alt="Palm trees, drop-shadowed" />
<h2 id='p-6'>Math Fun</h2>
<p>Well, I blew up the drop-shadows produced by a couple of my fave graphics
apps, and the way the darkness falls off is subtly nonlinear.  In
fact, I couldn’t spot the pattern, so I looked at the differences in color
values between successive lines in the shadow, and those delta values looked
not unlike a parabola; so I asserted that they were sorta kinda like a
derivative and integrated it and got a cubic function that actually 
produces a drop-off not unlike the pros use.  But it could still be
better.</p>
<p>It’s also possible that repeatedly computing a 
double-precision cubic polynomial is a suboptimal way
of generating 8-bit alpha-channel values.  Do ya <em>think</em>?</p>
<p>And the way that the pro programs do the drop-shadows on the corners is
still better than Framer’s, my attempts to bend those polynomial parameters
around a corner are pretty ugly inside.</p>

<title>The Big Island</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’m good at vacationing; sleep a couple hours extra every night, lose all
ambition, disconnect from work.  Here are some photos from the
Big Island, which is a good vacation spot, and remarks on: palm trees, resort
maintenance and economics, bad clothing, lava, the size of things,
where to buy fish, beer, flying with the kid, weather forecasts, Kailua-Kona
and sea turtles.</p> 
<h2 id='p-1'>Palms</h2>
<p>I grew up among them, monstrous Mediterranean date palms not these swaying
slender Pacific coconut-growers.  It dawns on me that a defining
adaptation of these island survivors is wind tolerance.  It blows here most
days of the year, and the trees are moving always, their trunks but especially
their fronds, twisting and tossing and still photosynthesizing like mad every
day the sun shines, which is pretty well every day.</p>
<img src="IMGP3163.jpg" alt="Palm Frond at Pu’uhonua O Hanaunau (City of Refuge) National Park" />
<p>That’s a palm frond from Pu’uhonua O Hanaunau (City of Refuge) National
Park, for my money the #1 Big Island tourist attraction that’s not an active
volcano.  Not only is it historically impressive and very beautiful, it has
one of the world’s greatest picnic areas, from whence this:</p>
<img src="IMGP3136.jpg" alt="Palms at Pu’uhonua O Hanaunau (City of Refuge) National Park" />
<h2 id='p-2'>Resort Maintenance and Economics</h2>
<p>The resort we stayed at was lovely, and the first thing that struck my eye
was how incredibly well-maintained all the lawns and gardens and buildings and
trees were.  There’s a downside; during working hours, there’s almost always a
powerful noisy machine of some sort in operation, keeping everything spic and
span.  Can you have one without the other?</p>
<p>We picked up a real-estate magazine for idle entertainment, and were
flabbergasted to read that the units like the one we were staying in 
(OK, with better views) were
going for US$2.1M.  Not only that, but given the number of staff
running powerful noisy machines, the maintenance charges must be fierce.
Based on what we were paying, I wouldn’t recommend a high-end Big Island
condo as an investment property.  Might be a decent place to live though.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Bad Clothing</h2>
<p>Fat people on vacation who rent an SUV to drive from the resort to the
liquor store, and who wear PGA-branded golf styles at all times... well, maybe
they engage in philanthropy on a grand scale
and are generally wonderful people.  But it’s hard to avoid reflective
retching.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Lava</h2>
<p>Everyone knows that the islands are volcanoes, ranging from brand-new to
nicely worn down.  The Big Island is at the brand-new end of things, which
means that a lot of the landscapes are covered with lava.
It’s actually pretty visually interesting up close.</p>
<img src="IMGP3143.jpg" alt="Big Island lava, close-up" />
<img src="IMGP3145.jpg" alt="Big Island lava, close-up" />
<h2 id='p-6'>The Size of Things</h2>
<p>That lava piles up slowly, but it piles up, and after a few million years
you get mountains.  The local boosters will tell you that Mauna Kea is
the world’s largest, if you measure up from the ocean floor where it
starts.  That measurement seems a little strained, but it’s big all right.
In fact, the above-the-waterline parts of the Hawai’ian volcanoes 
are, I would say, about the largest things that the human mind can perceive
directly.  I mean, we all know that there are bigger things: the
land-mass of Canada, the Earth, Jupiter, the Sun, the Milky Way, the Local
Group of galaxies... but you have to take those things on faith, you can’t
stand there and look at them with the naked eye.</p>
<p>Most times, you can’t really see the volcanoes all at once, either; but on
the Big Island, you’re always aware of an endless slope in the
background, down to the ocean and up, usually, into the clouds; except for the
rare days when you see almost the whole thing. Also you can drive up their
sides, measure them with your wheels and feet, not just your eyes.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of shots that show what I mean, both taken from the
<i>Kipuka</i> (a hill surrounded by a lava flow) at the Kipuka Pu’u Huluhulu
nature reserve just off the Saddle Road, which is a very fine picnic spot.
See that sloping line in the background?  I’m not sure the picture makes it
clear enough that it’s miles and miles away.
Also check out the layered lava between us and the mountain.</p>
<img src="IMGP3178.jpg" alt="View towards Mauna Loa from a hill on the Big Island Saddle Road" />
<img src="IMGP3191.jpg" alt="View towards Mauna Loa from a hill on the Big Island Saddle Road" />
<p>OK, you want pictures of the whole thing?  Here’s a shot from last year’s
vacation in Maui, from the top of <em>its</em> big volcano, Haleakala, showing
Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa across the water; those clouds casting the little
shadows aren’t little clouds at all.  You’ll want to enlarge that one for
proper effect.</p>
<img src="IMGP1508.jpg" alt="The volcanoes of the Big Island seen from Maui" />
<h2 id='p-7'>Fish</h2>
<p>Here’s a tiny little traveler’s tip: if you stop in Kawaihae, something
you wouldn’t normally do, there’s a little strip mall at the highway
intersection, and across the street is the Lauu Fish Market, totally
unpretentious, and they sold me something they called “Grey Snapper” that was
ultra-tasty fried up after a little garlic-and-oyster-sauce marinade
treatment.</p>
<h2 id='p-11'>Beer</h2>
<p>I can unequivocally recommend the 
<a href="http://www.konabrewingco.com">Kona Brewing Company</a>, in
particularly their Fire Rock pale ale.  It’s an excellent beer in the bottle,
but if you can find it on draught it’s up there with the world’s finest.
I speak as a serious beer snob and former home brewer.</p>
<p>On the way to the airport heading home, we had dinner at the company’s
brewpub in Kailua, where the food is quite nice, it’s a pity about the
overly-loud leaden-oldies music being played through bad speakers.
Anyhow, we chatted up the folk there and found out that bottling on the island
is uneconomic, so the “Fire Rock IPA” you buy in bottles is actually brewed
and put there by the Widmer brewery in Oregon.  Which is one of America’s
better breweries, but it seems kind of weird to be selling the draught and
bottled product under the same name.</p>
<h2 id='p-9'>Flying With the Kid</h2>
<p>He’ll turn seven this summer, and he’s not afraid of water, so I’m
teaching him to snorkel, and he kind of got it this time.  We held hands and
floated together over some astounding corals and a day-glo fish menagerie; he
enjoyed it so much it didn’t bother him that the water, crystal-clear on this
part of the South Kohala coast, was twenty feet deep.</p>
<p>Snorkeling in clear water, it’s about as close as you’ll come to flying
the way it is in your dreams.  It’s a memory I’ll hang onto.</p>
<h2 id='p-10'>Weather Forecasts</h2>
<p>I don’t know why they bother.  On any given Big Island day you can get soggy
in a Kona hillside downpour, pick up a cancer-downpayment sunburn
half an hour downhill at the City of Refuge park, and freeze your butt off on
an exposed Saddle Road turnout.  On the radio they call it “weather”, but it’s
not like anywhere else.</p> 
<h2 id='p-12'>Kailua-Kona</h2>
<p>The main city on the west side of the Big Island is called Kailua, the
district is Kona, so “Kailua-Kona” is common.  Don’t go there.  There are nice
places in the mountains behind the town, but the town itself is a loveless,
greasy, T-shirt-shop-infested waste of space.  The area north of town was
cruddy and ugly even before they started the construction activities, which
aren’t improving things, and the airport fits in just fine; given beauty all
around, it’s remarkable how much concentrated ugliness can be created in the
ongoing project to make all air travel as unpleasant as possible.</p>
<h2 id='p-8'>Sea Turtles</h2>
<p>Here’s some good news: they’re coming back to land.
We found this out on our own hotel beach, we were loafing in the shade at the
back and Lauren said “there’s a turtle coming out of the water”.  A crowd of
human beachgoers gathered pretty quick, but not as quick as the staff member
who was there with the orange cones to mark off space around it.
The staff guy told me she was female and 
a regular enough visitor that the ladies had named her “Robin”.  
She went to sleep and the tourists eventually melted
away, then it was just an ordinary holiday beach only with a huge sea
turtle snoozing over to one side.  Everyone respected the cones except for 
one kid chasing an overthrown football, but the turtle didn’t seem to
mind a squealing ten-year-old zooming through her space.</p>
<p>There were two more pulled out sunbathing on the resort’s boat
ramp most days, and a sign at the City of Refuge park noting that the turtles
were returning to the beaches there, and asking the visitors to make space for
them.</p>
<p>Then, the last day, in one last time with the kid, we’d just taken off
our snorkels for a quick dip before the showers, nobody else
swimming, and suddenly there was a
huge dark shape in the water between us and the beach. A panicky moment later
I saw the shell and flippers, and just as the kid turned to see, the head came
up and we got a long leathery look before she slipped away to sea.</p>

<title>5✭♫: Francesca da Rimini</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is an twenty-odd-minute orchestral suite
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesca_da_Rimini_%28Tchaikovsky%29">written in 1876</a> by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tchaikowsky">Tchaikowsky</a>.  It’s
intensely romantic, ridiculously melodic, and should be played really,
<em>really</em> loud.
<i>(“5✭♫” series introduction <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music">here</a>;
with <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music#p-1">an
explanation</a> of why the title may look broken.)</i></p>
<img src="Tchaikowsky.png" class="inline" alt="Tchaikowsky" />
<h2 id='p-1'>The Context</h2>
<p>I don’t know any bad Tchaikowsky music.  He doesn’t cover the waterfront,
or try to; what you get are deeply-felt large-scale heavily-orchestrated
showpieces that start strong, are stuffed with hummable tunes, and
end—always—with a bang.  But if that’s what you’re in the mood for, nobody’s
ever done it better.</p>
<p>(There’s an interesting music-obsessive discussion lurking here: not all
great musicians have been good at endings.  Tchaikowsky was, 
Bach was only OK, Brahms is way
better than Beethoven, and back in the 20th century, the Clash were unequaled
among rock bands in bringing a tune to convincing, and interesting,
close.)</p>
<p>Tchaikowsky was a very interesting person: high-strung, obsessive, gay,
hard to get along with; I think the great book about him still hasn’t been
written.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Music</h2>
<p>I’d say that <cite>Francesa</cite> is the first movement of the best
symphony Tchaikowsky never wrote.
I’m not going to get into a big long end-to-end description, except to say
that it has as many beautiful melodies as three average Beethoven symphonies,
wonderful writing for strings and percussion, and is never boring for a single
second of its twenty-plus minutes.</p>
<p>Apparently the music is about the story of the famed star-crossed adulterer
of the same name as told by Dante in the <cite>Inferno</cite>, and while I’ve
read that, I don’t remember the story and I don’t think I’m missing
anything.</p>
<p>Also, this is classical music’s analogue of <cite>London Calling</cite> or
<cite>Made in Japan</cite>; music that just simply can’t be played too loud.
You need an good stereo, because stringed instruments played
loud <i>en masse</i> are maybe the single greatest challenge to electronic
music reproduction.
But this thing ought to be played at a volume where the loud bits are making
the house shake.  Turn it up until you’re frightened and then turn it up some
more.</p>
<p>The recording I listen to is from 1959 by Dorati and the Minneapolis
orchestra on Mercury (catalogue 434 373-2), which also
has very good versions of Tchaikowsky’s <cite>Symphony No. 4</cite> (that’s
what’s advertised on the front for some reason) and Borodin’s <cite>Prince
Igor</cite>.  
It’s one of the “Mercury Living Presence” recordings, which are audiophile
legends, recorded in <em>three</em> channels on half-inch-wide tape by Wilma
Cozart; many lovers of fine recording feel that Ms Cozart’s work in this era
has never been improved on.
There is a certain amount of tape hiss, but once Piotr gets his musical hooks
into you, you’ll never hear it.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Sampling It</h2>
<p>There’s no useful way to “sample” a 20-plus-minute work.  If you like the
sound of an orchestra and like good tunes, you’ll like this.
Otherwise not.</p>
<p>I see that there’s a
<a href="http://www.mercurylivingpresence.com/">Mercury Living Presence</a>
Web site, and they advertise a CD set of all the Tchaikowsky symphonies, which
includes <cite>Francesca</cite>; it looks like the CD I have is out of print.
While I suspect that any competent orchestra and conductor will do OK with this
one, it would be a pity to get a recording that’s not technically good,
because Piotr’s orchestration really deserves the best treatment.</p>

<i>Item:</i> I wanted to do something nice for another well-known

that PHP5 runs slower than PHP4 on the T2000, which makes no
damn sense at all, a key advantage of PHP is that it’s shared-nothing, as in
horizontal scaling, as in, that chip should eat it for breakfast. 
So I had a talk with
<a href="http://andigutmans.blogspot.com/">Andi Gutmans</a> over at 
<a href="http://www.zend.com">Zend</a>

or it may require some work, but we’ll crack that nut one way or another.

<title>Canada on Rails</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>As I was picking up my badge from the slinky black-cocktail-dress-wearing
women (huh?) at the registration desk, this guy came running up saying “We’re
sold out!  Don’t sell any more!”
And
<a href="http://www.canadaonrails.com/">the conference</a> was packed, all right.
Herewith notes on DHH’s keynote, the crowd, and BDD from Dave Astels.</p>
<img src="IMG_4645.jpg" alt="David Heinemeier Hansson speaking to Canada on Rails" />
<h2 id='p-5'>DHH’s Keynote</h2>
<p>David Heinemeier Hansson is rude and arrogant.  At least that’s what he
claimed in his keynote, displaying the dictionary definition of “arrogant” and
saying “Well, yes”; then the next slide said “Fuck You”.
We’ll see; some find humility naturally, others have it thrust upon them, and
some remain arrogant into their graves, which are then rarely visited.
Only having conversed with David once, for about thirty seconds, I have no
personal opinion as to whether he’s just putting it on for effect.</p>
<p>Aside from that, the keynote was light-hearted, well-crafted, and
informative.
He started with some quantitative cheerleading: there have been half a million
Rails downloads (3 are me), forty thousand copies of the
<a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/title/rails/">Agile Web
Development With Rails</a> book have been sold, and there are 16 or so more
books on the way.</p>
<p>Correctly, I think, DHH argued that the friendliness and ease-of-use
of
<a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems/">RubyGems</a> (compared, say,
to CPAN) is a major factor in Rails’ success.</p>
<p>Before getting into the “Where To” part of the speech, he spent some time
on where they’re <em>not</em> going.  He offered
<a href="http://openacs.org/">OpenACS</a> and
<a href="http://www.zope.org/">Zope</a> as examples of things he doesn’t want
Rails to be like.  Because, he says, they have a culture of thinking that
software development is painful, unpleasant, and should be avoided.
He doesn’t want Ruby to become a framework for gluing together chunks of
business behavior.  Hmm, some people think that’s what most programming
is.</p>
<p>David spent some time being hostile to internationalization, saying he
didn’t really see it as part of the shared infrastructure, and similarly to
“components”.  I have no idea what he means by component, and the word doesn’t
exactly explain itself.
As for internationalization, I <em>hope</em> I
didn’t understand what he meant, because I’ve always thought of that as
something that really needs to be in the shared infrastructure, just because
people should be forced to deal with it up front, rather than (much more
painfully) later.  You could say I’m opinionated on the subject and I think
software should be, too.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>WS-? and REST</h2>
<p>David had a terrific slide, with the characters “WS-” followed by a picture
of the <cite>Star Wars</cite> Deathstar; get it?  Not bad, not bad at all.
However, the Rails guys are very interested in wiring things together in the
REST style, using HTTP as a glue.
I’d transcribe paragraphs and paragraphs of his argument, but you’ve read it
all before here, I basically agreed with every word.  More on this below.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>What Next?</h2>
<p>They’re working on Rails 1.1.x and would like to have 1.2.0 out before the
end of the year, and will do 2.0.0 at some unspecified future time.
Their development philosophy is simple: DHH considers himself as the example
of the developer he’s trying to reach; thus he works on solving the problems
that he has in a fashion pleasing to him.
While he frequently calls out to
DRY and C-over-C and so on, the real decision procedure is obviously what
feels right to the Rails group.
I don’t see anything wrong with this; it seems to be
working.</p>
<p>One interesting principle though: they want Rails to be for “Small teams
doing big things.”  There’s a worthy goal.  Mind you, almost all the big
things ever have been done, initially at least, by small teams.</p>
<p>Another: “Rails is a big collection of solutions to simple problems.”
Hmmm...</p>
<p>In a near-future release they’re going to do some serious deprecation, very
much in the Java style: condemned things will still work, but will complain at
the developer.</p>
<h2 id='p-8'>Web Style</h2>
<p>(The title of this section comes from
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/03/26/On-REST">here</a>.)
Rails.next will have a lot of HTTP-related machinery.  David said 
“We all know HTTP
caching is important, like flossing, and most of us leave it at that, like
flossing”.  So they’re putting in a lot of work to support output compression
and static-asset caching and so on; in particular, they’re going to put the
timestamp right there in the URI; so <code>/pix/dhh.png</code> will become
<code>/pix/dhh.png?200604121745</code>, which should allow The Right
Caching Things to happen more or less automatically.  This
makes me nervous, feels like level mixing, but needs more thought.</p>
<p>The Railsians have discovered REST, big-time; we all got a lecture on the
Four Big Verbs and the Meaning of Life, which I think was largely new to the
audience members.  David has been looking at the Atom Protocol and the
influence shows, he asserted that “POST is for creating new items... er I
mean, and updating them too”.</p>
<p>He noted that HTTP’s CRUD semantics are a pretty good match for those of
Rails.
There’s been an impedance mismatch between
Rails’ notion of a path and the Web’s notion of a resource—at the moment, a
reference to a collection and the member in a collection (different URI) are
apt to get sent to the same code.</p>
<p>They’ve got what looks like a clever workaround, which allows you to
dispatch to URIs based not only on the path but the verb you’re using.
Also, they’re going to tunnel PUT and DELETE through HTML forms using a hidden
field, all automatically.  I’m not sure how much that’ll buy you, really, but
it’s a nice idea.</p>
<p>As a finale, DHH showed the audience how you could control a browser (or
multiple browsers) from a command line, using essentially the old KnowNow trick
of keeping a socket open from the browser back to the server, so you can do
“push”.  Yawn.  Done with Flash.  Sigh.</p>

<p>I was far from the only Rails interested-but-inexperienced <i>poseur</i>,
there were a lot of people there to find out what it’s all about.  I talked to
a mostly-PHP developer from Calgary and tried to convince her that Rails ought
to be able to do most of what she does, only cleaner and better.</p>

“Rails shop” in New York, and was hip to the very latest YARV gossip.

<p><a href="http://www.daveastels.com/">Dave Astels</a>

wants to rename the whole thing to BDD for “Behavior-Driven Development”;
listening to him, it was obvious that he’s thought more about testing issues

<title>The Long Form</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I found that Orlowski’s long, incoherent
<a href="http://technology.guardian.co.uk/weekly/story/0,,1752257,00.html">anti-Wikipedia
screed</a> in the <cite>Guardian</cite> sent
my thinking in some 
unexpected directions.  Really, it’s too much to expect rational
discourse from a man whose first piece on the subject (that I saw) rejoiced in
the URL “khmer_rouge_in_daipers” <i>(sic)</i>.
Anyhow, he assembles put-downs from the usual anti-Wikipedia suspects; there’s
really not 
much new.  I will credit him for one observation that has recently become
apparent to me: the
wearing thing about being a tender of the Wikipedia flame isn’t the malicious
political or racist crazies, it’s the constant background noise of dumb
low-level minor juvenile vandalism.  After the same-old same-old bashfest is
done, the article dips into sophmore philosophy, arguing that the Net’s
endless flow of atomized information somehow prevents us from
interpreting or acquiring wisdom.  And, by the way, the kids these days are no
good, what with relying on Google instead of Real Books.
Anyhow, in among all this tilting at windmills there is a (fairly well
concealed) thing to think about, and it has to do with <em>length</em>.  It
doesn’t bother me that much 
of the prose I read these days has an age measured in hours, or is evanescent
electronic text, or is produced by principals rather than intermediaries.
But here’s what I’m coming to think: in text, short form tends to drive
out long form.
Our novelty-seeking chimpanzee minds would rather chew
through a bunch of tasty little morsels than a full balanced meal.  
For example, when I was just about to turn in last night, I glanced at the
<cite>New Yorker</cite> magazine at the end of the sofa, got started reading
George Packer’s excellent
<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060410fa_fact2">The
Lesson of Tal Afar</a>, and didn’t get to bed till way past 1AM.
And I learned some things about the state of play in Iraq that no succession
of blog posts is gonna teach me, because the material really needs a dozen
or so pages of beautifully-typeset densely-argued discourse.  I’m not going to
try to summarize Packer’s piece; but if you want to have a really educated
opinion about the way things are heading over there, you’ll read it.
As for me, I’m making a conscious effort to do more of my reading in big
chunks.  But I’m not giving up on blogs or the Wikipedia, and I remain
contemptuous of Orlowski’s posse’s ineffectual flailing at anything with that
dangerous smell of the New and Interesting.</p>

<title>Rails Asset Naming</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I said that I’d been nervous about one particular Rails innovation, rolling
timestamps into the URIs of static assets, for example
<code>/images/img23.jpg?20060412191322</code>, because it had the smell of
level-mixing about it.  So I talked to DHH about it, and he swore up and down
that when the timestamp (and hence the name) changes it’s because this
really is a new thing (Resource, in Web terms), not a changed version of the
same thing.  This leaves one question in my mind; does the system allow for
someone to link to the <code>?20060412191322</code> version after it’s been
replaced by one with a <code>?20070223101354</code> timestamp?  Because if the
old one is automagically gone after the new one arrives, I wonder if it really
is a new thing.
The reason they do this is obvious; they can set this kind of thing
cacheable-forever at the HTTP level and really cut down, first on needless
traffic, but more important, on user-perceived latency.  Which is a good
thing.</p>

<p>There’s this piece in Boston.com (an operation of the <cite>Boston

It says that “Dervala Hanley writes a quirky literary blog that
got her a job is at Stone Yamashita Partners”, but it
doesn’t link to 
<a href="http://www.dervala.net/">Dervala’s space</a> or to
<a href="http://www.stoneyamashita.com/">her employer</a>.
Then it adds “‘Decision-makers respect Google-karma,’ writes Tim Bray,
director of Web technologies for 
<a href="http://www.sun.com">Sun Microsystems</a>.”
It does link to Sun but not to <span class='o'>ongoing</span>; interestingly,
that remark about Google was from the

Eve would load but not run, looked like a video driver problem, so I went and

and by following the instructions precisely, reduced it to 640x480
pure-VGA mode.  Lauren (designated Windows hack around here)
was able to get it more or less working again but now it runs neither Eve nor
Need for Speed.  (Yes, we have the latest DirectX and all the Windows updates
and all the obvious things).  Well... could get a nice new Mac and dual-boot
it as a games box.  Or could update it to WinXP which would probably come with
the right driver-ware by default.  Of course, both of these mean buying XP.
Off the shelf, the Home upgrade is C$150, but we can’t use that
because it only upgrades from 9x and ME.  The XP Pro upgrade is C$250.
Which is totally, completely, insanely, exorbitant.
And I ain’t gonna pay.
Goodbye, Need for Speed.</p>

<title>The End of SOA</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I did an interview and a podcast 
<i>[Update:
<a href="http://blog.garbledygook.com/2006/04/17/ruby-on-rails-podcast-tim-bray-ruby-on-rails-podcast/">here</a>]</i> at
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/04/13/RoR">that Rails conference</a> and the
question came up in both, and in the hallway talk too: “What do you think we should do about
SOA?”  Which weirdly, nobody had asked me before, and I could find only one
answer: “Don’t do anything. ‘SOA’ may have meant something once but it’s just
vendor bullshit now.”  
Looking back, what happened was, certain
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html">software architects</a>
were 
uncomfortable with the framing that goes with the words “Web Services”;
maybe because people think anything with “Web” in the name should be simple and
lightweight and easy to set up.
Thus SOA, which is so much more
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprisey">Enterprisey</a>.
Me, I want to go the other way.  The crucial point is that Web-like things
<em>should</em> be simple and lightweight and easy to set up; so I think the
“Web” part of “Web Services” is more important than the “Services” part.
SOA isn’t the future,

<title>5✭♫: Take Five</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>You’ve all heard
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_Five">this</a>, it’s the biggest hit
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Brubeck">Dave Brubeck’s</a> band
ever had, only Dave didn’t write it nor does he play a solo.
The tune’s cool enough, you’ll hear it and think “Oh, I know that” but
actually you probably don’t, 
it’s an altogether astounding performance and rewards lots of close
listening.
<i>(“5✭♫” series introduction <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music">here</a>;
with <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music#p-1">an
explanation</a> of why the title may look broken.)</i></p>
<img class="inline" src="Brubeck-and-Desmond.png" alt="Paul Desmond and Dave Brubeck in 1954" />
<h2 id='p-1'>The Context</h2>
<p>Dave, born in 1920 and playing piano since 1924, is still living as I write
this and I heard a live 
concert on the radio only a couple of years ago I think; musicians, those that
don’t kill themselves with narcotics, tend to be a long-lived
bunch.</p>
<p>He fought in the war and studied classical music under
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_Milhaud">Milhaud</a> (!?!?),
formed his own band in 1951 and it became really popular right away, Dave was
the first jazzbo on the cover of <cite>Time</cite> in 1954.
Among other things, he deserves credit for hiring a black bass player and
canceling concerts and TV spots where the promoters had a problem with
that.</p>
<p>In 1959 the quartet released
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Out_%28album%29">Time Out</a>,
including <cite>Take Five</cite>, and it became one of the
biggest-selling jazz albums of all time.
The word “Time” in the title is not an accident; as a result of Dave’s
classical training and his bandmates being, apparently, a bunch of obsessive
wankers, most of the record is in weird time signatures and the songs have
lots of chord changes that are not exactly jazz-standard.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I wrote here about
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/02/20/Plutonian-Nights">Sun Ra</a>, another
keyboard player with weird ideas who succeeded partly because he had this great
sax player John Gilmore in his band.  History repeats itself; when you say
“Dave Brubeck” you really mean “Dave Brubeck and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Desmond">Paul Desmond</a>”.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Music</h2>
<p>Paul Desmond wrote this tune and provides at least half the magic, but
Brubeck gets credit for letting it happen.</p>
<p>Here’s what happens: Brubeck lays down a steady piano vamp in 5/4, a time
signature that’s typical of, well, uh, no musical tradition whatever that I
know of, then Paul Desmond plays a sax break, then
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Morello">Joe Morello</a> plays a
drum solo, then Desmond reprises, then it’s over.</p>
<p>If you follow my advice you’re going to go get <cite>Take Five</cite>,
ideally on a Brubeck CD (it’s uncompressed, it’s yours to do with as you
will), but if you really must, in filthy compressed MP3.
I’d suggest doing the following: wait till everyone else has gone to bed and 
sit in front of the speakers or plug in the headphones and play <cite>Take
Five</cite> and listen.
That tune will occupy your mind fully the first time, that’s OK, enjoy it,
then go back and listen again, carefully, mostly to the rhythms.</p>
<p>Mostly, Desmond’s solo;
why does it sound so great?  Listen to the sax and the rhythm section behind it;
hardly any of the notes are actually on the beat.  In the signature theme, the
one you recognized, every note leaps slightly ahead of the count it’s supposed
to be on, then he shifts to a few measures of right-on-the-beat for the
echoing second theme, then when he stretches out, it’s almost all
tantalizingly behind the rhythm, except for a couple of key points where he
lets it sag <em>outrageously</em> behind.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you could just relax and wonder at how compelling that
solo is; but seeing some of the machinery at work under the surface is fun
too.</p> 
<p>Want more rhythm jollies?  Listen to Morello’s drum break between
Desmond’s two outings.  He takes 5/4 and runs with
it, but listen to him gradually unhook from Dave’s foundation and build
something quite entirely different.</p>
<p>And then, the ending’s graceful.  This recording is one of the artifacts
that I’d offer in support of the proposition that <i>Homo Sapiens</i> ought to
be spared, because left to ourselves, we create beautiful things.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>West African Side-Trip</h2>
<p>I 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/06/30/Cellism">gave up</a> my cello lessons
two years ago when I joined Sun (it’s an instrument that requires obsessive
devotion) but I was unable to throw off my devotion to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euterpe">Euterpe</a> and am now
attending hand-drumming lessons from
<a href="http://www.drumming.ca/">Russell Shumsky</a>; he specializes 
in the Guinean musical tradition.
I have my own
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djembe">Djembe</a> and I’m pretty sure
that it and my cello are the most beautiful objects I own.</p>
<p>I plead guilty to really enjoying the deranged hippie new-age kozmick
sub-sub-sub-culture of the “Drum Circle” (we have
<a href="http://www.vrad.ca/">lots in Vancouver</a>) and join in whenever I
can.  And, well, I’m not a really a very good drummer.  But, for a party
trick, I can reproduce the Brubeck <cite>Take Five</cite> piano vamp
pretty exactly on my djembe, which makes some people look puzzled but gets big
smiles from others.  Just saying.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Sampling It</h2>
<p>Personally, I prefer to listen to <cite>Take Five</cite> on my old vinyl
<cite>Dave Brubeck’s Greatest Hits</cite> 33⅓ LP; it appears on a couple of
Brubeck CD compilations but all of them seem to lose something in the
transfer.  Not that they’re not totally great, and there are lots of other
wonderful Brubeck tracks, but there’s nothing like putting on that LP and
turning up the volume.</p>
<p>But you know, the musical essentials here are so great that they’ll shine
through even the musical vandalism characteristic of online music stores.
So if you really must, feel free to buy just this one track with my
blessing.</p>

<title>Important, I Think</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’m genuinely paranoid about banging my own drum and shouting “Listen to
<em>me</em>!” because I know how often I’ve been wrong about things, and how
much of the future is determined by luck and raw random chance.  That said, if
the lessons I’ve learned over the years mean anything, there’s a conversation
going on right now that’s real important.
Here are three starting points:
<a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2006/03/18/20235.aspx">Going
Down To The Crossroads</a> from Don Box, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/03/26/On-REST">Styles: Beyond WS and
REST</a> from me, and
<a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2006/04/12/21613.aspx">Spending
the $100</a> from Don.
They aren’t the whole conversation, but they reflect it well
and have pointers to most of the rest.
Right now, a <em>lot</em> of people think that Web-flavored
frameworks are the future of heterogeneous-network applications, which is to
say almost all applications; and that the WS-mountain is really a WS-molehill;
and that we need to fix up the tooling for developers.
Depending how much pull Don has, Microsoft might be first off the mark;
fair enough.  But I really think this deserves attention.
In an interesting sidelight,

Making noise about it <em>might</em> influence the government of China to
moderate its actions against Mr. Wu, and can’t do any harm.
Mr. McMynn’s kidnappers were a gaggle of small-time hoodlums, one of whom was
out on bail while awaiting trial for another kidnapping (!).
Mr. Wu’s were police.
In a civilized country, the function of the police force is to deter such
people and arrest them.  A nation where they are the same people?   Nobody

<title>XML Automaton</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>In December of 1996 I released a piece of software called
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/Lark/">Lark</a>, which was
the world’s first
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#dt-xml-proc">XML Processor</a> (as the
term is defined in the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/">XML Specification</a>).
It was successful, but I stopped maintaining it in 1998 because lots of other
smart people, and some big companies like Microsoft, were shipping perfectly
good processors.  I never <em>quite</em> open-sourced it, holding back one
clever bit in the moronic idea that I could make money out of Lark somehow.
The magic sauce is a finite state machine that can be used to parse XML 1.0.
Recently, someone out there needed one of those, so I thought I’d publish
it, with some commentary on Lark’s construction and an amusing anecdote about
the name.
I doubt there are more than twelve people on the planet who care about
this kind of parsing arcana.
<i>[Rick Jelliffe 
<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2006/04/xml_in_xml.html">has
upgraded</a> the machine].</i></p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Why “Lark”?</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren</a> and I went to
Australia in late 1996 to visit her mother and to get married, which we
did on November 30th.  Forty-eight hours later, Lauren twisted her knee
badly enough that she was pretty well
confined to a sofa for the rest of our Australian vacation.</p>
<p>So I broke out my computer and finished the work I’d already started on my
XML processor, and decided to call it Lark for <b>La</b>uren’s <b>R</b>ight
<b>K</b>nee.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>How Lark Worked</h2>
<p>Lark was a pure
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_state_machine">deterministic
finite automaton</a> (DFA)
parser, with a little teeny state stack.
Some of its transitions were labeled with named “events” that would provoke
the parser to do something if, for example, it had just recognized a start tag
or whatever.</p>
<p>DFA-driven parsers are a common enough design pattern, although I think
Lark is the only example in the XML space.
There are well-known parser generators such as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacc">yacc</a>, 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_bison">GNU bison</a>, and
<a href="https://javacc.dev.java.net/">javacc</a>,
usually used in combination with lexical scanners such as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flex_lexical_analyser">flex</a> so that
you can write your grammar in terms of tokens not characters.
Also, they handle LALR langauges, so the parsing technique is quite a bit
richer than a pure state machine.</p>
<p>I thought I had a better idea.  The grammar of XML is simple
enough, and the syntax characters few enough, that I thought I could just
write down the state machine by hand.
So that’s what I did, inventing a special-purpose DFA-description
language for the purpose.</p>
<p>Then I had a file called <code>Lark.jin</code> which was really a Java
program that used the state machine to parse XML.  The transition “events”
in the machine were mapped to <code>case</code> labels in a huge
<code>switch</code> construct.  Then there was a horrible, <em>horrible</em>
Perl program that read the <code>Lark.jin</code> and the automaton,
generated the DFA tables in Java syntax, inserted them into the code and 
produced <code>Lark.java</code>, which you actually compiled
to make the parser.</p>
<p>So while Java doesn’t have a preprocessor, Lark did, which made quite a few
things easier.</p>
<p>There were a lot of tricks; some of the state transitions 
weren’t on characters, they were on XML character classes such as
<code>NameChar</code> and so on.
This made the automaton easier to write, and in fact, to keep the class files
small, the character-class transitions persisted into the Java form, and the
real DFA was built at startup time.
These days, quick startup might be more important than <code>.class</code>
file size.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>What Was Good</h2>
<p>It was <em>damn</em> fast.  James Clark managed to hand-craft a
Java-language XML parser called
<a href="http://jclark.com/xml/xp/index.html">XP</a> that was a little faster
than Lark, but he did that by clever I/O buffering, and I was determined to
leapfrog him by improving my I/O.</p>
<p>This was before the time of standardized XML APIs, but Lark had a stream API
that influenced SAX, and a DOM-like tree API; both worked just fine.
Lark is one of very few parsers ever to have survived the
<a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/303509/2002-12-13/2002-12-19/0">billion
laughs attack</a>.</p>
<p>Lark was put into production in quite a few deployments, and the flow of
bug reports slowed to a trickle.
Then in 1998 I noticed that IBM and Microsoft and BEA and everyone else
were building XML Processors, so I decided that it wasn’t worthwhile 
maintaining mine.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>What Was Bad</h2>
<p>I never got around to teaching it namespaces, which means it wouldn’t be
real useful today.</p>
<p>It had one serious bug that would have been real work to fix and since
nobody ever encountered it in practice, I kept putting it off and never did.
If you had an internal parsed entity reference in an attribute value and the
replacement text included the attribute delimiter (<code>'</code> or
<code>"</code>), it would scream and claim you had a busted XML document.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>That Automaton</h2>
<p>What happened was,
<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/1712">Rick Jelliffe</a>, who is a
Good Person, was 
<a href="http://www.stylusstudio.com/xmldev/200604/post30110.html">looking for
a FSM for XML</a> and I eventually noticed, and so I sent him mine.</p>
<p>There’s no reason whatsoever to keep it a secret: 
<a href="/ongoing/code/lark/com/textuality/autom.txt">here it is</a>.
Be warned: it’s ugly.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there were only 227 states and 8732 transitions, so the state
number fit into a 
byte; that and the associated event index pack into a short.
To make things even tighter, the transitions were only keyed by characters up
to 127, as in 7-bit ASCII.
Characters higher than that can’t be XML syntax characters, so we’re only
interested whether they fall into classes like <code>NameChar</code> and
<code>NameStartChar</code> and so on.  A 64K <code>byte[]</code> array takes
care of that, each byte having a class bitmask.</p>
<p>As a result of all this jiggery-pokery, the DFA ends up, believe it
or not, constituting a <code>short[227][128]</code>.</p>
<p>Here’s a typical chunk of the automaton:</p>
<pre><code>1. # in Start tag GI
2. State StagGI BustedMarkup {in element type}
3. T $NameC StagGI
4. T $S InStag !EndGI
5. T > InDoc !EndGI !ReportSTag
6. T / EmptyClose !EndGI</code></pre>
<p>This state, called <code>StagGI</code>, is the state where we’re actually
reading the name of a tag, we got here by seeing a <code>&lt;</code> followed
by a <code>NameStart</code> character.<br/>
Line 1 is a comment.<br/>
In line 2 we name the state, and support error reporting, providing the name
of another state to fall back into in case of error, and in the curly braces,
some text to help build an error message.<br/>
Line 3 says that if we see a valid XML Name character, we just stay in this
state.<br/>
Line 4 says that if we see an XML space character, we move to state
<code>InStag</code> and process an <code>EndGI</code> event, which would stash
the characters in the start tag.<br/>And so on.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Other Hackery</h2>
<p>An early cut of Lark used String and StringBuffer objects to hold all the
bits and pieces of the XML.  This might be a viable strategy today, but in
1996’s Java it was painfully slow. 
So the code goes to heroic lengths to live in the land of character arrays at
all times, making Strings only when a client program asks for one through the
API.  The performance difference was mind-boggling.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>An Evil Idea</h2>
<p>If you look at the automaton, and the Lark code, at least half—I’d bet
three quarters—is there to deal with parsing the DTD and then dealing with
entity wrangling.
A whole bunch more is there to support DOM-building and walking.</p>
<p>I bet if I went through and simply removed support for anything coming out
of the <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE></code>, including all entity processing, 
then discarded
the DOM stuff, then added namespace support and SAX and StAX APIs, it would be
less than half its current size.  
Then if I reworked the I/O, knowing what I know now and stealing some tricks
that James Clark uses in
<a href="http://expat.sourceforge.net/">expat</a>, I bet it would
be the fastest Java XML parser on the planet for XML docs without a
DOCTYPE; by a wide margin.  It’s hard to beat a DFA.</p>
<p>And it would still be fully XML 1.0 compliant.  Because (snicker) this is
Java, and your basic core Java now includes an XML parser, so I could simply
instrument Larkette to buffer the prologue and if it saw a DOCTYPE with an
internal subset, defer to Java’s built-in parser.</p>
<p>I’ll probably never do it.  But the thought brings a smile to my face.</p>

<title>The Cost of AJAX</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>James Governor
<a href="http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/archives/001526.html">relays a
question</a> that sounds important
but I think is actively dangerous: do AJAX apps present more of
a server-side load?  The question is dangerous because it’s meaningless and
unanswerable.  Your typical Web page will, in the process of
loading, call back to the server for a bunch of stylesheets and graphics and
scripts and so on: for example, this <span class='o'>ongoing</span> page calls
out to three different graphics, one stylesheet, and one JavaScript file.
It also has one “AJAXy” XMLHttpRequest call.
From the server’s point of view, those are all just requests to dereference
one URI or another.  In the case
of <span class='o'>ongoing</span>, the AJAX request is for a static file less
than 200 bytes in size (i.e. cheap).
On the other hand, it could have been for something that required a
complex outer join on two ten-million-row tables (i.e. <em>very</em>
expensive).  And one of the virtues of 
the Web Architecture is that it hides those differences, the “U” in URI stands
for “Uniform”, it’s a Uniform interface to a resource on the Web that could
be, well, anything.
So saying “AJAX is expensive” (or that it’s cheap) is like saying “A mountain
bike is slower than a battle tank” (or that it’s faster).  
The truth depends on what you’re doing with it. 
In the case of web sites, it depends on how many fetches you do and
where you have to go to get the data to satisfy them.
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> is a pretty quick web site, even though it runs
on a fairly modest server, but
that has nothing to do with AJAX-or-not; it’s because of the particular way
I’ve set up the Web resources that make the pages here.
I’ve
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/02/14/AJAX-Performance">argued elsewhere</a>
that AJAX can be a performance win, system-wide; but that argument too is
contingent on context, lots of context.</p>

<title>FSS: Pink Flowers</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Friday Slide Scan #28 is two Eighties florals, one interior, one
exterior.  With a confession.</p>
<p>First some spring flowers fallen from a tree, just as now in our front
yard, at dusk.</p>
<img src="0506.jpg" alt="Fallen pink treeflowers on grass at dusk" />
<p>I’m not sure what these are, but look at the light in the center.  Rewards
enlarging.</p>
<img src="0713.jpg" alt="Flowers in shadow with light in background" />
<p>Here’s the confession.  Sometimes on Fridays when I’m feeling kinda
burned-out, I knock off work and do these slide scans in the office, because
this is where I have the
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/04/14/MineIsBigger">big
screen</a>.
Blowing these pictures up to mega-huge, picking away at the old-slide crud and
scanning artifacts, tinkering with the colour balance, and listening; I never
play music while I’m writing or coding seriously, but I play it real loud while
photo-editing.  It’s all pretty well pure pleasure; you just can’t imagine
how good that second one above looks at near-native size.
It reconstitutes the part of my mind that I earn my living with; that’s my
story and I’m sticking to it.</p>
<p>Images in the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1953
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/08/11/MomsGarden">Jean Bray</a>, Tim Bray, Cath
Bray, and
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>; when I know
exactly who took one, I’ll say; in this case, at least one is by Cath Bray.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using
a Nikon CoolScan 4000 ED scanner and cleaned up by a combination of the Nikon
scanning software and PhotoShop Elements.</p>

<title>Routing Around Spotlight</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith two hideously ugly little shell scripts for use when Spotlight
refuses to search your mail.
Spotlight is a flawed v1.0 implementation of a really good idea and will, I’m
sure, be debugged in a near-future release.
<i>[Update: The LazyWeb is educating me... these are moving targets.]</i></p>
<p>My problem is that whereas Mail.app will search my To/From/Subject
lines (slowly, and with a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/11/20/UnTiger">really irritating GUI</a>),
the “Entire Message” option just doesn’t work, it returns instantly with no
results.  Yes, I’ve read the hints about making Spotlight re-index,
but it just flatly refuses to work for me.  Mind you, I have a lot of
email, but still, it should at least try.</p>
<p>It turns out I had never really figured out the <code>-print0</code> and
<code>-0</code> idioms that a lot of the shell-command stalwarts now have.
Thanks to Malcolm Tredinnick for raising my consciousness.</p>
<p>This lives in <code>$HOME/bin</code> under the name
<code>mailgrep</code>:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
find $HOME/Library/Mail/IMAP* -name '*.emlx' -print0 | \
  xargs -0 fgrep -i $@</code></pre>
<p>Isn’t <code>xargs</code> a funny command?  I’ve discovered that it’s nearly
impossible to describe what does, and then why what it does is necessary, but
there are just a whole bunch of places where you’d be lost without it.</p>
<p>This lives in <code>$HOME/bin/mailview</code>:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
find $HOME/Library/Mail/IMAP* -name '*.emlx'  -print0 | \
  xargs -0 fgrep -i -l -Z $@ | \
  xargs -0 open</code></pre>
<p>The first cut of this dodged <code>xargs</code> and used an
incredibly-inefficient and slow chain of <code>-exec</code> arguments to open
the files one at a time with 
<code>view</code> (aka <code>vim</code>), to work around 
a well-known <code>vim</code> misfeature; it complained about the input
not being a terminal and left my Terminal.app keystrokes borked.</p>
<p>But Malcolm, confirming my belief in the broken-ness of <code>vim</code>,
said “Oh, *that* ‘view’.  I thought it was some sexy Mac ‘view my email’ app”.
D’oh, of course; the magic OS X <code>open</code> command does just the right
thing. 
Erm, you might want to run <code>mailgrep</code> before you run
<code>mailview</code>; I’m not sure what would happen if you asked OS X to
open three or four thousand email messages at once.</p>

<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/04/16/Mad-at-Microsoft">I b0rked</a> our
Win2K gamebox, I tried re-installing the OS and eventually reduced it to
complete brick-ness, it recognized neither the video adapter nor the network
card.  So Lauren brushed me aside and started wrestling with the problem, and
to make a long story short, it almost completely works again.  At one point
she seemed nearly infinite in her capabilities, sitting in front of the
computer wrangling software updates while knitting baby stuff and looking up
words in a German dictionary for the kid’s homework.  Some of the German nouns
and muttered curses at the Windows install sounded remarkably like each other.
Why would anyone not marry a geek?  The only problem is that Win2K won’t
auto-switch resolutions to play games any more, it gets the frequency wrong
and the LCD goes pear-shaped, you have to hand-select the frequency and
switch into the right resolution first.  LazyWeb?</p>

<title>Hyatt on the High-Res Web</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Check out Dave Hyatt’s
<a href="http://webkit.opendarwin.org/blog/?p=55">excellent write-up</a> on
designing and rendering Web pages so they take advantage of the
higher-resolution screens that <em>may</em> be coming our way. 
I emphasize “may” because I’ve seen how slowly we’ve picked up pixels over
the years. The first really substantial screen I ever worked on was a
1988-vintage Sun workstation with about a million pixels.  The Mac on my
lap right now, which has 125 times as much memory as that workstation, has
only 1.38 million pixels.
Anyhow, Hyatt has some smart things to say on the issues,
which are trickier than you might think.  I suspect that sometime in a couple of
years, if I still care about <span class='o'>ongoing</span>, I’m  going to
have to go back and reprocess all the images so that higher-res versions are
available for those who have the screens and don’t mind downloading bigger
files. 
Anyhow, Dave’s piece may be slightly misleading in that he talks about SVG
as though 
it’s something coming in the future.  Not so, check out
<a href="http://zcorpan.1go.dk/sandbox/svg/atom/.xml">this nifty SVG Atom
logo</a>, which works fine in all the Mozilla browsers I have here.
Load it up, resize the window, and watch what happens.  Then do a “view
source”.
<i>[Update:

Opera 9 does SVG (and Opera 8 “SVG Tiny”) too.]

<title>Just A Kid</title>

<body>
<p>Last weekend, Lauren felt like cooking up home-made Easter eggs, so
the shopping list included “chocolate chips (large bag)”.  I was heading down
the bulk-foods aisle and realized one of the vertical acrylic bins was full of
them.  Someone had been sloppy, and there was a little heap of chocolate chips
on the shelf underneath it.  For a second, I flashed into pure eight-year-old
mode, thinking “Holy cow, there’s a <em>whole bin</em> full of chocolate
chips, and more just lying there!”  I popped a few in my mouth and they were
excellent; semi-sweet, dark, strong, and firm.  I was still in the state that
Buddhists don’t mean when they say “Child’s Mind”, thinking “I
can get as many as I want!”  The list did say “large bag” after all, so I put
a bag under the spout and gleefully jammed the lever <em>all the way
over</em>.  At home, Lauren said “You went overboard, a bit, didn’t you?”
and now we have a plastic canister-full in the pantry which should last us
into 2007.  It’s a good feeling.</p>

<title>Atomic Monday</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>First of all, implementors of anything Atom-related need to spend some time
<a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000793.html">chez
Jacques Distler</a>; in particular, the conversation that plays out in the
comments. Second, there’s this piece of software called
<a href="http://www.planetplanet.org/">Planet Planet</a> that allows you to
make an aggregate web page by reading lots of feeds; for example, see
<a href="http://www.planetapache.org/">Planet Apache</a> or
<a href="http://planetsun.org/">Planet Sun</a>.
Sam Ruby decided that its Atom support needed some work, so
<a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/04/23/Adding-Atom-support-to-PlanetPlanet">he did
it</a>.  Now, here’s the exciting part: he pinged me over the weekend and said
“Hey, look at this” wanting to show me his cleverly-Atomized
Planet Intertwingly feed. 
I looked at it in
<a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a> and was puzzled for
a moment; some but not all of the 
things in the feed were highlighted as unread, even though this was the first
time I’d seen it.  Then the light went on. 
This
is Atom doing <em>exactly what we went to all that trouble to make it do</em>.
NetNewsWire has good Atom support and, because Atom entries all have unique
IDs and timestamps,  it can
tell that it’s seen lots of those entries before in other feeds that I
subscribe to.  That’s how I found Jacques’ piece.  This is huge; anyone who
uses synthetic or aggregated feeds knows that dupes are a big problem, showing
up all over the place.
No longer, Atom makes that problem go away.</p>

<title>5✭♫: One More Cup of Coffee</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’m not really a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan">Bob Dylan</a> fan.  A voice
like that, and a tunesmithing talent like that, come along only a few times
per century, but he’s still kind of irritating.
That aside, the song <cite>One More Cup of Coffee</cite>, from the 1976 album
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_%28album%29">Desire</a>, can’t be
ignored; wonderful tune, wonderful orchestration, wonderful performance.
<i>(“5✭♫” series introduction <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music">here</a>;
with <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music#p-1">an
explanation</a> of why the title may look broken.)</i></p>
<img src="Desire.png" class="inline" alt="Desire, by Bob Dylan" />
<h2 id='p-1'>The Context</h2>
<p>Nothing I can possibly write will add any wisdom to the
millions of words, some 90% of them in excess of needs, written on the subject
of this particular person.</p>
<p>A personal statement: Bob Dylan has long irritated me for, during the first
thirty years or 
so of his career, never having given a straight answer to a straight question,
and for writing songs with dozens of boring verses.  But they’ll still be
listening 
to lots of his performances long after I’m dead, and in recent years he’s
become a better, more direct, interview.</p>
<p>My taste in Dylan is a little unusual: once you get past <cite>One More Cup
of Coffee</cite>, my favorites would be <cite>Baby Let Me Follow You
Down</cite> (from the <cite>Last Waltz</cite> soundtrack) and 
<cite>Crash on the Levee (Down in the Flood)</cite> from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Basement_Tapes">The Basement
Tapes</a>.</p>
<p><cite>Desire</cite>, the record, is hit and miss. <cite>Joey</cite>,
glorification of the life of some mafioso, is flawed in concept
and unlistenable in execution.  <cite>Hurricane</cite>, whatever you think
about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubin_Carter">Mr. Carter</a>, that song
rocks; and <cite>Isis</cite> hits pretty hard too.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Music</h2>
<p>Is there anything in <cite>One More Cup of Coffee</cite> that’s not
perfect?  Well yes, in the verses, the
lyrics on occasion drag (“He oversees his kingdom / So no stranger does
intrude / His voice it trembles as he calls out / For another plate of food”).
But apart from that, the sentiment is compelling,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlet_Rivera">Scarlet Rivera’s</a>
violin is beautifully scored and played, the tune is to die for, and the
backing vocals are by Emmylou Harris, who you can bet is going to be here in
the 5-✭ series one of these days.
And while there’s not much middle ground on the subject of Dylan’s singing, if
you like it, you’ll <em>really</em> like this song.</p>
<p>Listen to the choruses: Bob and Emmylou veer wildly around the rhythm, then
coalesce on the beat when it matters, and they’re making it
up as they go along, they’re wholly inhabiting the moment, and it’s
quite, quite perfect.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Sampling It</h2>
<p>Oh yeah, it’s out there.  And there’s a live version too; but the smart
thing  would be to go buy the un-compressed un-DRM’ed shiny round silver
version of <cite>Desire</cite>; it’s a keeper.</p>

<p>I got email late yesterday from
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/bio.php#berlind">David Berlind</a>: “Hey, can
I call you for a minute?”  He wanted commentary on
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=2906">a story he was writing</a> that I
think is about the potential for intellectual-property lock-ins on RSS and Atom
extensions.  I say “I think is about” because the headline is “Will or could
RSS get forked?”.  After a few minutes’ chat, David asked if he could record
for a podcast, and even though I only had a cellphone, the audio came out OK.
The conversation was rhythmic: David brought up a succession of potential
issues and answered each along the lines of “Yes, it’s reasonable to worry
about that, but in this 
case I don’t see any particular problems.”  
Plus I emitted a mercifully-brief rant on the difference between protocols,
data, and software.
On the one hand, I thought David could have been a 
little clearer that I was pushing back against the thrust of his story, but on
the other hand he included the whole conversation right
there in the piece, so anyone who actually cares can listen and find out what
I actually said, not what I think I said nor what David reported I said.
I find this raw barely-intermediated journalism (we
talk on the phone this afternoon, it’s on the Web in hours) a little
shocking still.
On balance, it’s better than the way we used to do things.</p>

<p>Been too busy, hardly watched any regular-season games, so all the teams
are more or less new to me.  I’m really enjoying the TNT coverage of the
Lakers and Suns; can’t see the Lakers getting out of this series even though
they’re (just) holding on to a Game 2 lead.  Of the teams I’ve seen, my money
would be on the Suns.  Anyhow, TNT is being fairly free with their camera
angles, using the floor-level shot to particularly good effect.  And—goodness
gracious me—is that a <em>Phil Glass</em> soundtrack on the Tylenol ad?!?
The mind boggles.  What next... John Cage for Nyquil?  Cecil Taylor for

<title>Scott</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’ve been watching our internal leadership conference and spending quite a
bit of time talking in the virtual hallways, and I’ve been surprised at
the intensity of feeling about Mr. McNealy.  Yes, there are those
here saying “About bloody time, now we can make some progress” but there’s a
much bigger group that is genuinely emotional about this transition.
Maybe it’s a function of seniority: I never met nor corresponded with Scott, and
he hasn’t been
much of a presence in the company’s conversation in the time I’ve been here.
But there are a lot of smart, seasoned, unsentimental people making it clear
that 
he’s been a major force in their lives, at a more personal level than I’m
used to hearing when people speak about executives.  I guess also that to a
lot of people, Sun’s vision, for which Scott gets some of the credit, was a
radical and wonderful thing.   I first used Unix in 1979 and quit a nice
big-company job
to become a VAX-bsd sysadmin in 1983, so I’ve always kind of
lived inside that vision.
But I’ll tell you one thing, what I’ve been hearing the last couple of days
makes me really regret that I didn’t get to know Scott.</p>

<p>Most people would generally prefer a climate where it’s bright
and warm most of the time. But for Canadians and others who live where it’s
not, there are compensations, and one is the experience of
spring.  I have a picture.</p>
<img src="IMGP3247.jpg" alt="Pear blossoms against cherry blossoms" />
<div class="caption"><p>The blossoms are pear in the foreground, cherry behind.</p></div>
<p>After all the months of 50° North Latitude winter—icy-sharp in most
of Canada, wet and dark here in Vancouver—the soul, the spirit, and the
libido all spring to life when the sun comes back.  We’ve had a solid year of
crappy weather, but this last Saturday through Monday were solidly summery,
bright 
and warm; and in this season the days are already long and each gets
longer so fast you can feel it.</p>
<p>On the back porch, our pear tree’s branches were silhouetted against the
neighbors’ big wild old cherry; the cherry yields no edible fruit but who
cares, it’s beautiful
tree any time of year.</p>

<title>Flat Files Rule</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Yes, databases are useful.  But there are a lot of good reasons
<em>not</em> to use them: they’re a lot of work to administer and it’s very
easy to make them run slow.  Particularly when the alternative, ordinary flat
files in an ordinary directory tree, is so incredibly useful.  For more
evidence, see 
<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/04/database_war_stories_2_bloglin.html">Tim
O’Reilly’s reportage</a> on the subject, with inputs from Mark Fletcher
(Bloglines) and Gabe Rivera (Memeorandum).  Note that both of them are
supplementing their flat files with memory-resident data stores; it’s a
powerful combination.  Now if Mark would only put some of that powerful
machinery to fixing Bloglines’

gripe saying there were problems with my Atom feed in
<a href="http://www.blogbridge.com/">BlogBridge</a>, so I downloaded it and
it’s still very good and not slow any more.  Except for, when I first
downloaded it, it wouldn’t work at all; muttered quietly on startup about my
previous “Guides” being corrupted, but then sat there sullenly and refused to
do much of anything.  Not entirely unreasonable, I figured if I wiped out the
settings from the previous install I should be fine; but it took me the
longest time to figure out they were in <code>$HOME/.bb</code> as opposed to
somewhere under <code>$HOME/Library</code>; harrumph.  Anyhow, yes, it’s slick
and fast and fun to use and imports OPML just fine and (as it’s Java) runs
everywhere; so it’s now replaced
Bloglines as my recommended feed-reader for anyone who’s not on a Macintosh
and thus can’t use  <a

And, oh, yes, it’s got a relative-URI bug in its Atom 1.0 handling,
a subtle one which
most people won’t notice.
I filed a bug report, let’s see what happens.

<title>Having Done Java</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Here’s an observation: if there’s something you as a programmer want to do
(connect to a website, read some XML, walk a filesystem, listen on a socket,
whatever)
there’ll be a library in whatever language you’re using to do that.
I’ve observed that,
on average, the quality of the libraries is better in Java than in the
competition: Perl, Python, Ruby, whatever.  Don’t get upset, those other
languages have lots of other advantages and are The Right Tool for lots of
jobs.  And the delta isn’t universal—there are stinky Java libraries and
lovely Ruby ones—but still, I’d say this is true way, way more often than
not. 
This suggests a hypothesis: Having been a Java programmer will make you a
better Ruby or Python or whatever programmer.  Ooh, are people ever gonna get
mad at me.</p>

<title>SAML On The March</title>

<body>
<p>I tell people I’m a software generalist, but there are lots of holes in my
knowledge.  One of them is identity and I really must fix that, because it’s
a hot pain point both for businesses and individual people. (How many passwords
do <em>you</em> have?)
Anyhow, our own
<a href="http://www.xmlgrrl.com/blog/">Eve Maler</a> is one of the people you
want to watch in this space, and she’s pointing us at a bunch of action over
in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML">SAML</a>-land,

and
<a href="http://www.xmlgrrl.com/blog/archives/2006/04/28/more-about-the-danish-government-saml-situation/">here</a>.
For my money, the hot story is the
<a href="http://europa.eu.int/idabc/en/document/5538/194">Danish
requirement</a> that if you want to do federation, you should
bloody well use SAML.  The
Danes have had

experiences</a> with shared standardized XML vocabularies, having scored a big
win with UBL.
I can’t imagine anything in the short term that would be of greater benefit
for everyone than ubiquitous shareable identity services.</p>

morning it seemed like 
every other Canadian had that U.S. urge so I sat for 90 minutes in a line
of cars at the border.  Anyhow, the event was terrific.  Simon Phipps has
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/webmink?entry=monopolists_annexing_the_revolution">written
eloquently</a> of marketing values leeching the life out of some Linux events;
but not this one.</p>
<p>Because I was late, I only got to see a couple of minutes of our own

attended a <em>terrific</em> talk by
<a href="http://martinconsulting.com/">Brian Martin</a> about making your

exit codes and useful diagnostics; but presented with clarity and verve and
terrific examples; the kind of thing we should all bear in mind more than we
do.</p>

no marketing values here.</p>
<p>This is why Linux blew past the BSDs and nearly became the only Unix-like

they like each other and like computers.  Is this so hard to understand?</p>

<title>The Rails Lesson</title>

<p>Over at Geertjan’s blog, 
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/geertjan?entry=the_best_feature_of_the">The Best Feature Of The Upcoming NetBeans IDE 5.5</a>
is the strongest evidence I’ve seen that the mainstream Java universe is
really paying attention to that lesson.  Sure, over at the excellent
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/theaquarium">Aquarium</a>, you can
read about how they’re slaving away in the engine room trying to make Java
EE.next simpler and simpler and yet simpler.  But I haven’t been convinced
that they’ve got to a place yet where they’re going to win lots of converts
from PHP and Rails.  But this GlassFish+IDE combo is really coming 
along: in Geertjan’s example, he makes what looks like a basic CRUD app with
no coding and no file editing.  In particular, it looks like they’re getting
close to Rails levels of DRY (“Don’t Repeat Yourself”).
Geertjan skips lightly over the database-selection wizard; I wonder how much
more than “use these tables” it needs?  
<i>[Update: He 
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/geertjan?entry=the_best_feature_of_the1">follows
up</a> with the details.]</i>
And the Rails people will be
asking “What is this ‘Deploy’ of which you speak?”  But still, we’re in
interesting territory.
<i>[Update: Not ten minutes after writing this, I ran across
<a href="http://blog.sockdrawer.org/?p=28">Java web frameworks - the Rails influence</a>,

<title>Dumbarton</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is the name of the southernmost bridge across San Francisco Bay.  At
the west end is our Menlo Park campus, where I usually work while I’m here,
and at the east end is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newark,_California">Newark</a>, a
salt-mining town, where I usually
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/11/23/TheFuture">stay</a>.  So I’ve driven
across that bridge a lot, usually in a hurry, often noting that there’s a
walking trail at one end and a
<a href="http://www.fws.gov/desfbay/">wildlife refuge</a> at the other.
Yesterday I stopped at both.  Herewith the pictures, with remarks on tequila
and hell.</p> 
<h2 id='p-1'>The Bridge and Hell</h2>
<p>The bridge runs flat across the water but has an elevated stretch in
the middle to let boats under.  Here’s that arch, first looking east from right
underneath it, then back from way across at the other end.</p>
<img src="IMG_4730.jpg" alt="Dumbarton bridge arch, looking east" />
<img src="IMG_4742.jpg" alt="Dumbarton bridge arch from the East Bay" />
<p>One time many years ago I was driving across with my old friend Lee Levin
and the fog had set in; we could only see a short stretch of the road ahead
and behind us.  Apropos of nothing, Lee said “This is like Hell.”  I was
puzzled and he explained: “No choices.”</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Flats</h2>
<p>Walking around the hiking trails by the water, you can practically
see the bay silting up around the edges, making a good place for things to
live, and then the sea chipping away at it; you wouldn’t expect it to look the
same from one year to the next.</p>
<img src="IMG_4729.jpg" alt="Water grass near the Dumbarton Bridge in San Francisco Bay" />
<p>I took a photo of my shadow in the grass, and shooting right through the
eye of the sun like this, you get all sorts of optical effects.</p>
<img src="IMG_4719.jpg" alt="Photographer’s shadow, from San Francisco Bay walking trail near the Dumbarton Bridge" />
<p>I was the only one in that little piece of park at the west end, and it
felt a little weird, with the slanting sun, arching bridge, and howling traffic.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Tequila</h2>

Wildlife Refuge</a> is a nice place for a walk at the end of the day,
there’s a little circular trail maybe a couple of miles long that leaves the
waterline and climbs a little hill for the vegetation and the view.</p>

<p>When I was growing up in Lebanon we called these “Century Plants”, great
big succulents that, every few years, shoot up a huge, dramatic miniature
tree.</p> 
<img src="IMG_4740.jpg" alt="Agaves in the Don Edwards Wildlife Reserve, San Francisco Bay near Dumbarton Bridge" />
<p>The Wikipedia says a Century Plant is an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_Plant">agave</a>; in Mexico they
cut the stem before it flowers and gather <i>agua miel</i>, whence
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mezcal">Mezcal</a> and of course
Tequila.</p>
<p>But it also says that they die after flowering, but in Lebanon they didn’t
so probably it was a different plant.
Say goodnight to the agaves, and next time you drive across that bridge, give
some thought to getting out and walking.</p>

<body>
<p>My thinking about computers changed this week.
I’ve been watching the general trends in Web traffic and data sizes and so on,
and been kind of worried that the servers aren’t going to be up to the loads
that we’ll be throwing at them.  
Well... now I’m not worried about that any more.
But we have some
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/Concurrency/">serious software pain</a>
coming at us.</p>

<title>FSS: Avebury</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Friday Slide Scan #30 is from a 1988 visit to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avebury">Avebury</a>, a place in England
with standing stones, not too far from Stonehenge and a much nicer place to
visit.</p>
<img src="1071.jpg" alt="Standing stone at Avebury" />
<img src="1068.jpg" alt="Standing stone at Avebury" />
<p>Stonehenge has just had too many tourists for too many years; it’s
fenced-off, crowded, bus-infested.  Avebury is relatively untroubled, you’re
free to wander around the stones, lean up against them, whatever.  The little
town of Avebury, more or less in the center of the stones, is well-supplied
with New Age nonsense and perfectly decent pubs and tea-rooms.  Many many
years ago I once stayed in a B&amp;B in the town and drank oceans of beer with
the friendly locals at the local.</p>
<p>There is approximately zero historical evidence about who erected
the stones or why they did it.  Which doesn’t matter; they make an impression
still, and there’s understanding in just touching one.  If you had the
opportunity to help build such a thing, how could you not?</p>
<p>Images in the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1953
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>, 
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/08/11/MomsGarden">Jean Bray</a>, Tim Bray, Cath
Bray, and
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>; when I know
exactly who took one, I’ll say; in this case, me.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using
a Nikon CoolScan 4000 ED scanner and cleaned up by a combination of the Nikon
scanning software and PhotoShop Elements.</p>

<body>
<p>This last week, I spent a bunch of time in a room with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Bechtolsheim">Andy
Bechtolsheim</a>.  He brought along some of the new boxes he’s working on;
some almost ready, some raw sheet-metal prototypes. I got
some cool pix of a Thumper’s guts but they won’t let me run ’em.
Anyhow, when you listen to Andy talk about these boxes,
you realize that in their own way they’re beautiful.
You have to watch it around him; if you
ask a simple question like why one server’s I/O is surprisingly faster than
another’s, you’re apt to get a 45-minute dissertation involving ten or fifteen
pages’ worth of block diagrams (no, I’m not exaggerating).
Anyhow, while they say
<a href="http://www.sun.com/x64/">the X64 boxes</a> are our
fastest-growing product
line, I think that group’s feeling a little starved for love in among all the
T2000 hoop-la.  The marketing group sends me notes from time to time
pointing to their news (for example a
<a href="http://www.sun.com/servers/entry/x4100/calc/">power calculator</a>
and a 
<a href="http://blog.tallsails.com/2006/04/18/virtualization-is-the-coolest-thing.aspx">virtualization
maniac</a>), wondering if it’s bloggable.  I keep telling them to grow their
own bloggers, but they haven’t yet.  Which is a pity, because what Andy’s
doing makes a pretty compelling story.</p>

<title>You Too Can Shoot High-Def</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>What happened was, we’ve had an
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/05/KrashTV">HDTV</a> for a while now, and
the decent old Canon camcorder
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/08/14/Video">wasn’t cutting it</a>, and we’ve
got a
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/archives/2006/03/09/conditions/">terrific
video opportunity</a> coming up.  So I ended up buying a Sony HDR-HC1, which
records 1080i High-Def.  This was a non-obvious choice for a couple of
reasons, and it turns out that home-HDTV is still a pretty bleeding-edge
technology. Herewith the narrative, with some pictures but 
<em>no</em> video samples.</p>
<img src="HDR-HC1.png" alt="Sony HDR-HC1" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Buying The Camera</h2>
<p>Right at the moment, there seem to be three choices for consumer-grade
HDTV.  This camera, just under a year old, was the first-ever; since then
there’s been the 
<a href="http://www.camcorderinfo.com/content/Sanyo-Announces-$800-First-High-Definition-SD-Recording-Camcorder.htm">Sanyo
VPC-HD1</a> and an upgrade from Sony, the HDR-HC3.</p>
<p>The Sanyo looks very attractive; it’s smaller and cheaper than the Sony,
and records on a flash card, thus no moving parts.
But I poked around the reviews and forums and the message was very mixed; in
particular, the low-light performance is apparently just not there.</p>
<p>I’m still mad at Sony over their egregious
rootkit abuse last year, and Lauren’s even madder, but there didn’t seem to be
any other good options if we wanted to have archival-quality footage of the
impending Bundle of Joy.</p>
<p>Poking around the options revealed that a lot of people thought the HC3
wasn’t necessarily a step forward.  For example, I was horrified to discover
that they’d subtracted the microphone-in jack.  As a certifiable audio weenie
and owner of a decent (Sony, as it turns out) external microphone, this was
completely out of the question.</p>
<p>So the next time I was in an electronics emporium, I asked about the Sonys
and they had exactly one HC1 left in stock, heavily discounted because the HC3
was coming in.  Impulse buy time.</p>
<img src="HDR-HC1-2.png" alt="Sony HDR-HC1" />
<div class="caption"><p>Credit, both camera photos:
<a href="http://www.sonyhdvinfo.com/article.php?filename=Photos-of-the-HDR-HC1">Sony
HDV Info</a>.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Big Picture</h2>
<p>There are definitely things to like:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It takes great videos, even in low light; they look wonderful on our HD
screen (more below).</p></li>
<li><p>It’s really easy to use (more below).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Well, you might ask, with these things in the “Pro” column, isn’t the
argument over?  And, to be fair, design goal #1 has been achieved; we can
shoot film that looks terrific on the big screen.
But there are multiple flies in the ointment.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It’s kind of ugly.</p></li>
<li><p>The camera has a stupid nonstandard “Active Interface Shoe”, so I can’t
mount my perfectly-standard Sony microphone on it.
Poking around suggests that you can get a doohickey so that you can screw a
standard shoe into the tripod mount socket on the <em>bottom</em> of the
camera; an example, I think, is this
<a href="http://www.zotzdigital.com/item.php?pid=279&amp;cid=187">Audio
Technica product</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>As of yet, there’s no good way to blast HD video onto a disk for playback,
so you have to use the camera as a source.  That’s OK, it even has a dinky
little remote.  Presumably, time and either Blu-Ray or HD-DVD will solve this
problem.
In the interim, I’m going to be nervous about playing the movies too much,
tape inevitably wears out.</p></li>
<li><p>I haven’t managed to produce decent video output for display on a computer
screen (more below).</p></li>
<li><p>The manual is irritating; there’s no reference section.
It’s 100% task-oriented, which is nice, but if you want to find out what a
button or dial does, you have to go read through the narrative of some goal
or another and spot your control’s function.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s a pity it saves to tape rather than disk or, even better, some
form of silicon.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s drill down a bit on the upsides and downsides.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Looks Good!</h2>
<p>Here are three stills from the thirty-second test movie I shot on my first
day with the camera, no practice; they are screen grabs from iMovie HD.  
I think they speak for themselves.</p>
<img src="Outdoor-Cat.png" alt="Cat on lawn; screen grab from Sony HDR-HC1 output" />
<img src="Tulips.png" alt="Violet tulips; screen grab from Sony HDR-HC1 output" />
<img src="Indoor-Cat.png" alt="Cat on lawn; screen grab from Sony HDR-HC1 output" />
<p>On the first one, you can see the hairs on the cat and the individual
blades of grass shaking in the wind.  The second is there for colour variety,
and the third is inside after dark, by ordinary incandescent light.
Trust me, your kids and pets are going to look outstanding on your
widescreen.</p>
<h2 id='p-8'>Stills Too</h2>
<p>This thing shoots stills too at 1920x1440, on a filthy Sony “Memory Stick”
of course, but who cares, it’s got a USB.  Here’s one, entirely unedited.</p>
<img src="DSC00132.jpg" alt="Yellow poppy shot with Sony HDR-HC1 (still mode)" />
<p>All videocams have
pretty impressive built-in telephotos, and Doc Searls has used this to good
effect to do some terrific semi-stealth portraiture.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Easy</h2>
<p>I’ve only ever used one videocam before, that 2000-vintage Canon,
so I’m no expert.
The Sony’s shooting ergonomics are maybe a little
weird (you pull the mode lever <em>down</em> to turn it on, and it’s easy for
your shooting finger to confuse that lever and the stop/go button); but I 
found them easy to pick up, and got
some good video of the kid’s ball game without much pain.
The zoom control is excellent, silky-smooth and very precise.</p>
<p>I probably would have been a little happier with more buttons on the
outside to avoid using the LCD menus. On the other hand, the
menu navigation is all touch-screen and really very slick, no more fiddling
with up and down and back and confirm buttons.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>iMovie HD</h2>
<p>iMovie isn’t brilliant software, but it’s OK.  On one of my little-league
shots, I was standing right by first base and got this great shot of a kid
running out a hit, rounding the base, and high-tailing it for second.  Looked
good on camera playback, but iMovie suffered some serious digital breakdown
during the part when the whole screen was filled with the girl in her bright
red shirt flashing by.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I didn’t have too much trouble pulling together a movie and
blasting it back onto the DV tape so I could hook the camera to the TV to show
it.  Which is klunky, obviously, but will do for now.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>The Output Problem</h2>
<p>When I was writing this, I figured I should include a movie, so I told
iMovie to export (which is under “File/Share”, Human Interface Guidelines be
damned), and selected “CD” quality.  Except for, it butchered the movie from
16:9 into 4:3 form-factor and it looked horrible.  
The Apple support forums have
<a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303177">a
workaround</a>; that procedure saved the 30 seconds into a 401-Megabyte file
which my 1.67GHz PowerPC PowerBook couldn’t play at all smoothly.  I spent
some time fiddling with the options, told it to use the MPEG-4 encoding again
and reduce it to 
800x450; at “Medium” compression that produced a 26M QuickTime that looks
crappy compared to what I’d been seeing in iMovie.  So I tried “High Quality”
compression; the file was 80MB and looked better, only the PowerBook couldn’t
display it smoothly.</p>
<p>Some obvious conclusions suggest themselves.  Maybe iMovie isn’t the right
program for making Web-friendly video.  Maybe a PowerBook just isn’t a
video-wrangling platform.
Maybe the idea of using
HD-format video on the Web is silly.  Maybe I’m clueless about this
stuff. <i>[Do ya <b>think</b>?! -Ed.]</i></p>
<p>But starting now, there will be archival-quality digital footage of the
family.  Of course, then we’ll be in the backup swamp

<title>Making Web Video</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Yesterday I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/05/08/Video">reported</a> on shooting
high-def video with the new Sony HDR-HC1, and the trials and tribulations of
trying to generate computer-display output.  When last I wrote, my
PowerBook couldn’t manage to play the 800x450 MPEG-4 encoded QuickTimes unless
they were encoded at “Medium” quality.  Well, I’ve also got this 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/10/18/New-Computer">Ultra 20</a> with a
2.66GHz Opteron and an NVIDIA Quadro FX 1400 (!) so I fired up the 
<a href="http://www.nexenta.com/">Nexenta</a> α4 package manager and picked up
<a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/">mplayer</a>.  <i>Bug: Mplayer wouldn’t play
the <code>.mov</code> files from the GUI; must report.</i>  Anyhow,
that combo eats those QuickTimes for breakfast, I even made a High-quality
435M 1920x1080 version and they all ran without a hitch or a glitch.  The fan
fired up, so I guess things were working kind of hard. 
But still, something’s not quite right. When the picture’s moving I can see
scan lines and pixelation, but I want that creamy smoothness that iMovie
manages, and that I see in 
online movie trailers.  So... Dear LazyWeb:  Can iMovie be made to morph
high-def DV files into something really good-looking?  For encoders, it
offers: Apple encoders including H.263, a bunch of DVCPRO variants,
H.261/263/264, Motion JPEG A and B, and Sorenson Video.  Or maybe I need to
junk iMovie and get something else?

<title>Getting From HD to the Screen</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>As of mid-2006, iMovie HD doesn’t export HD video to QuickTime in a usable
form; it comes out in 4:3 rather than 16:9, the display is marred by scan
lines, and even at a modest width (say 800) reasonably-powerful computers
can’t render it smoothly.  Here’s the recipe for fixing the problem.
<i>[Update: Forgot the acknowledgments!  Thanks for good advice to
<a href="http://geekable.com/blog/">Jeffrey Czerniak</a>,
<a href="http://www.hdforindies.com/">Mike Curtis</a>,
<a href="http://kontrawize.blogs.com/">Tony Coates</a>, and 
Charles Witgen.]</i>
<i>[Update: Mike Curtis has suggested a substantial improvement, and it
works.]</i></p>
<p>iMovie’s export function is under “File/Share”.  You have to pick 
“Expert Settings”.</p>
<img src="V1.png" alt="Exporting from iMovie HD to QuickTime" />
<p>Then you need to click the “Options” button.</p>
<img src="V2.png" alt="Exporting from iMovie HD to QuickTime" />
<p>This screen summarizes the export settings.  The idea is you export at the
native 1920x1080, no compression whatsoever.</p>
<img src="V3.png" alt="Exporting from iMovie HD to QuickTime" />
<p>The only sub-menu with any complexity is “Settings”.</p>
<img src="V4.png" alt="Exporting from iMovie HD to QuickTime" />
<p>The output file is huge, 10G a minute or so; and it takes an irritatingly
long time to write, eight or ten minutes elapsed
for each minute of 
video on my 1.67GHz PowerPC PowerBook.</p>
<p>The problem we’re trying to solve is that in 1080i HD, the “i” stands for
interlaced, which 
is something that you just don’t want to try to do on a computer screen.
If you want to de-interlace, you can go buy Apple’s Final Cut Studio for
$1299, or you can go and get
<a href="http://home.planet.nl/~jeschot/#DEI">JES Deinterlacer</a>, which is
free and does the job.</p>
<p>Deinterlacer’s a Carbon app, which looks a little low-rent these days;
appropriate since it’s free.  It’s pretty self-explanatory, except for the
Output tab.  You can’t use the Direct output function, you have to pick the
“QuickTime Movie” option off the “Export” menu.</p>
<img src="V5.png" alt="Exporting from iMovie HD to QuickTime" />
<p>That gets you this screen, which might you remind you of something we’ve
already seen; in fact, it’s more or less the same QuickTime export dialogue
that iMovie uses.</p>
<p>So, pick your size (remember that 16:9 ratio) and turn the process loose.</p>
<img src="V6.png" alt="Exporting from iMovie HD to QuickTime" />
<p>The compress-and de-interlace process is slow, maybe 4 frames per second.</p>
<p>The output from this process seems unreasonably large, about a megabyte per 
second, but the quality is <em>way</em> better than you usually see in Web
video.  I’m investigating size/quality trade-offs.</p>
<p>The file you get runs fine on my PowerBook with QuickTime and VLC, under
mplayer (but not Xine, hmm) on my x64 GNU/Solaris box, and on a modern XP and
an old Win2K box, which is a pretty good sample.</p>

<title>iCal Sucks Hugely</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’ve been using iCal for a couple of years now; never really loved it but
it’s OK.  Today for
some reason my PowerBook locked up (no big gripe, this hardly ever happens)
and when it came back up, iCal showed a little red splodge next to my
calendar which when clicked said “iCal was unable to load the calendar.  The
file might be corrupted or temporarly <i>(sic)</i> unreadable.  you can try
again later or reset this calendar.  Resetting the calendar will remove all
calendar content.”
<em>There are not words to express how much this sucks.</em> 
A programmer working for
me who left this kind of hole in a personal-productivity application would be
subject to dismissal.
Anyhow, I got my life back; read on to find out how, along with some other
advice to iCal users and to Apple.</p>
<img src="iCal-Sucks.png" alt="iCal Losing my Calendar" />
<h2 id='p-1'>What Went Wrong</h2>
<p>Of course, in a sane world iCal would store a calendar named “Tim” in
<code>Library/Calendars/Tim</code>, but they’re off in <code>Library/Application&#xa0;Support/iCal/Sources/&lt;long-hexadecimal-string></code>.
And mine contained eight hundred thousand null bytes.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Dear Apple</h2>
<p>Here’s how you update a file containing valuable data safely:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>First, you write out the new version without touching the old version,
and carefully check that it worked.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, you move the old version aside, giving it name like
Tim.ics.backup, and carefully check that the move worked.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, you move the new version in to the location of the old version
and carefully check that this worked.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, you delete the backup.  Even better, don’t; keep a few generations
around.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I don’t want to be rude.  But a personal-productivity application that
updates crucial high-value information files in place is Broken As
Designed, and evidence of an extreme lack of professionalism.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Dear World</h2>
<p>Try to find an alternative to iCal.  While its UI is good, it’s still kind
of sluggish.  
And all the exciting action out there is in shared calendaring on the net, so
you can update it from anywhere and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/05/Calendar-Funnies">share it</a> with
family and friends.  
Anyhow, my hunt for alternatives is now officially in high gear.  I would like
an Open-Source alternative so I can verify that they, unlike the iCal
developers, know how to save files safely.</p>
<p>But if you must use iCal, publish your calendar.  That means, find or build
a WebDAV server somewhere, or use Apple’s own .Mac service, so that when iCal
decides that it’s OK to discard your whole life, there’ll be an alternative
somewhere else.</p>
<p>That’s what I did, so I was able to go get the <code>.ics</code> file back
from that server and restore my life.
It could have been worse; it could have decided to upload the corrupted
calendar and overwrite the backup.</p>

to <em>just fixing their stupidly broken Atom 1.0 handling</em>.  “Odd” is one

Countermeasures are appropriate and if I have to I’ll take them, but wouldn’t

quality time with Open Office, in particular the

alpha of their version of OO.o 2 up, and it’s a <em>vast</em> improvement over
1.2, with a bunch of useful sidebar navigators and better view-switching.
Also, it’s all-ODF.
There’s some interesting business model innovation;
although Neo is GPL’ed, you have to sign up and pay to join the

are slaving away over performance, because it’s pretty slow at the moment.</p>

<p>I’ve been accumulating things Atomic to write about for a while, so
here goes. 
<i>Item:</i> You’ll be able to blog from 
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/joe_friend/archive/2006/05/12/595963.aspx">inside
Microsoft Word 2007</a> via the Atom Publishing Protocol.
<i>Item:</i> Sam Ruby has 
<a href="http://perkypants.org/blog/2006/04/26/sweet-planet-action/">wrangled Planet</a> to the point where it handles
Atom 1.0 properly.
<i>Item:</i> Along the way, Sam
<a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/05/06/Keeping-Keith-Richards-Company">reported</a>
a common bug in Atom 1.0 handling, and his comments show it being fixed all
over (Planet, MSN, and Google Reader, but not Bloglines of course);
the Keith reference in Sam’s title is to
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/05/31/KeithPlus">this</a>.
<i>[Update:
<a href="http://www.agileprogrammer.com/eightytwenty/archive/2006/05/12/14641.aspx">Gordon Weakliem extirpates</a> another common bug 
from the NewsGator universe.]</i>
<i>Item:</i> The Movable Type
<a href="http://www.majordojo.com/personal-projects/announcing_feed_manager_for_movable_type.php">Feed

<p>Friday Slide Scan #31 is a 1992 fireside shot, with a candle 
and a secret added bonus.</p>
<img src="1547.jpg" alt="Domestic bliss; fireplace, candle, cat" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Bonus</h2>
<p>What’s that dark shape on the carpet in front of the fire?  Is that an ear
sticking up?  Yep, this isn’t just a Friday Slide Scan, it’s
Friday catblogging too!</p>
<p>Images in the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1953
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>, 
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/08/11/MomsGarden">Jean Bray</a>, Tim Bray, Cath
Bray, and
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>; when I know
exactly who took one, I’ll say.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using
a Nikon CoolScan 4000 ED scanner and cleaned up by a combination of the Nikon
scanning software and PhotoShop Elements.</p>

<p>They asked me to plug this
<a href="http://www.sun.com/desktop/workstation/ultra20/javaone/index.jsp">SDN
promo</a> on the Ultra 20 and, since I actually
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/10/18/New-Computer">use one</a>, it
seems like a reasonable thing to do.  
I’m kind of out of touch with what workstations
are supposed to cost, but unless we’re charging way too much, 35% off
should be decent.  And while I didn’t pay for mine, I can personally testify
that these puppies are meat-grinders, it’s by a long shot the fastest personal
computer that I’ve ever used.  Mind you, it won’t enhance the decor of your
office.  And if you get one, take my advice and run
<a href="http://www.gnusolaris.org/">GNU/Solaris</a> on it.

on how you actually get the box, or what it costs.  Blush.  Will ask

<title>What Matters</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Let’s consider Flickr, del.icio.us, and Technorati as
canonical “Web 2.0” companies.  Let’s suppose that Flickr is popular because
it’s a good way to organize and publish pictures, which is useful.  
And that del.icio.us is popular because it’s a good way to
organize and publish links, which is useful. 
And that Technorati is popular because it’s a good way to
find out what people are saying right now, which is useful.
And let’s suppose that the facts that they all do tags and are frequently
described in sentences that include the word “social”, just suppose those
things are ephemeral, and the success is about doing useful things for
individuals.
How old-fashioned.
Every day that goes by I believe more and more that the only
important new thing is that the Net is 
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/stern?entry=web_2_0_in_three">read-write</a>.
Everything that matters follows from that.</p>

<title>Comments Please</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I hope soon to begin implementing a comment system for 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span>.  This space is my notebook where I’ll work
out the design.
Since, as of this writing, the system exists only in theory, if you have a
suggestion you’ll have to send me an email.  I’ll publish the helpful ones.
<i>[Update: Tons of super-intelligent comments, informed by (sometimes bitter)
experience.  Thanks!
I’ll publish them, but a couple of things emerge.  First, I do
have to plan to fight spam.  Second, I should have a look at
<a href="http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/camping/">camping</a>.]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Goals</h2>
<p>First, I think <span class='o'>ongoing</span> would be better with 
comments.</p>
<p>Second, I’d like to take this occasion to learn at least one new
technology.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>General Outline</h2>
<p>For every <span class='o'>ongoing</span> fragment, there will be a little
directory tree, containing one subdirectory each for <i>incoming</i>,
<i>rejected</i>, and <i>accepted</i> comments.  The comments will live in
these directories, one file each, with long names consisting of a timestamp
and a random number.  These directories will generally not be
publicly Web-accessible.</p>
<p>All comments will always be moderated.
There will be a simple Web interface offered to people to compose comments,
and another 
for me to use to approve or reject them.
I’m not inclined to building a safe HTML editing control from scratch, but
will look around for components that will let people compose somewhat-rich
comments without involving extra work or risk.</p>
<p>Comments may be submitted and (while still in the <i>incoming</i>
directory) deleted or updated using the Atom
Publishing Protocol, although I’m not sure how useful that will be.</p>
<p>Every time a batch of comments is accepted, all the accepted comments will
be built into a static Web-accessible page and a small XML file will be
created containing the 
number of comments; this will be used to decorate the body of the fragment via
XMLHttpRequest.</p> 
<p>There will be no built-in authentication system, because the Internet has
enough of these.  I will, however, eagerly participate in any shared-identity
system that seems standardized and doesn’t feel like a vendor land-grab.
The use of such a system might make the Atom Protocol useful rather than
incidental.</p>
<p>The comments will be threaded; that is to say, you will be able to attach a
comment either to an <span class='o'>ongoing</span> fragment or to another
comment.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Issue: Release?</h2>
<p>I will never release the
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Colophon">core publishing software</a> for
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> to the world,
simply because I wrote it in a big hurry and with no other objective than
supporting my idiosyncratic writing workflow.
However, if this comment system proves to be useful and generally applicable,
I’ll consider releasing it.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Issue: Spam</h2>
<p>I suspect that I will not be subject to serious, automated, large-scale
spam attacks, simply because the number of instances of the system will,
initially, be one.
However, because I <em>might</em> decide to release it, I will design in a
plugin-based spam-fighter module.</p>
<p>I have some ideas about spam-fighting approaches that I haven’t seen anyone
else try.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Issue: Platform</h2>
<p>I am subject to the seductive emanations from the Rails Rabble, and one
of the reasons I thought I’d do this was to learn it.  Having said that,
try as I might, I don’t see why I’d need to use a database, and Rails’ sweet
spot is generally considered to be database-backed apps.
On the other hand, I have an intuition that in a few years, Ruby the
language is going to loom larger than Rails the framework; so I definitely
want an excuse to get up close and personal with the language.</p>
<p>So, I dunno; does Rails offer enough other good things to make it an
attractive choice even if you don’t need a database?
There’s all that model/view/controller goodness, but
I’ve always found the MVC approach a little more
attractive in theory than in practice.  </p>
<p>Hmm... the jury is out.  Is there another framework whose sweet spot is a
little less database-centric?
Or is Rails the way to go?</p>

<title>Q&amp;A</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>In the opening session at NetBeans day, Jonathan Schwartz said a few words
and then brought Rich Green, our new software supremo, up on stage.  After
saying some nice things about Rich, Jonathan proposed that they do a Q&amp;A,
with Jonathan asking the questions, saying a “I’ll simulate a developer”.  
His first
question was “So Rich, are you going to open-source Java?”  Rich started with
“Well, why not?”  But then he gave what I thought was a really transparent
brain-dump on the internal debate here at Sun, which is along the lines of
“Open source good, compatibility <em>essential</em>”.  So it’s going to take a
lot of work to figure out the story around compatibility and community, and
that’s going to require plenty of input from outside Sun.  But then Rich
said it again: “Why not?”</p>

<title>Java One Day Zero Podcast</title>

<p>I accosted a bunch of people and asked them three questions: “Who are you
and what do you do?”,  “What’s great?”, and “What sucks?”
Herewith the resulting video podcast, one minute 45 seconds in length.
It started out high-def and even though it’s only 400x225, it looks pretty
decent for Web video.  There’s a cost: it’s about 93M in size.
<i>[Several have written me to point out that this is insanely large.  Well
yes, I know.  I won’t compromise on quality for the same reason that I won’t
compromise on JPEG settings for the images I publish here; but I’ve seen some
suggestions for how I might save space without sacrificing it.]</i></p>
<p>Today’s crowd is mostly Sun employees; I’ll try to branch out more in
future days.

<title>Continuations and GUIs</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Gilad Bracha asks
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/gbracha?entry=will_continuations_continue">Will
Continuations Continue?</a> in an excellent essay about whether the JVM needs
continuations.  Personally I have never found them idiomatic so I have no
quarrel with Gilad’s reluctance, but I entirely disagree with the line of
argument he uses to back it up.  He points out that Web frameworks like
<a href="http://www.seaside.st/">Seaside</a> make excellent use of
continuations, but argues that that’s a red herring because the current style
of Web-human interaction is a temporary anomaly and “the future of Web apps
will be different”, with AJAX signposting the way.
This notion, that the Web GUI is insufficiently interactive and we need
something richer, is widely held among developers and almost never among
actual <em>users</em> of computers, and it’s entirely wrong.
I can remember when people were forced to use compiled Windows and X11
applications, and most of them were extremely bad because it’s really hard to
design a good interactive UI; when the Web came along, more or less everyone
abandoned those UIs in favor of the Web, almost instantly and with shrieks
of glee.  Yes, Web UIs are drastically constrained, offer a paucity of
controls, and enforce a brutally linear control flow; and <em>these are
good things</em>.
I remember, in the early days, people saying “Once you know
how to use one Windows app, you know how to use them all”.  Ha ha ha.
But you know what?   Once you know how to use a browser, you are well on the way
to being able to use most Web apps.
The best AJAX apps are still very Web-like (as in, the Back button always
works); but they’re faster and more responsive and nicer to look at.
The worst AJAX apps are like bad Nineties VB.
Having said all that, I suspect that Gilad’s right about continuations.
<i>[Update: More good stuff on the subject from
<a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2006/05/20/24599.aspx">Don
Box</a> and (especially)

Megginson</a>.
Plus a few remarks, in a superior tone, along the lines of “That silly man,
can’t he see that users really want more complex user interfaces?”  All, of
course, from developers.]
[Further: Some pro-complex-interface remarks that are actually coherent from
<a href="http://www.psynixis.com/blog/?p=145">Simon Brocklehurst</a> (but
Simon, a good browser should pre-fill forms for you and get it right almost
all the time; Safari does).  And there’s more solid thinking in

know who writes it but he seems to be trying to hide his identity, hmm.]

Poe</a> says I’m a Sapir-Whorf victim, I don’t feel the need for continuations

<title>Comments on Comments</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last week I started
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/05/15/Comment-System">sketching a design</a>
for a commenting system, and asked for feedback.  I got lots, and I’m
reproducing it here.</p>
<h2 id='p-24'>Sam Ruby</h2>
<p>His piece
<a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/05/15/Comments-Please">Comments
Please</a> has lots of good stuff and, of course, lots of good comments.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Walter Higgins</h2>
<p>I think adding comments to ongoing is a mistake. What's wrong with good ol' email ? 
Anyone who wants to contact you about an article will use it (I know I have in the past). If you add comments you'll end up doing one of two things...</p>
<ol>
<li><p>fighting spam because the feedback threshold is too low</p></li>
<li><p>ticking off honest commenters because the threshold is too high.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes - ongoing is a bit of an anomaly in that it's one of the few blogs which doesn't support comments. But that's part of it's charm.</p>
<p>Good luck anyway, whatever you decide to do.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Rimantas Liubertas</h2>
<p>glad to know you are going to implement comments for your blog, I think this is long overdue--at least I missed this ability more than couple of times.</p>
<p>So, my humble suggestions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Framework: do try Rails. I am not sure, how this will work w/o database, but other parts of rails are nice too, so, give it a try.</p></li>
<li><p>A couple of things I'd like to try out for comments myself.
These may be "nice to have" features or a complete overkill, but I find them
interesting anyway.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>One is behavior which was called "playing dead" by Joel Spolsky [1],
a way to deal with spam and unacceptable posts in forums:</p>
<p>"Show it to the original poster, so he feels smug and moves on to the next inappropriate discussion group. But don't show it to anyone else.
Indeed one of the best ways to deflect attacks is to make it look like they're succeeding. It's the software equivalent of playing dead."</p>
<p>I think it is good for moderated system too.</p>
<p>Another is the limited time window, just a few minutes after posting
a comment, when poster has the ability to edit the comment. Some may
enjoy the possibility to correct nasty typos which would be stuck otherwise...
</p>
<p>As for HTML in comments I'd consider using Markdown on Textile.
Both have ports to Ruby (BlueCloth and RedCloth).</p>
<p>Looking forward to see your system in action :)</p>
<p>Regards,<br/>
Rimantas<br/>
<a href="http://rimantas.com/">http://rimantas.com/</a></p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Bob Aman (1)</h2>
<p>I'd recomment using a version 1 UUID instead for the filenames of
comments.  RFC 4122 if you feel like a long read.  Has the added
advantage of being ideal for use within the id field of any comment
feeds.  It is my opinion that, in general, comments should be
abstracted as a related data structure to posts whenever possible.
Ideally as either a sibling class or a child class.  Makes a lot of
tricky things very easy.</p>
<p>In any case, a version 1 UUID contains a timestamp, a random number,
and the MAC address of the computer that generated it.  Ideal for what
you're trying to do, if a bit hard to parse.</p>
<p>I'd encourage the use of Textile markup for rich HTML entry.  Just be
sure to have some kind of preview option, because it confuses the heck
of people sometimes.</p>
<p>Anyways, glad you're enabling comments.  It'll be nice to break the
monopoly that hoodwinkers currently have on commenting on your blog.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Bob Aman (2)</h2>
<p>-grumble-</p>
<p>This'll teach me to shoot off an email before finishing the reading of
the blog post in question.</p>
<p>Since you're thinking about writing it in Ruby (which I didn't
realize), I suppose I'll shamelessly plug my UUIDTools library:</p>
<pre><code>require 'rubygems'
require 'uuidtools'

comment_uuid = UUID.timestamp_create.to_s
# => "c4c5cb40-e47b-11da-8552-00112486f05c"

uuid = UUID.parse(comment_uuid)
uuid.timestamp
# => Mon May 15 21:31:59 EDT 2006
uuid.mac_address
# => "00:11:24:86:f0:5c"
uuid.version
# => 1</code></pre>
<p>Also, now, that I'm looking at my code again, I may have been wrong, I
think version 1 UUID don't have a random number component, but since
they're guaranteed to be universally unique across all computers, I'm
assuming that shouldn't be an issue.  Version 4 UUIDs, however, do
have a random number component.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Robert Hahn</h2>
<p>I just read your post about noodling out a comment system. The use of Rails sounds surprising, and I had a couple of comments to share.</p>
<p>I understand that you don't want to use any sort of DB infrastructure for the system, and you know what? I think that's very easy to do.  As you know, files that are stored in the model directory generally looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Comment &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
...
end</code></pre>
<p>And that would be how you'd normally invoke the DB infrastructure.  Well,  there's nothing that keeps you from writing something like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Comment &lt; File
...
end</code></pre>
<p>which would allow you to create a class that inheirits from File, extended by all the methods that you would want.  Even better, you could create your own set of objects that did exactly what you want, save them in the vendor/ directory, and it would become part of the search path if you want to extend it as part of your model.  Your model might then be:</p>
<pre><code>class Comment &lt; Tims_Comment_Infrastructure
...
end</code></pre>
<p>As you can guess, you'll be giving up a lot of functionality that ActiveRecord has, but given that you're working in a completely different domain space, you're probably better off writing code specific to that domain instead of trying to use ActiveRecord in a way it's not designed to be used.</p>
<p>Now, when it comes time to use your Comment model in the controller, it's as simple as doing something like this:</p>
<pre><code>def post_comment
	c = Comment.new(params[:comment])
	...
end</code></pre>
<p>Rails automatically handles any require's that would be, um, required to load up the model for you.</p>
<p>So.  Hopefully you can see that this would be fairly trivial to do.  Here's my other comment.</p>
<p>You might want to consider using TurboGears, which is a Python based interpretation of Rails.  What's cool about TurboGears is that it's built on best-of breed infrastructure that has already been built and maintained separately. I have not used this, and cannot comment on it on a technical level, but I have read about one shop that uses TG for all their work; they like it because if a site doesn't require a DB, they can simply drop it and still enjoy the advantages the framework has to offer.  Sounds pretty good to me, if it's true.</p>
<p>Thought I'd share this as well:  I'm actually taking a look at a microframework called Camping[1], written up by why. it's fantastically minimalist, and could be a good fit for you as well. That said, it's so new, people are having a bit of trouble figuring out how to unwire the DB or templating engine from it - it's possible, I'm sure (I'm wanting to use it w/o the DB engine myself), but most people simply aren't sure how that works precisely. I point this out only because it sounds to me like you're more interested in learning Ruby than Rails, and the one compelling advantage that Camping has is a much simpler deployment (think on the level of a cgi) phase.</p>

<p>For your comment system, do what Norm does for comments: he lets people
type arbitrary HTML (and expands blank lines into &lt;p> so that plain text
paragraphing works too) and then runs it through TagSoup and an XSLT
script that only keeps the tags and attributes he trusts.  Contrary to
what his input form says, href *is* permitted on a elements.</p>

<h2 id='p-9'>Eric Dobbs</h2>
<p>My experience is with Movable Type 2.6ish.  As such I was hammered with automated spam attacks.  I agree that your homegrown code is a less likely target, but though I'd share anyway.  I spent a fair amount of time hacking the MT comment system in an effort to stem the flow of comment spam.  Though I eventually just shut comments down, there's one thing that made me mostly happy.</p>
<p>I left in the email notification MT sends for comments while disabling the writing of comments to the database.  That gave me two principal benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I could just delete the spam in Mail.app (where I'm accustomed to such stuff) and I could skip having to touch MT.</p></li>
<li><p>It also meant I could re-use Mail.app spam filtering which has been rather thoroughly trained in what I think of as spam.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>What I didn't finish before I shut down the comments was a system allowing me to publish the comments via a reply to the notification.</p>
<p>I'm still interested in the general idea of re-using one well-trained spam filter for many of the in-bound streams of data in my digital life.  Not sure that email is the right interface for that, except for the fact that I'm in Mail.app probably more often than any other application.</p>

to use Rails, and since I've been (luckily enough) using it for the
past 10 months on my day job, I could surely be amongst them.</p>
<p>But I'm not.</p>
<p>Rails is great, very well designed, written and mantained. It's a
great way to get applications up and running quickly. And there's no
doubt Rails apps do very well in production.</p>
<p>But when it comes to minimalistic, personal applications, such as the
comment system of your blog, I think you'll soon notice and be
uncomfortable by the fact it's got simply way too many files. Rails
apps unfortunately still resemble J2EE apps in this aspect, no matter
how concise and well organized they try to make it.</p>
<p>Not every programmer will share this concern, but if you are like me,
you'll want to keep your applications to only a few files, in a
directory tree as simple as possible. So what I'm saying is, Rails is
great for big applications, but if you're doing a personal system,
give Camping[1] or web.py[2] a whirl.</p>
<p>Camping wraps all Rails functionality in a single file and lets you
build full applications using also a single file. Same thing with
web.py. In fact, at work (Blogamundo.com), I've two main trunks of
code, one for our web user interface, which is built in Rails, and one
for a series of tiny Python daemon services that talk to the Rails app
via HTTP/JSON. I did this[3] initially because I wanted to use Mark
Pilgrim's Universal Feed Parser for our system and there was nothing
close to that written in Ruby.</p>

<p>This is an advocacy piece for Python and Django 
(<a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">http://www.djangoproject.com/</a>). Here's why.</p>
<p>I've been using Python, and doing web programming, since 1999. I think
Python is a better choice than Ruby for a dynamic language, for reasons of
clarity and popularity, RoR hype notwithstanding.</p>
<p>I've been using a number of Python web frameworks through the years,
including Zope2, some Zope3, Quixote, Twisted, and Nevow. Recently I
discovered Django: it definitely feels like a better tool than the
aforementioned ones, at least for CMS, publishing-oriented web applications.</p>
<p>Is it better than RoR? I don't know, but it seems to be at least on the
same level:</p>

<p>Django and Rails
<a href="http://www.jacobian.org/2005/aug/16/django_and_rails/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Django is at the same time tightly integrated and modular, with a distinct
REST feel. Bill de hÓra, among others, is using it without database, and
with RDF:</p>

<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-users/browse_frm/thread/8cbc50fe8d81d63b/b740b0a9a1a29594#b740b0a9a1a29594">here</a>.</p>
<p>A final, less relevant note. Since discovering Twisted in 2003, I've been
an asynchronous events rabid fanatic, despising preemptive multithreading.
Well, Django does not support asynchronous events, while it does support
multithreading, but I feel compelled to use it just the same. It's that good.</p>
<p>My web site (URL below) is not built with Django. Yet. It will be soon. :-)<br/>

<p>You should take a look at Demokritos. From the project page:</p>
<p>"Demokritos is a Python library and content repository implementing
the Atom Syndication Format (RFC4287) and Atom Publishing Protocol
(draft-ietf-atompub-protocol-08).
Persistence is via a subversion repository."</p>
<p>I don't know how far along it is, though!</p>

<p>As for Rails, I suspect it'll be an overkill for the task. If Ruby is
what you want, then consider Camping (http://camping.rubyforge.org/).
Or web.py (webpy.org) on Python - which I've used and recommend!</p>
<p>And yeah, ongoing does need comments :-)</p>

<h2 id='p-13'>Stuart Langridge</h2>
<p>A couple of comments about comments on ongoing:</p>
<p>First, think about whether you want to ask for people's email
addresses. Most sites don't display a commenter's email, so it's only
of benefit to you specifically, and I personally find it highly
annoying that I have to type my email address into most of the sites
out there to make a comment. URL, fine, and if you need someone's
address to reply privately then it should be fairly easy for you to
find it from the associated URL.</p>
<p>Second, please don't put the comments on a separate page; you're much
less likely to get people reading them if you have to click from your
RSS reader to read the post (which you already have to do, unless I've
missed a full-text syndication feed for ongoing) and then click
*again* to see the discussion.</p>
<p>Can't help you with Ruby, I'm afraid; I'm a Python guy for web apps,
and Wordpress runs my site.</p>
<p>If you're going to have to approve all comments, then please also add
something which says "your comment has been sent for approval" after
posting, since otherwise people think that the browser broke in some
way and post the same comment twice. And, without wishing to be mean
and didactic, approval of everything requires you to stay pretty on
top of it, or it'll kill conversations.</p>
<p>Best of luck!</p>

<p>I just read your post on *finally* implementing spam prevention on
ongoing. You're thought that ongoing wouldn't be the subject of
automated spam attacks is, unfortunately, erroneous.</p>
<p>I implemented a simple commmenting system for the photoblog we have
(<a href="http://fierymill.net/loj/">http://fierymill.net/loj/</a>), which in fact was among the first systems
to support Atom 1.0 in its feeds ;) and thought that comment spam
wouldn't be much of an issue because of the small install base and
relatively few incoming links.</p>
<p>However, I was wrong and quickly implemented a hidden field with a key
that is checked (the key doesn't change). This method worked for several
months keeping the system spam free, but then one morning I woke up to
50 spam messages. Now, while designing a changing key system that
doesn't require any work from the user I've disabled comments from
entries over a week old, which seems to help at the moment.</p>
<p>But, I'm rambling on. My point is, that a small install base will not
prevent you from being the target of automated spam attacks, especially
since ongoing is quite well known.</p>

<p>I've been reading your blog for a while (still readying one of my own), and
I noticed your article about adding comments. There's just one thing, you
almost certainly will get spammed. I set up a simple message board for a
college club a few years ago 
(<a href="http://www.bfeeney.uklinux.net/msgboard">http://www.bfeeney.uklinux.net/msgboard</a> and 
<a href="http://www.ucc.ie/mountaineering">http://www.ucc.ie/mountaineering</a> respectively). It can be configured to force registration or work without it. At the moment, it works without it, as registration was found to put a lot of people off.</p>
<p>However here's the thing: traffic tends to vary from 50 posts a day to 3 acceptable posts a day depending on the time of year, but for at least a year now I've been getting a huge amount of additional comment spam: mainly from bots, but also from people. Yesterday there were 17 normal posts and 46 blocked spam messages.</p>
<p>When this started, I extended the usual nuisance-user blocking to block spam.  I use regexps to block message content, and simple text to block names. Regexps would be better for names, but it was a  lot of work at the time. I've included the code and blocks file in case it's useful. It's all written in Perl: the blocking is taken care of by /mboard-sys/lib/Blocks.pm and the blocking rules are specified in /msgboard/blocks.dat</p>
<p>The other alternative would be to use the Typekey system (<a href="http://www.sixapart.com/typekey/api">http://www.sixapart.com/typekey/api</a>) to force registration, without writing all that user-management code yourself. Typekey is, of course, the exact same idea as Microsoft's passport, but people seem more trusting of it at the moment.</p>
<h2 id='p-18'>Aaron Quint</h2>
<p>First of all, I read ongoing everyday, and Im sure a comments system would be a great addition. (This message, for example, would have been a great candidate for a comment.)</p>
<p>I think you should definitely look into using Rails. Im just getting to a level of proficiency with Ruby and Rails myself, and I can tell you its the most fun I've ever had with any sort of framework or language. The main reason being, every time you've done something very cleanly and elegantly, you realize there's a way to do it even MORE cleanly and with half the code. There are examples of Rails being used without a database, the new book Rails Recipes (http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr/) even features a section on it. If you wanted to really delve in, I think you could even use ActiveRecord (Rails DB Abstraction) to manage your flat-file comment storage.</p>
<p>In terms of letting people post rich comments you should look into Cal Henderson (one of Flickr's lead developers) lib_filter: 
<a href="http://iamcal.com/publish/articles/php/processing_html/">http://iamcal.com/publish/articles/php/processing_html/</a> (and part 2:  
<a href="http://iamcal.com/publish/articles/php/processing_html_part_2/">http://iamcal.com/publish/articles/php/processing_html_part_2/</a> ). It's written in PHP, but Im sure it wouldn't take much to implement in Java or Ruby as its all just regex parsing. The main idea is that he created a white-list of allowable tags, and then stripped the rest, even the trickier stuff like double quoted and nested &lt;script> tags.</p>
<p>I hope this helps. Thank you for 'ongoing', it has a way of lightening my day.</p>

<p>Since you're Perl-y, and since you're doing such a small thing (Rails,
Django and most other frameworks are heavier (err, have different
sweet spots) than what you want), maybe you'd like HTML::Mason.</p>
<p>I haven't personally used it, but I understand its well-regarded.
del.icio.us runs on it, for example.</p>

<h2 id='p-20'>Don Davies Brackett</h2>
<p>I urge you to reconsider threading your comments.  Not only does it expose you to the management headache of "oops, I intended to reply to that post over *there*, can you move it please?" but it also makes discussions more repetitive and fragmented; different people end up posting the same thing twice or three times over without adding much value, because it's much harder to read everything that's been said when there's clicking involved.  Discussions also tend to be longer-lived without actually progressing, as two people get into a protracted argument that other people occasionally interject into.</p>
<p>I feel like unthreaded discussions selfmoderate a little better too, though
I'm not sure why I have that feeling.</p>
<h2 id='p-21'>Alan Griffith</h2>
<p>KISS when it comes to adding comments. Have people email in comments to
maybe comments@tbray.org. The subject line could contain the URL of which page
to add it to.</p>
<h2 id='p-22'>James A. Robinson</h2>
<p>I'm a reader of your blog, and I was interested in your most recent
entry re comments.  I thought you might be interested in a piece of
Java software I've started to use to transform HTML typed by users
into a semblance of XHTML:</p>
<p><a href="http://home.ccil.org/~cowan/XML/tagsoup/">http://home.ccil.org/~cowan/XML/tagsoup/</a></p>
<p>paired along with something like JDOM (or whatever your favorite XML
manipulation technology happens to be), it's possible to build a piece
of software which puts HTML input into a semblance of order, and can
also filter out the nasty things we don't want to allow (e.g.,
scanning for embedded javascript).</p>
<p>I'll be curious to see how you decide to put together the comment
system. Thanks for sharing your thoughts over the years. :)</p>
<h2 id='p-23'>David Magda</h2>
<p>Most commenting systems ask for name, e-mail, and URL. Some people are hesitant to give out the latter two (especially e-mail). It may be useful to have the fields, but have a checkbox to toggle whether the information should be published publicly. It would be visible to you, but the person in question would have some control over whether things would be available to the world.</p>
<p>Also, having each comment individually address would probably be handy (an obvious feature, but many weblogging systems only have a "#comments" option, with not much more granularity).</p>

<title>On Java One</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I flew out Thursday evening, and I’m sitting here mid-Saturday, still not
100% recovered.  If you make your living in a way that involves software
development, it’s a thing you ought to take in sometime.  Herewith my
take-aways.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>It’s Big</h2>
<p>It’s hard to find anyone you can pin down on how many actual paying
non-camp-follower humans are there, and anyhow, conference organizers lie like
rug merchants on the subject.  But I heard the figure of 14,000 bandied
about, and it sure seemed like more people than last year, and the Moscone was
pretty well maxed out.</p>
<p>Being there, you realize the phrase “Cares about Java” selects an
incredibly huge number of people.  Walking into the echoing vastness of the
opening plenary—always with 
good music playing—the sense of being part of something much bigger
than yourself is overwhelming and, even for a cynic like me, uplifting.
Everyone in this endless, endless room cares about software, and about doing
it right.
After all these years, Java is still a fine thing to be part of.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Who?</h2>
<p>My unscientific sampling method involved accosting people I was standing in
line and sitting at lunch with.  They were mostly IT staff from non-IT
companies; I remember Gallo wines, Bose audio, some insurance companies,
a German bank, a couple of universities, a US spook agency.</p>
<p>They talk about “enterprise architecture” with no hint of irony, but they
worry that they’re not really doing this “SOA” thing and ask around trying to
find anyone who is.
They don’t give a flying fuck whether Java is open-source or
not, and the ones who run it on Linux haven’t had trouble
installing it.   They really, <em>really</em> care about Microsoft
interop, but at the same time they hate Redmond and sneer at
Windows without even being asked.  Equal opportunity: they’ll crap on
WebSphere or Enterprise Java Beans without much provocation.
They like the EE 5 story and are ambivalent about PHP.  A lot of them have
never heard of Ruby or Rails. 
For most, the JCP is a remote castle in the sky, nothing to do with their
reality.
Many are a long way from getting to
the current 5.0 release of Java.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>What’s Good</h2>
<p>Best of all is the passion; lots of 10:30-PM BOF sessions have hundreds of
attendees, and if you want to hoist beers and argue about IDEs or persistence
frameworks till the wee hours, you’ll have lots of company.</p>
<p>Near as I can tell, the technical paper selection and scheduling is done
with a lot of integrity and focus on the user experience, and I don’t detect any
hidden agendas.  Based on what I heard, most talks were good and few sucked.
They work hard to support the presenters in getting their act together
before they get on stage.</p>
<p>The organizers try hard to encourage people to have those
hallway and lunchtime conversations that are what really matter.  And a lot of
those conversations happen.  Some of them are a side-effect of the fact that
you spend a lot of time standing in line, so you might as well talk.</p>
<p>The session logistics—audio-visual, room setup, projectors, and so on—seem
100% fully debugged.  Things start and end on time and the mechanics Just
Work.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>What Sucks</h2>
<p>The presentation police that quality-assure your slides catch some typos,
but then they turned one of my slide titles from “The Jini Rio Framework” to
“The 
Jini<sup><small>TM</small></sup> Technology-based Project Rio Framework”, and
in two places “10<sup><small>10</small></sup>” became “1010”.  That’s
major suckitude.</p>
<p>The size of the thing is beginning to stress Moscone out.  I was
supposed to hustle from the opening keynote to the press-conference room, and
I’m not normally claustrophobic, but trying to press through the jam-packed
hallways had me pretty stressed by the time I got there.
Getting to the sessions involves more standing in line than it should.
But if we outgrow San Fran, I suspect the next step is Las
Vegas, so let’s hunker down and try to live with Moscone for another year or
two.</p>
<p>San Francisco restaurants and bars, near as I can tell, universally have
rock-hard walls, floors, and ceilings, so that the level of
ambient noise is deafening, and after a few days of conference schmoozing and
evenings of restaurant shouting, my vocal cords were reduced to
bloody shreds.</p>
<p>It’s good that the “sponsor keynotes” are called that, so you know
perfectly well that you’re going to hear a pitch from a big vendor who paid
for the privilege, and I didn’t go to any, but I heard a lot of really cynical
remarks from people who did.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Unconference?</h2>
<p>If you’ve been to a camp-style event or unconference, some aspects of the
whole sit-and-listen-to-the-guy-on-the-stage thing start to grate.
The BOFs (and there are lots of ’em) go some way to addressing this problem;
but someone ought to go wild-and-crazy and try something radical.</p>
<p>Maybe a half-day within-the-conference event that’s spontaneously organized by
100 attendees picked at random?
Maybe 50 mini-unconferences in parallel some morning?</p>
<p>How’s this?  Put up a “Speakers’ Corner” video booth and let people record
one-minute rants about anything Java-related; then fill an hour-long keynote
with sixty of the best.</p>
<p>There’s lots to learn from the people on the stage, but the people in the
audience outnumber them by hundreds to one.  A lot of their stories are
going to be worth hearing, too; I know because I heard some.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Would I Go Again?</h2>
<p>Yep, but...  Next time I’m going to spend less time
being a Sun spokesdroid and more time hitting sessions and parties.  Which may
be tough to accomplish, but I’ll do my best.</p>

<title>OSS Java</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Well, the reaction to the statement on an OSS
license for the Sun Java SE implementation has not exactly been a chorus of
huzzahs; 
it’s ranged from “You don’t really mean it” to “You should have done it years
ago” to “lamerz suxx0r neener neener”.  The people working through the
license and community issues need to be aware they’ll be dealing with
unrelenting hostility from their audience.
There’s lots of history here, most of which I don’t know, but nobody seems
surprised at all this.
I have to say, though, the contrast between all that nastiness and the big
happy community glow at last week’s Java One was pretty stark; who are Java’s
friends again?
That aside, I’m still pretty startled about the reaction to the 
<a href="http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2006-05/sunflash.20060516.4.xml">DLJ 
announcement</a>.
I would have thought
that making it a little less painful for GNU/Linux
users to install Java would generally be regarded as a good (not huge, but good) thing—I
know that Simon Phipps, Mark Shuttleworth, Rich Sands, and a bunch of other
people worked damn hard on it—but instead (see
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/webmink?entry=no_monopoly_on_good">Simon</a>), 
it provoked a load of vitriolic 
trash talk.  I’m disappointed.</p>

<title>5✭♫: Wrecking Ball</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/04/24/One-More-Cup-Of-Coffee">last</a> 5-✭
song, Dylan’s <cite>One More Cup of Coffee</cite>, got there in large part due
to harmonies from 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmylou_Harris">Emmylou Harris</a>.
Emmylou’s never
really been a Big Star I think, which is unfair; she’s sung more beautiful
songs beautifully than almost anyone.
<cite>Wrecking Ball</cite>, her 1995 outing with Kanadian Karmick
Konsultant and overproducer Daniel Lanois and featuring lotsa Big Stars, is
perhaps not absolutely her finest work; but it’s what I have on my computer
and it’s very good.
<i>(“5✭♫” series introduction <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music">here</a>;
with <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music#p-1">an
explanation</a> of why the title may look broken.)</i></p>
<img src="wb.png" alt="Wrecking Ball, by Emmylou Harris" class="inline" />
<h2 id='p-1'>The Context</h2>
<p>Emmylou Harris’ voice sounds like nobody else’s; sweet, strong, but always,
even when she was young, a little burr or scratch at the edge, I don’t
know what the technical term is, the kind of thing that would have kept her
off the stage in a more formal era.  
Me, I love it, and it has frequently brought tears to my eyes.</p>
<p>I like her singing by itself, but some of her best
work is as a harmonist; in particular, her handful of duets with Gram
Parsons on <cite>Grievous Angel</cite>, recorded just before his death in
1973, has a special place in many hearts.</p>
<p>I suppose it’s helped her career that Ms. Harris is
ethereally, enchantingly beautiful; but I’m sure I’d be listening anyhow
whatever she looked like.</p>
<p>She’s veered back and forth between country and pop and (in this outing)
alt-rock, and always seems at home.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Music</h2>
<p>Daniel Lanois is most famous as U2’s producer, although he’s also worked
with Dylan, Gabriel, and even recorded his own album <cite>Acadie</cite>,
which I find entirely unlistenable.
He is given to spiritual-sounding incoherent rambling when allowed to speak on
camera, and I often find his taste for globs of random distortion somewhat but
not entirely unlike an electric guitar, placed in the middle of the soundstage
and the middle of the song, perhaps a bit over the top.
Having said that, he’s produced a few records I really like.</p>
<img src="Emmylou-Harris.png" alt="Emmylou Harris" />
<p>On this one, he gets far enough out of the way; although there’s always a
bit of electric ghost drone lurking in the sound, it mostly
works.  The musicians include Lanois, Neil Young, Larry Mullen, Kate and Anna
McGarrigle, Steve Earle, and Lucinda Williams.  Which is good.  There are songs
by Lucinda Williams, Neil Young, Steve Earl, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, and
Rodney Crowell.  Which is very good.</p>
<p>Standouts are Earle’s <cite>Goodbye</cite>, Julie Miller’s <cite>All My
Tears</cite>, Anna McGarrigle’s <cite>Going Back to Harlan</cite>,
<cite>Deeper Well</cite> by Olney/Lanois/Harris, and Crowell’s <cite>Waltz
Across Texas Tonight</cite>.  Then there’s the title track by Neil Young; the
haunting chorus “Meet me at the Wrecking Ball/I’ll wear something pretty and
white” is repeated perhaps a couple too many times, but it’s a great
song.  That’s six standouts in twelve tracks, not bad at all.  I only disliked
one 
(Lanois’ <cite>May This Be Love</cite>) enough to flush it off my disk, and I’m
increasingly picky every month that goes by.</p>
<p>Hmm, I’ve just been going on about production values and musicians and
songwriters and don’t seem to have said anything about the singing, by the
person whose picture is on the front of the record.  I don’t have words for
that stuff, you have to hear it.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Sampling It</h2>
<p>I think this is another one that you just have to buy on CD, because you’ll
be listening to it long after this decade’s DRM stops working, and because while
Lanois’ production may be a little weird, the sound is magnificent; even when
in a few spots it gets a little bit shockingly grungy-sounding behind
Emmylou’s arc of vocal sweetness, it’s very <em>polished</em> grunge.</p>
<p>I see that Emmylou has a new record out, a collaboration with Mark Knopfler
called
<a href="http://www.emmylou.net/atrr.html">All the Roadrunning</a>.  Probably
worth taking a chance on.</p>

<p>I already
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/04/29/The-Rails-Lesson">wrote about</a> how the NetBeans and EE guys are 
learning lessons from Rails.
But when Roman Strobl asked me to look at his latest on
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/roumen?entry=flash_demo_j2ee_has_never">instant
persistence</a>, I realized that they’ve learned the <em>really important</em>
lesson; it’s all about instant-app screencasts featuring guys with cute European
accents.  Dig the way Roman says “scaffolding”.  Clearly Django, Grails,
and the other Web-framework wannabes need to go recruit some appealing
Europeans... now here’s a radical idea: how about a <em>woman</em>?

<title>On Grids</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is an introduction to the state of the art in Grid Computing in
mid-2006.  I start with some definitions and motivation, look at grid
economics, survey the
kinds of infrastructure that are out there now, and touch on future
directions.
The introduction is “brief” in the sense that it does little more than touch
the surface of the subject, but it’s still immensely long for a blog.
<i>[Update: MapReduce is here and multi-node today!  It’s called
<a href="http://lucene.apache.org/hadoop/about.html">Hadoop</a>.]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Defining Terms</h2>
<p>Houston, we have a problem: nobody agrees what “Grid” means.  Check out
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_computing">Wikipedia</a> for
a list of alternative definitions.
Whatever.  I think that the massed Opterons folding proteins in university
computing centers are
grids.  I think the Google and Yahoo data centers handling a kazillion
searches a day are too.  And I think that SETI@Home is too.</p>
<p>So I’m going to be sloppy and use “grid” to mean any scenario where you
want a good way to throw a whole bunch of computers in parallel at a problem,
and you want some infrastructure there to help.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>How I Got Here</h2>
<p>For an application I was thinking of, I needed something like
<a href="http://www.danga.com/memcached/">memcached</a> or
<a href="http://www.prevayler.org/">Prevayler</a> or
<a href="http://www.tangosol.com/html/coherence-overview.shtml">Tangosol
Coherence</a>; a really fast distributed hash table storing data in RAM across
a lot of machines.
I looked at those things and eventually decided they didn’t really meet my
needs, so I built my own.</p>
<p>It worked pretty well <i>(fast!)</i>, but once I was finished I realized the
infrastructure was broken.
I had to pick what machines I was
going to run on and preconfigure the system with static
files.   
Which wasn’t good enough, since I wanted to be
able to add machines to the grid on demand, and to
detect and survive the condition when a machine failed.</p>
<p>So I decided I needed to run it on one of these new-fangled “Grid” thingies
and went looking for infrastructure.  This article details what I found.
I don’t claim it’s complete, just that it represents the results of 
research by a motivated non-specialist.</p>
<img src="Voltaire-ISR-9288.jpg" alt="Voltaire ISR 9288" />
<div class="caption"><p><a href="http://www.voltaire.com">Voltaire</a> Grid Director ISR 9288</p></div>
<h2 id='p-3'>Grids are Great...</h2>
<p>Grids are becoming attractive in a lot of
different scenarios.  One reason is that we’re all generally moving toward
scaling <em>out</em> rather than <em>up</em>; throwing lots of relatively
cheap machines at problems in parallel, rather than trying to use one big
honking mainframe-class box.  The potential wins in flexibility and scaling
are huge; of course, life gets more complex.</p>
<p>Another driving force is one of my favorite mantras: “Memory
is the new disk.  Disk is the new tape.”  (First uttered by
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~Gray/">Jim Gray</a>.)
This is true in a bunch of different ways.  First, memory is several orders
of magnitude faster than disk for random access to data (even the highest-end disk
storage subsystems struggle to reach 1,000 seeks/second).
Second, with data-center networks getting faster, it’s not only cheaper to
access memory than disk, it’s cheaper to access another computer’s memory
through the network.
As I write, Sun’s
<a href="http://www.sun.com/products/networking/infiniband/">Infiniband
product line</a> includes a switch with 9 fully-interconnected
non-blocking ports each running at 30Gbit/sec; yow!
The Voltaire product pictured above has even more ports; the mind boggles.
(If you want the absolute last word on this kind of
ultra-high-performance networking, check out Andreas Bechtolsheim’s
<a href="http://stanford-online.stanford.edu/courses/ee380/060510-ee380-300.asx">Stanford
lecture</a>.)</p>
<p>Don’t forget the disk part of the mantra.  For random access, disks are
irritatingly slow; but if you pretend that a disk is a tape drive, it can soak
up sequential data at an astounding rate; it’s a natural for logging and
journaling a primarily-in-RAM application.</p>
<p>So, why wouldn’t you deploy a grid for every computing platform?</p>
<img src="Jim-Gray.png" alt="Jim Gray" class="inline"/>
<h2 id='p-4'>... Except When They’re Not</h2>
<p>Jim Gray (of Microsoft research, quoted above, pictured here)
published a wonderful paper in 2003 entitled
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/pubs/view.aspx?tr_id=655">Distributed
Computing Economics</a>; the abstract says: “Today there is rough
price parity between (1) one database access, (2) ten bytes of network
traffic, (3) 100,000 instructions, (4) 10 bytes of disk storage, and (5) a
megabyte of disk bandwidth.”</p>
<p>Let’s put that another way: memory space and compute cycles are pretty
cheap.  Disk space is effectively free.  Moving data around in large
quantities is <em>expensive</em>.
In Jim’s case, he’s been working with big astronautical data sets.  When he
wants to send one to a colleague on the other side of the continent, he loads
it onto a desk-side computer stuffed with 250G disks,
puts that in a FedEx box and off it goes.</p>
<p>The take-away is that you’d like to maximize the ratio of the amount of
computation to the amount of data traffic.  The perfect example, of course, is
SETI@Home, in which remote nodes
perform lengthy calculations on tiny chunks of data.</p>
<p>Another approach, of course, is to have the data live <em>in the grid</em>.
Consider a big search engine like Google or Yahoo: the incoming requests and
outgoing  results are modest in size; the data living in the grid
is enormous, but it stays there.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Two Kinds of Grids</h2>
<p>Here’s what real-world grids do today:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Render movies.</p></li>
<li><p>Simulate circuits.</p></li>
<li><p>Predict financial risks and returns.</p></li>
<li><p>Model oil-fields.</p></li>
<li><p>Build Web search indices.</p></li>
<li><p>Search the Web.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>One of these is not like the others.  Items 1 through 5 in the list above
are batch jobs.  This is what a lot of grids do; let’s call them
“batch grids”.</p>
<p>Searching the Web isn’t a batch job at all, it’s online 24x7x365 and will
go on providing this service as long as <em>Homo sapiens</em> is still using
computers.  The notion of a Web search engine “ending” or “completing” is
silly.</p>
<p>Let’s call this kind of grid a “service-oriented grid”.
By definition, a service-oriented grid has to be available, which means you
have to be able to connect to it while it’s running.  Also, for the economic
reasons we discussed above, the data pretty well has to live in the grid.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Batch and Service-oriented Grids Today</h2>
<p>This table groups grid technologies
by batch or service orientation, and also by whether they’re here now and
deployed now, or still largely speculative for one reason or another.</p>

</table>
<p>I’ll touch on each of these and try to end up with a compete-ish picture of
the current landscape.</p>
<img src="mpi2.jpg" alt="MPI Forum logo" class="inline"/>
<h2 id='p-7'>MPI</h2>
<p>It stands for Message Passing Interface, and may be found at
<a href="http://www.mpi-forum.org/">MPI-Forum.org</a>.
MPI was first standardized in 1994, and the current MPI-2 dates from 1997.
It’s a set of FORTRAN and C libraries for doing parallel computing, taking
care of the bookkeeping of moving data around among processes working together
in a grid; it also does parallel I/O.
I looked around and found some talk about Java APIs, but nothing that looked
like it had complete coverage and was being maintained and used.  This isn’t
surprising, because the style of the API is very un-Java.</p>
<p>MPI is by far the world’s most popular “grid” API, in terms of code that’s
actually being run today by real people to do real work.
If you go to any academic supercomputing center, you can bet they’ll be
running a lot of MPI.</p>
<p>It supports several message-passing patterns: point-to-point, broadcast,
and so on.  You can call it synchronously (don’t return until the messages get
there) or asynchronously (launch the message traffic and I’ll go on working).
It’s got language-independent data binding, if by “language-independent” you
mean “FORTRAN and C”.</p>
<p>Here’s a basic C-language call from the 
<a href="http://webct.ncsa.uiuc.edu:8900/public/MPI/">MPI Tutorial</a> at
NCSA.</p>
<pre><code>int MPI_Bcast ( void* buffer, int count, MPI_Datatype datatype, int rank, MPI_Comm comm );</code></pre>
<p>Co-operating programs in MPI lingo are called “Processors”, by which they
mean “processes”.  They live in a named cluster, each identified by an
integer called its “rank”.
In the call above, <code>count</code> items whose type is given by
<code>datatype</code> and which are stored at the address given by
<code>buffer</code> will be copied from <code>buffer</code> in the
processor identified by <code>rank</code> to <code>buffer</code> in all the
other processors in the group identified by <code>comm</code>; it’s a
broadcast operation.</p> 
<p>MPI can group the processes into matrices and sub-matrices to divide the
work up. It also has an interesting “Reduce” operation, which can aggregate
data from many processors, put it through a computation step, and store the
result in one of them.</p>
<p>This provides a natural lead-in to what is probably the single most
important advance in batch grid technology in the last decade; Google’s
MapReduce.</p>
<img src="google-labs.gif" alt="Google labs logo" class="inline" />
<h2 id='p-8'>MapReduce</h2>
<p>This is described in 
<a href="http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce.html">MapReduce: Simplified
Data Processing on Large Clusters</a> by Jeffrey Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat.
It’s an absolutely remarkable piece of work, and I recommend that anyone who
cares about this stuff read it.</p>
<p>The idea is that the programmer provides a <code>map</code> function, which
reads (usually a modest number) of key/value pairs and emits (usually a large
number) of other key/value pairs, and a <code>reduce</code> function, which
takes the map output pairs, aggregated by key, and produces a useful result.
Here’s an example from the paper that shows how you’d use it to count the
number of occurrences of each unique word in a large number of documents.</p>
<pre><code>map(String input_key, String input_value):
    // input_key: document name
    // input_value: document contents
    for each word w in input_value:
      EmitIntermediate(w, "1");

reduce(String output_key, Iterator intermediate_values):
    // output_key: a word
    // output_values: a list of counts
    int result = 0;
    for each v in intermediate_values:
      result += ParseInt(v);
    Emit(AsString(result));</code></pre>
<p>The MapReduce implementation (in C++) is tremendously clever; it uses some
elegant tricks to work around machines which fail in mid-run, machines which
    run anomalously slow, and even bugs that are provoked by weird input
    values.</p>
<p>The benchmark results are impressive: a <code>grep</code> style program
    running on a few thousand CPUs scanned 10<sup>10</sup> 100-byte records,
    extracting 92,000 matches, in 
    80 seconds; and sorted those 10<sup>10</sup> records in 839 seconds	.</p>
<p>MapReduce really represents a qualitative step forward in the state of the
    art.
Java fans will be delighted to hear that Doug Cutting, of Lucene and Nutch
    fame, is 
working on a Java version called
<a href="http://lucene.apache.org/hadoop/about.html">Hadoop</a>.
The benchmark results are
<a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-253">impressive already</a>.</p>
<img src="sungrid.jpg" alt="The Sun Grid" />
<h2 id='p-9'>The Sun Grid Engine</h2>
<p>This is a specialized instance of Sun’s
<a href="http://www.sun.com/software/gridware/">N1 Grid Engine</a> deployed on
    the public-facing 
<a href="http://www.network.com">Sun Grid</a>.
The easiest way to introduce it is to look at how you’d run a simple job, for
    example:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Step1 initializes, reads data file “input.txt”, writes three
    intermediate files.</p></li>
<li><p>Step2 processes them in parallel, writes three output files, no
    cross-dependencies.</p></li>
<li><p>Step3 processes the three output files to generate the final
    output.</p></li></ol>
<p>Let’s assume there are shell scripts <code>step1.sh</code>,
    <code>step2.sh</code>, and <code>step3.sh</code> which run the steps.
You’d create a shell script, say it’s called <code>run.sh</code>, like so:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh 
qsub -N step1                 -b n step1.sh 
qsub -N step2 -hold_jid step1 -b n step2.sh 
qsub -N step2 -hold_jid step1 -b n step2.sh 
qsub -N step2 -hold_jid step1 -b n step2.sh 
qsub          -hold_jid step2 -b n step3.sh</code></pre>
<p>The <code>qsub</code> command does all the work.  Its <code>-b</code>
    argument is for “binary”, in this case the value is always “n” for no,
    since these are scripts.
The the <code>-N</code> assigns a job-step ID, so <code>step1.sh</code> is
    called “step1”.
The <code>-hold-jid</code> argument says not to run until all jobs with the
    named job-step ID have completed.  Note that the last step doesn’t need to
    have a job-step ID because there’s nothing waiting for it to complete.</p>
<p>Then you zip up <code>run.sh</code>, <code>step*.sh</code>, and
    <code>input.txt</code>; you use a Web GUI to submit the zipfile
    to the grid engine, track its process, and,
    when it’s done, fetch the 
    output.  This all works just fine and people
    are running these kinds of jobs right now today.</p>
<p>It’s amazingly reminiscent of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JCL">JCL</a> that we used to use to submit
    punched-card decks to mainframes when I was a kid.  Which is OK; that was
    highly evolved technology and is entirely appropriate for batch-job
    wrangling.</p>
<p>The Sun Grid creates a private subnet, connected to nothing, for each job,
    as well as a private filesystem.  So obviously it’s not service-oriented
    in any meaningful way.  The Grid people are aware that service-oriented
    grids are interesting, but they’re also keenly aware that our grid, in the
    hands of a malicious user, could flatten any given bank in seconds, and
    maybe even give Google a headache.</p>
<img src="ggf_gr_logo.jpg" alt="Global Grid Forum logo" class="inline"/>
<h2 id='p-10'>The Global Grid Forum</h2>
<p>On the net at
<a href="http://www.ggf.org/">ggf.org</a>, this organization first met in
    2001.  It’s big; there are 34 working groups.  They’ve produced a ton of
    specifications, the best known of which are DRMAA and OGSA.</p>
<p>DRMAA is not very interesting.  It provides C and Java interfaces that let
    programmers do more or less what the Grid Engine’s <code>qsub</code> and
    friends do; it’s been implemented on the Sun Grid and in “Project Condor”
    at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p>
<p>OGSA, for Open Grid Services Architecture, is a much bigger thing, an
    attempt to provide standardized general-purpose infrastructure for a
    service-oriented 
    grid.  One of their use cases gives a good flavor for the kind of problem
    they’re addressing, and is interesting.  Imagine a grid
    which is receiving telemetry data from all over the Caribbean: air and
    water temperature, barometric pressure, wind speed.  If you see sudden
    changes in a bunch of these over a 50-square-km area, you need to run some
    large-scale hurricane simulations Pretty Damn Quick to decide whether or
    not to evacuate New Orleans.</p>
<img src="globustoolkit.gif" alt="The Globus Toolkit" class="inline" />
<p>OGSA tries hard to Solve The Whole Problem, and it’s based on the WS-*
technologies; indeed, it is a key contributor to
    <a href="http://www.globus.org/wsrf/">WSRF</a> (Web Services Resource
    Framework).</p>  
<p>There’s another organization, Globus, which actually produces open-source
    implementations of OGSA standards; 
here’s a block diagram of the architecture from their
<a href="http://gdp.globus.org/gt4-tutorial/">online tutorial.</a></p>
<img src="concepts_gt4_arch.jpg" alt="Globus Toolkit architecture" />
<p>To give more flavor, here’s an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing and deploying a WSRF Web Service is easier than you might
    think. You just have to follow five simple steps.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Define the service's interface. This is done with WSDL</p></li>
<li><p>Implement the service. This is done with Java.</p></li>
<li><p>Define the deployment parameters. This is done with WSDD and JNDI.</p></li>
<li><p>Compile everything and generate a GAR file. This is done with Ant.</p></li>
<li><p>Deploy service. This is also done with a GT4 tool.</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not just theory, the Globus toolkit is in release 4 and (they
    claim) is being used by a whole bunch of different academic-research
    projects.</p>
<p>Clearly, there is a remarkable amount of flexibility in this architecture,
    purchased at the price of complexity.  There will also be a runtime cost
    to all the SOAP-packet marshaling and unmarshaling; whether it’s
    significant will be highly dependent on application specifics.</p>
<p>I’m probably the wrong person to come to for an opinion on OGSA and Globus.
    Not only is my antipathy to the WS-* suite well-known, but the specs
    clustering around WSRF have always struck me as particularly offensive,
    since on the face of it they seem to re-implement HTTP (badly) on top of
    SOAP on top of HTTP.</p>
<p>Having said all that, it seems like Globus is an actual
    running, usable instance of general-purpose service-oriented grid
    infrastructure.  In fact, the only one I’ve encountered.</p>
<h2 id='p-11'>Rio</h2>
<p>When I started looking around for grid infrastructure, a bunch of different
    people pointed me at the
    <a href="http://rio.jini.org">Jini Rio Framework</a>.  Here’s its architecture
    diagram.</p>
<img src="Rio.png" alt="The Jini Rio Framework" />
<p>Rio’s introductory text says “Project Rio provides a model to dynamically
    instantiate, monitor &amp; manage service components as described in an
    architectural meta-model called an OperationalString.”
It’s based on multiple layers of abstraction and the documentation uses lots
    of words that I thought I understood in ways that make it obvious they
    mean something different.  To start with, I don’t know what an
    “architectural meta-model” is.</p>
<p>Rio’s sample “Hello World” app has one interface, six classes, and 625 lines
    of code.  Now, to be fair, it’s very complete and and has a nice Swing
    user interface.
Rio provides a lot of facilities that sound like they ought to be useful,
    including help for handling errors and failures in your infrastructure.
It’s pretty clear that understanding Rio is going to take a lot of work, and
    if you’re going to be using something for infrastructure in a large-scale
    high-performance situation, it’s important to understand all the
    layers thoroughly.</p>
<p>I think that Rio has a terrific future, but seriously needs work to reduce
    the barrier to entry.</p>
<img src="rajkumar.png" alt="Rajkumar Buyya" class="inline" />
<h2 id='p-12'>Gridbus</h2>
<p>If you go Googling around for “Service-Oriented Grid” you’re pretty quickly
    going to run up against the work of Prof. Rajkumar Buyya (right) of the
    University of Melbourne, director of the 
<a href="http://www.gridbus.org">Gridbus project</a>.  
Like OGSA, Gridbus is ambitious, but in a different direction. It aims to
    provide an infrastructure that comprises not only the technical
    requirements for doing grid computing, but also an economic model so that
    multiple players can combine dynamically to offer a grid utility,
    competing for  business.</p>
<p>There is apparently a .NET-based implementation of at least part of the
    theory, called
    <a href="http://www.alchemi.net/">Alchemi</a>, which reached 1.0 in
    December 2005.</p>
<h2 id='p-13'>Web-Facing Service-Oriented Grids</h2>
<p>Of course, multitudes of people do grid computing every day, when they
    search at Yahoo! or Google, or shop at Amazon, or use any of a huge number
    of Web-facing services.  Most of which are implemented as grids; it’s the
    only practical way to deal with Web-scale traffic.</p>
<p>The trouble is that these guys all build their infrastructure themselves,
    by hand, down to the metal.  None of them are in the business of offering
    general-purpose grid infrastructure that you can use to run your programs
    on your computers, or even on theirs.</p>
<p>So let’s revisit that table above, 
    adding “Infrastructure” to the title and removing all the entries that
    aren’t in the you-can-use-it infrastructure business:</p>

<h2 id='p-14'>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There are a lot of options out there; this article has reviewed the ones
    that I turned up when I was looking for something to use myself.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I decided that none of them really met my needs.  My problem
    is that I’ve been a Unix guy for twenty years and a Web guy for ten.
    My feeling is that if something says it’s a service, the right way
    to talk to it is to get a
    hostname/port-number combination, call it up, send a request, and wait for
    a response.  My feeling is that a good way to have processes work together
    is for them to exchange streams of text using standard input and
    standard output.  My feeling is that if I’m going to be stressing
    out the performance of an app on a grid, I don’t want too many layers of
    abstraction between me and the messages.  My feeling is that server
    failures are going to have to be handled in an application-specific way,
    not pushed down into the abstraction layer.</p>
<p>So I ended up writing my own piece of service-oriented grid infrastructure,
    named Sigrid, which isn’t like any of the other things in this essay.
    I’ll write that up here soon.</p>
<p>But I’m 100% sure that there are lots of problems out there where one of
    the alternatives described here will do just what you want.</p>

<title>Web 2.0™</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>As someone who’s had a lot of respect for O’Reilly, the person and the
company, for a few years, and as someone who’s run small businesses and who
knows how hard it is to take a vacation, I feel bad about this one.  
Because while you may not always agree with Tim, he’s not stupid, and an
attempt to lock down the term “Web 2.0” at the same time as you’re building
thought leadership around it, that’s stupid.
So I’d urge the world to cut
Mr. O’Reilly some slack till he gets back from vacation.  I also suspect that
the value of Web 2.0™ will be unimpaired; it’s really only used seriously by
VCs and marketers and prognosticators who are by and large unperturbed by
the lawyers’ view of intellectual property, not by the actual hands-on

<title>Multicast</title>

<body>
<p>I’m polishing up Sigrid so I can write about it and (if anyone’s
interested) release it; I switched
<a href="http://platform.jxta.org/">the latest JXTA</a> (2.3.7) in—it lives at
the bottom level so that the grid nodes and clients can
discover each other—and everything broke, don’t know why.  I still think JXTA
is the right answer down the road, but on impulse I cracked open
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/javanut5/">Java in a Nutshell</a> and
Stevens’
<a href="http://www.kohala.com/start/unpv12e.html">Unix Network

and
<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/networking/datagrams/broadcasting.html">multicast</a>.
Damn, multicasting through the Java API sure seems easy.  That same day I
whacked together a
couple hundred lines of code to do simple discovery, with aging even (so
that you forget about things you haven’t heard from in a while) and tested it
on a bunch of computers within easy reach; and it all seemed to Just Work.
There are lots of useful-looking knobs on the side to deal with TTL and
NIC selection and so, but the defaults seem well-chosen.
As long as you’re prepared to deal with the fact that any given message might
not get through, and to spend a couple of minutes
<a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/multicast-addresses">here</a>, it’s
really not very taxing.
I’m starting to wonder why you’d need any layers of abstraction at all.
Question: Do Python/Ruby/Perl/Javascript have these coolio easy-to-use
libraries too?

<title>Yes, I Can Keep Editing!</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I have taken a serious interest in a fairly small number of Wikipedia
entries, on subjects where I think I’m pretty expert, and for some time I
tried to keep on top of them, nuke others’ edits when they were bogus, fix
grammar and spelling problems, trying to achieve what Toyota calls
<i>kaizen</i>, or continuous improvement.
But I can’t any more.  I don’t have time to go check back every day or even
every week, and that’s what a conscientious article minder ought to do.
I totally need, for each article, a feed I can subscribe to that will
summarize changes.  Give me that and I can probably stay on top of a handful
of articles, because <em>most edits are good</em>.
It can’t be that hard; every article already has a
“history” page that has the information right there; all you’d have to do would
be to create an alternate version wrapped in RSS or Atom tags.
So, dear Wikipedians; you want me to invest time and attention in improving
the commons?  Give me tools.
<i>[Hah! And from within the bowels of Wikipedia, a voice emerges, saying:
“Ask and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=T._E._Lawrence&amp;action=history&amp;feed=atom">you

<title>5✭♫: Israelites and More </title>
</head>
<body>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmond_Dekker">Desmond Dekker</a> just
died; I had to do a quick rip on his Greatest Hits so he’d qualify for the 5-✭
treatment.
A lot of people under 45, and a lot of Americans of all ages, won’t know
about Desmond, and you’re missing some pretty good music.
You might only have heard <cite>Israelites</cite> and that’s an outstanding
song, but there are lots more, and a greatest-hits disc is a
no-brainer investment.
<i>(“5✭♫” series introduction <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music">here</a>;
with <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music#p-1">an
explanation</a> of why the title may look broken.)</i></p>
<img src="DD4.jpg" alt="Desmond Dekker" class="inline" />
<h2 id='p-1'>The Context</h2>
<p>Desmond Dekker was the Jamaican music scene’s first shot across the world’s
bow; a precursor of the broadsides from Cliff, Marley, Tosh, Rodney, and all
the rest.</p>
<p>I was living in Lebanon in 1969 and our pop-music scene was pretty well
Europe-driven.  1969 was a good year for music, but on our radios,
<cite>Israelites</cite> was absolutely that year’s biggest hit by any artist,
any genre.</p> 
<p>It was kind of hard to make Desmond out.  His voice was high, sweet,
and melodic, and lots of his songs were romantic love croons. 
At the same time, some of the other songs were Trenchtown snarls about
struggle and poverty (albeit in a patois so heavy that you couldn’t make out
the lyrics) and he started appearing in leathers and rude-boy getup,
including what looked like a belt full of rifle shells slung around the
hips.</p>
<p>He had a string of second-rate hits in the years following
<cite>Israelites</cite>, but never really made much money and went through
bankruptcy.  He was still out there touring to pay the rent right to the end; when I checked his Web site a few days after his death, it
still had links saying “click here to book Desmond”.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Music</h2>
<p>The only Desmond-Dekker disks I’ve ever seen have been 
greatest-hits compilations, all basically with the same songs.
There are two kinds of Dekker song: sweet crooners and proto-reggae funk.
They say that what he played was “Ska” but it just sounds like pop music to
me.
Back then, Kingston rhythm sections sounded fresh, new, and surprising; today,
pop music has so wholly absorbed those idioms that it just sounds like a good,
if a bit unpolished, studio band.</p>
<p>This is basically party music, dance music, and even the weaker songs are
OK because the band is tight and Desmond was a good singer with a good voice;
they could make any plausible tune into something worth hearing.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Wake up in the morning, working for bread, sah<br/>
so that every mouth may be fed;<br/>
Oooh, ooh, Israelites.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s probably still the song that most people come back to; dark-brown funk
harmonies wrapped around a killer rhythm and one of those melodies Germans
call “ear-worms”, Desmond’s voice so on the beat it’ll give you shivers.
Best played loud.  The other Desmond Dekker song that’s
most like <cite>Israelites</cite> is <cite>Ah It Mek</cite> and it even has
words you can understand, except for the title which is Greek (well, Jamaican
Greek) to me.</p>
<img src="DD3.jpg" alt="Desmond Dekker" />
<div class="caption"><p>Mellow fellow.</p></div>
<p>If you want seduction, to be crooned at, check out <cite>I Believe</cite>
or <cite>Rudy Got Soul</cite>. (Er, doesn’t “Rudy” mean gun-totin’ Trenchtown
hoodlum?)</p>
<p><cite>Perseverance</cite> sounds like not unlike a Neville-Brothers crazed
jungle gospel outing: <i>Why can’t we live in unity with our Lord?</i>
There’s also a nice cover of Cliff’s <cite>You Can Get It If You Really
Want</cite>.
But my fave is <cite>Intensified</cite>, a pure empty-headed party rave-up: 
take it out on the floor and shake it baby.
The chorus goes <i>Ram baba looba bam bam ba louie/Ram baba loo bam
bam... <b>Intensified!</b></i>
You could lay Leonard Cohen and Paul Simon and Joni Mitchell and as
many other sensitive singer-songwriters as you wanted end to end, and could
they come up with that?  I think not.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Sampling It</h2>
<p>Sixties Kingston sound is strong and honest and true, but it’s not that
subtle, so getting these on MP3 might be forgivable.
Me, I don’t pirate music, but those who do might point out that whatever you
pay, Desmond ain’t getting any of it any more.
On the other hand, those greatest-hits CDs are pretty darn cheap; mine has
twenty tunes on it, all competent and cheerful, some great, which seems like a
good deal for the $11.99 or whatever I paid for it.</p>

brutal way to format your blog?)  For RAID &amp; filesystem wonks only.
It’s
a lucid, quantitative explanation of the trade-offs between mirroring,
striping, and
RAID-ing.   Some of the narrative is ZFS-specific, but I suspect that the
lessons are pretty general.
Out there in the real world of production applications, you’d be surprised how
often it is, when you’re waiting for a slow app, you’re waiting for the disk,

<title>SavaJe Shakedown</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>At Java One, I purchased the “conference gadget”, a
<a href="http://www.savaje.com/show_device.html">SavaJe Jasper S20</a>.
Since it supports most of Java SE, I thought I’d check out whether
a competent Java developer who knows nothing about mobile issues could make it
do anything interesting.
It’s kinda cute, and it’s an OK phone on my local GSM network.  However, the
software development pack runs only on Windows.  It’s got a camera and shoots
video, but when I plugged the USB into my Mac, the Mac said “unable to use
that disk”
and then crashed a few seconds later.  I have <em>never</em> had a USB
device fail like this on any computer before.  
Also, the phone’s preferences menus are lame and limited, so on the screen,
I can’t keep the network operator name from over-writing the Date/Time display.
Finally, my network provider
requires some

phone doesn’t have a way to set those, so I can’t connect.  I reported this on
the SavaJe developer forums, and some badly-programmed bot pretending to be a
“SavaJe Developer Services Engineer” mindlessly
pointed me at the directions to the phone’s GPRS setup screen, when I’d
specifically stated that that screen didn’t do what I
needed. 
SavaJe might turn out to be a good idea, but they’re doing their best to cover
that up.
<i>[Update: As of sometime over the weekend, an actual human seems to be
having a look at the situation, over at the SavaJe
<a href="http://java.savaje.com/bb/">developer forums</a>.  So let’s see...]
[Update: Got a nice email from Larry Kaye, Manager of Developer Services over at
SavaJe.  Very to-the-point; yes, they know about most of my issues, are
working on them.  That’s all anyone can ask for in a bleeding-edge

<title>Go Visit Phobos</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Hey, I see that
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/robc/">Roberto</a> has pushed some
actual software bits to the
<a href="https://phobos.dev.java.net/">Phobos site</a>.  Phobos is a
server-side scripting framework that runs on the Java platform.  Right at the
moment, it’s all JavaScript, but the hooks are there to wire in other
languages.   I’ve been a major Phobos cheerleader for a year or more inside
Sun, but my only actual contribution is the astronomical logo. 
There were people here who were considerably ambivalent about showing
Phobos to the world, and for good reason; they asked “What <em>is</em> Phobos,
actually?” and wondered about its relationship to the rest of
<a href="http://glassfish.dev.java.net/">GlassFish</a>.  I’m not 100% sure
what Phobos is myself, but it’s interesting as a thought experiment,
showing that you can do the kind of lightweight zero-deployment things that
people don’t think Java does.
The Reddit/Dojo mashup demo is seriously cool.
Finally, while the server-side JavaScript notion is pretty weird, go have a
look at the code; writing an AJAX app all in one language is seductive on the
face of it.</p>

story</a> (it’ll probably vanish behind the paywall) that
introduces each of the people charged. They turn out to be mostly suburban,
mostly Canadian; two of them are actually in jail after pleading guilty
last October to sneaking a couple of guns across the border.
For a moment I wondered if the cops were going overboard, encouraging a bunch
of wannabe-jihadi wankers; but then I realized that these are demographically
an awful lot like the bunch that blew up the London Underground; so it’s
probably an example of good policing.
Even if we manage to stop the bleeding in the Middle
East, some ethnic group somewhere in the world is always going to be 
oppressed and getting beat up; let’s hope the future bombers living among us are as
clueless as this bunch.</p>

<p>I always have a big input queue of things I’d like to write about, but
never enough writing time to drain it.
So I try to spend that time
on things where I’m in new territory or making an original point, rather
than pointing to something out there, however excellent; because anything
that’s worthy of linkage will have picked up some, even if it’s not from me.
In recent months, I’ve noticed that an unreasonable number of things I’d like
to have linked to have been from the
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/">BTL</a> blog over at ZDNet; Farber and
Berlind do a remarkable job of digging out industry trends and events,
and then adding value by saying smart things about them.
And this matters; for a couple of years there I thought the computer trade
press might self-destruct completely.
To be sure, it’s a pathetic shadow of its former self, but I sure hope the
remaining few points of light are self-sustaining; because our business needs
its professional storytellers.  Along with BTL, I rely most heavily on
<a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/">Jon Udell</a> and, these days,
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/index.ars">ars technica</a>.</p>

<title>Stop the Metaphors!</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Rich McManus says the Web is a platform, and 
<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/cease_and_desis.php">reports</a>
that per Arrington, it’s an OS.  I think this whole menagerie of
metaphors around the Web has never been helpful and we should just stop
dreaming them up.
The Web isn’t a platform or a database or an API or an OS a cloud or a
clickstream or any other of those things.
In fact, the Web isn’t even a <em>thing</em>,
it’s a <a href="http://worldofends.com/">mesh of agreements</a> with 
a nice straightforward 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/">engineering rulebook</a>.
Play by the rules and you can be part of it and build something great,
struggle against them and you’ll look lame and you’ll fail. 
But don’t try to analogize it; sometimes
the world has new things in it and you just have to deal with them as 
they are.</p>

<title>Edmonton vs. Carolina</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I was born in 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton">Edmonton</a> and have roots
there, thus I’m firmly partisan in the current
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup">Stanley Cup</a>
championship series;
anyhow the notion of a championship hockey team from <em>Carolina</em> seems
all wrong somehow.
For connaisseurs of hockey and of fine writing you can’t beat
<a href="http://www.colbycosh.com/">Colby Cosh</a>, who bleeds, uh, whatever
colour corresponds to Edmonton.
His hand-rolled duct-taped blogging system doesn’t extend to twenty-first
century fripperies such
as permalinks, but here are temporary links to his coverage of
the five Edmonton-Anaheim games:
<a href="http://www.colbycosh.com/#odkq">1</a>
<a href="http://www.colbycosh.com/#sfpv">2</a>
<a href="http://www.colbycosh.com/#csac">3</a>
<a href="http://www.colbycosh.com/#vsip">4</a>
<a href="http://www.colbycosh.com/#ddna">5</a>.
Cosh’s RSS feed doesn’t actually work to the extent of being able to click on
the entries (in my aggregator at least) but I suspect his write-up on the
current series will be definitive.
He also serves as an existence proof that not all right-wing Albertans are 
parochial hicks.
The first game just ended; the last-minute lapse was appalling, but if
Hurricanes goalie Cam Ward stays that hot, the Oilers are toast anyhow.</p>

<title>Abstract Numbers Yadda Yadda</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Following on the update to the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/22/Binary">binary search piece</a>, I am
in receipt of multiple emails, and the target of multiple web links, all
saying, in a superior kind of tone, “The poor boy, that primitive Java stuff
broke because he doesn’t have auto-magical big numbers like Lisp-n-Smalltalk
had back in the day.”  Thank you for raising my
consciousness.  
If you’ll grant that the trade-off between fixed-size hard-wired datatypes and
more abstract ones has been under discussion since
Turing was a tot, I’ll grant that many attempts to pack the data in
tight are symptoms of premature optimization.
But space-vs-time trade-offs are just not gonna go away; deal with it.
And I’ve had my working set blown to hell more than once trying to build the
parse tree for what seemed like a moderately-sized incoming message, in a
language that turned out to be just a little too high level.
And the “My thought-experiment language solved that in 1976” mantra is
<em>boring</em>.</p>

<p>The Microformats kids all have really great hair, and 
the coolest acronyms; still, up till now, it’s all only occasionally seemed 
plausible to me.
But this new Technorati microformat search thing, I look at
it and for the first time really think “This could be big”.  For example,
look at
<a href="http://kitchen.technorati.com/event/search/vancouver">kitchen.technorati.com/event/search/vancouver</a>
(even the URI is interesting).  It looks like some “sort-by” buttons and
authority and keyword filters would improve things; and if this
catches on some Monday the spammers will be there by Wednesday.
But still, we could be seeing it happen: small pieces combining to
produce something really, really big.

<title>Newborn</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Now we are 4.
Last Thursday 
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren</a> and I became parents of
a bouncing 9lb 7oz (big!) baby girl. 
She’s fine, Lauren’s fine.  As a matter of policy, our children’s names and
photos don’t appear here, so instead of saying “the kid” it’ll have to be “the
boy” or “the girl”.  Well, we decided to make one exception; how can
a cute-baby photo do any harm?
Plus, as a service to the loyal readers of <span class='o'>ongoing</span>, 
a dozen facts about newborns and their context.</p>
<img src="IMGP3381.jpg" alt="Daughter, age three days." />
<div class="caption"><p>The daughter, aged 3½ days.  
This picture is a little bit deceiving
because newborns don’t actually smile; but a lot of random expressions chase
themselves across the tiny face, many driven by sensations from the belly
(gassiness, emptiness, repletion). This is one of those.</p></div>
<p>Those who are parents will already know these facts, and
perhaps enjoy a moment of nostalgic glow.  For non-parents, a glimpse into
another planet.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The unpleasant parts of the pregnancy, birth, and baby-wrangling
experiences fade fast from memory, amazingly fast.  Otherwise the species
would have died out
one generation after the arrival of birth control.</p></li>
<li><p>White newborns look like Winston Churchill.  East Asian ones look like 
venerable monks.  South Asian ones look like actual children, with beautiful
eyes.  The complex we were in had no African babies.  This being
Vancouver, there were a few ethnically-mixed little citizens; some combos work
better than others.</p></li>
<li><p>Newborns can’t really see you; they haven’t mastered the technique of
pointing and focusing their eyes.  When they accidentally achieve focus on
something in the room, they get this hilarious look of wide-eyed
astonishment.</p></li>
<li><p>When you’ve got a kid and you look at their newborn photos, you can see
the roots of what their faces have become.  
It doesn’t work the other way though; when
you look at a newborn’s face there’s no way to tell what it’ll come to look
like.</p></li>
<li><p>Newborn poop doesn’t smell.  It however is visually dramatic,
progressing in a few days through the slimy black of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meconium">Meconium</a> through some
surprising greens to the inoffensive, slightly sour-smelling yellowish
diaper-loads of the breast-fed.</p></li>
<li><p>Every parent worries about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_infant_death_syndrome">SIDS</a>, 
which is what they call it when a baby stops breathing and nobody knows why.
Newborns are scary because they’re unpracticed at breathing, and often make
unnerving sounds: choking, hacking, and snorting.  When they’re in a
deep milk-befuddled sleep, they move hardly at all and you can’t hear their
breath no matter how close; I’m sure every parent has stroked a
sleeping baby’s face, or tickled its finger, just to make sure it’s
breathing.</p></li> 
<li><p>The process of having a baby and eventually getting it home involves
contacts with many flavors of medical professional. (Our experience at
B.C. Women’s Hospital was smooth, professional, and caring).  However,
it exists in a flow of time disjoint
from that we normally experience.  Whenever a medical professional leaves the
room saying “I’ll be right back” or “Dr. Haddad will be in to have a
look”, time stops; for a period that is wildly unpredictable but never less
than 45 minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>The senior nurses that run the shifts in the post-natal units are like
Zen masters; their depth of knowledge and centeredness are
awe-inspiring.  They see things the doctors don’t.</p></li>
<li><p>The arrival of a newborn switches you in 24 hours from a normal human
being to a shuffling sleep-deprived zombie.  I’m easing off a bit at work
(must figure out how to book a few days of parental leave to make up for the
loss of intensity) but there are a still a couple of work things I’m doing
that I think are important.  The trick is to seize a moment when you realize
that your brain is actually working right, and the baby’s asleep, then get
something done.</p></li>
<li><p>Each one’s different!  The new girl has this powerful, repeatable reflex
that the boy didn’t; whenever you touch her around the ankle or foot, her
knees bend and she tries to retract her legs.  This makes putting the diaper
on a chancy business.</p></li>
<li><p>Parents tend to generalize about the differences between “little boys”
and “little girls”.  I think that most such differences would melt away in the
harsh light of statistical evidence; but I think I know why we do this.
People who aren’t parents look at babies and wouldn’t know the gender if they
weren’t dressed in blue or pink.  But parents spend, in aggregate, many boring
hours unclothing, cleaning, and re-clothing little genitals; staring blankly
at your baby’s crotch while wondering “Why <em>does</em> he/she do that?” has
likely been the source of much gender-based folklore.</p></li>
<li><p>When you’ve got a newborn in your lap, most of the time it’s either
asleep or cranky or has a bellyache.  There are a few moments when it’s
actually awake and comfy and just looking.
There aren’t many times you get to go one-on-one with an intelligent
being just arrived on Planet Earth; cherish it.</p></li>

<title>2006 World Cup</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Well, if you’re going to spend three days in a hospital room with a
recovering wife and an adjusting newborn, the first few days of the World Cup
are the time to do it; I’ve watched six of the first nine matches.
Soccer isn’t my favorite spectator sport, but I’m a
sucker for a Big Occasion, and sports-wise, this is the biggest.  Plus the
matches look so great, the flower-bright uniform colours and the arc of the
ball in the German sunshine.  I totally recommend catching a few, it’s
first-rate TV.
Herewith some comments on the early going.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Germany 4 Costa Rica 2</h2>
<p>I was unimpressed by the Germans.  The underdogs came to play
and it wasn’t clear the hosts did.  It may seem lunatic to question a team’s
offense when they get four goals, but first, that CR defense was
pretty flimsy stuff, and second, two of the goals were on big outside-the-box
circus shots, hardly the stuff of winning campaigns.</p>
<p>As to defense, if a team like CR, with only one credible offensive
threat, can use it to shred the German offside trap like toilet paper twice in
one game, what’s going to happen when a team with a real multi-pronged offense
gets down to business?</p>
<p>Having said all that, the Frings goal was pure demonic poetry.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Ecuador 2 Poland 0</h2>
<p>Paint me in Ecuador colors, I’m a fanboy.  
The result was no
fluke; the Poles were cleanly out-run, out-passed, out-shot, and out-coached.
Ecuador played attacking ball and never let up; their match with 
Germany on June 19th is going to be totally must-see.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>England 1 Paraguay 0</h2>
<p>The one thing I can say for England is that it wasn’t really an “own goal”;
if Beckham gets that much pace and twist on that shot from that location ten
times, it’ll be in the net three or four, doesn’t matter that much who touched
it last.
But then they went to sleep, big slow triangle pass patterns in midfield, no
movement, no inspiration, nothing.
After a half hour of that, I was rooting for Paraguay.  If England can win
playing that style, soccer is dead.</p>
<p>And then there were the Mexicans dressed unconvincingly as officials; maybe it
looked better from on the field, but through the TV screen it seemed like rank
anti-England partisanship.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Trinidad &amp; Tobago 0, Sweden 0</h2>
<p>An unqualified triumph for T&amp;T, and good on ’em.  You can say that
the Swedes were off their form, and you’d be right.  You can say that T&amp;T
only had one serious scoring chance in 90 minutes, and you’d be right.</p>
<p>But you’d also have to note that Shaka
Hislop faced the dreaded Ibrahimovic three times at point-blank range and sent
Zlatan away empty, and you can’t say that about many keepers in any
league anywhere.  That was remarkable defense.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Argentina 2, Cote D’Ivoire 1</h2>
<p>I guess the Argentinians deserved to win, which is a pity, because the
Africans were sure a whole lot more fun to watch; there’s nothing quite like
Drogba in full flight when he’s got his good game going.  First-rate
entertainment.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Mexico 3, Iran 1</h2>
<p>If I had to pick a team as a personal favorite, it might be Mexico.
They’re in Canada’s qualifying group, along with a pocketful of tiny Central
American nations; the result is that Mexico usually gets to go to the
tournament, then it depends whether Canada can beat El Salvador or vice versa,
a near-run thing.  But we get to know the Mexicans a little.</p>
<p>By the end of the first half, I was thinking about becoming an Iran fan.
Both sides played well, but the Iranians with more more fire and passion.
And I’m 100% hetero so the wrong person to judge, but did anyone else think
the Iranians looked just great?  Hawk-faced, pale-skinned, raven-haired, with
the brilliant red uniforms?</p>
<p>Both sides went to sleep in the second half.  None of the commentary I’ve
read has come out and admitted that two of the three Mexican goals were really
pretty soft, the Iranian back line and (especially) keeper being fooled
way too easily.
Still, the Mexicans are a team to watch.</p>

But then this morning they spammed me.  Any email that lands in my

spam.  I conclude that PodTech needs some help; there’s something deeply, um,
what’s the word I’m looking for here, to describe announcing a move in the
blogging space by spamming press releases?  Let’s use “wrong”.  Some excerpts:
“PodTech.Network Inc., a leading emerging-media company ...
‘Robert Scoble is a global brand and we are thrilled to have him

platform of Fresh Voices™ that ignite the power of conversation among
companies, their customers, and partners ...  His media expertise and vision
is in alignment with PodTech’s business strategy and extension of our

For their sake, let’s hope that Scoble represents a Cluetrain ticket.</p>

<p>Of stress and lack of sleep, I mean.  Second kids are easier, but when she
refuses to feed and then refuses again and screams tiny screams of hot rage
at your attempts, and won’t stop and won’t eat, and you’re not
getting much sleep, and the house is being renovated, and you’re hoarding
your ration of lucidity, it comes out in the oddest ways.  I drove way too
fast to the supermarket to beat their pharmacy closing time, really
needing a prescription filled; made it with minutes to spare, and when I
walked into 
the mostly-empty store, someone had turned up the music and 
the wild old electric <cite>Layla</cite>
was playing: <i>Let’s make the best
of the situation...</i> (you know the
<a href="http://www.eric-clapton.co.uk/ecla/lyrics/layla.html">rest of that

harder.

I care about the geeks and I don’t care that much about the CIOs, because

will; otherwise not.

<title>Title Pain</title>

<body>
<p>James Holderness, a guy who really knows his shit about syndication tech,
has been doing some torture-testing; see 
<a href="http://www.詹姆斯.com/blog/2006/06/encoding-rss-titles">Encoding RSS
Titles</a>, which shows that if you want to do something as obvious as
mentioning “AT&amp;T” in your title, you’re in deep RSS doo-doo.
(Did I say torture test?  James blogs at 
<a href="http://www.詹姆斯.com">www.詹姆斯.com</a>; the boy’s got attitude.)
Anyhow, James establishes that there’s essentially <em>no safe way</em> to do
this. Quoting him: “Clearly if you want to support Firefox or Internet Explorer
you’ve got no choice but to use the single encoding option. For certain
strings, though, that would mean losing support for at least <em>twenty</em>
other aggregators.”  Yow.
So I emailed James, asking “Would it be oversimplistic to say: ‘Thus, use Atom
1.0?’”  He wrote back “Somewhat. While Atom doesn't have the ambiguities of
the RSS spec, it has all the same problems with buggy clients.”  
Fair enough.  But I think that James proved that, with RSS, you can’t solve the 
problem <em>even in principle</em>.  With Atom, you can.  Which seems like a
decisive argument, to me.
<i>[Update: Oh hell, James’ Chinese URI broke something in the <span

<p><a href="http://www.luschny.de/math/factorial/FastFactorialFunctions.htm">Peter
Luschny</a> writes in with yet another way to break my supposedly bullet-proof
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/22/Binary">binary search algorithm</a>.
You’re searching an array of whatevers; well suppose that array is
declared:<br/>
<code>Whatever[] w = new Whatever[Integer.MAX_VALUE * 2];</code><br/>
I checked, and Java will compile that happily.  
Binary search fall down go boom.  Sigh.  So, if you think you might
have more than a couple billion elements in your array, you’d be better off
declaring all your indexing variables as <code>long</code>. (Which should be
free on a 64-bit computer, right?)
I’ll go update the binary-search article to add this caution.
<i>[Update: Maybe not.  Greg Thompson and
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/sundararajan">A. Sundararajan</a> both point out
that the Java Language Definition requires array indices to be integers, not
longs.  So I wonder why this compiles?]</i></p>

<a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/06/02/when-the-bough-breaks">When
the bough breaks</a>, wrote at length about switching to Ubuntu.
I’ve been thinking about this a lot recently, and now John Gruber’s written 
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2006/06/and_oranges">And Oranges</a>, a
fine excursus on Mark’s piece.
I’m pondering the switch away myself, too, and maybe sharing my thoughts will
be helpful.

[Update:
<a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/06/16/juggling-oranges">More
from Mark</a>.  I feel sick, physically nauseated, that Apple has hidden
my email—the record of my life—away in a proprietary undocumented format.
I’ve had this happen once before (the culprit was Eudora); fool me twice,
shame on me.  Hear a funny sound?  That’s a camel’s back, breaking.]</i>
</p>
<p>Note: The links to pieces of software in this fragment are not to their
pages, but to my experience with them on the Mac.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Conversation Thus Far</h2>
<p>First of all, I should say that I share every one of Mark’s concerns.  In
particular, it’s bothered me for years that the Apple apps 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/03/14/OSMacApps">aren’t Open Source</a>;
there are all these irritating little misfeatures and 
shortcomings that I’d be willing and maybe able to fix, and there are lots
more like me.  Since the apps are joined at the hip to OS X, there’d be no
real downside to Apple.</p>
<p>The real problem, it seems to me (and I think this bothers Mark more than
he says), is Apple’s
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/03/29/Switch#p-1">paranoid communication
culture</a>:
it is forbidden to say anything except what it’s compulsory to say.
Apple’s exterior is polished, shiny; and entirely opaque.  Personally, I think
their success has been about shipping good products, but I think they believe
it’s a consequence of the tightness of the lip.
I’d rather do business with a company I can talk to.</p>
<p>John Gruber’s essay is very hard to disagree with, but I’d place more
weight than either he or Mark did on the increasing excellence of Ubuntu.  If
you haven’t tried a recent Ubuntu, you really should; the level of polish, and
amount of stuff that “Just Works”, is really remarkable.
Ubuntu won’t always be the polish-and-quality leader among Linux distros, of
course; but for now, it’s set a very high standard.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Non-Problems</h2>
<p>I already use lots of OSS:
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/12/16/Adium">Adium</a> for chat,
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/02/16/Camino">Camino</a> (based on Firefox)
for
browsing,
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/Emacs/">Emacs</a> for editing, and
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/What/Technology/Coding/Java/">NetBeans</a>
for Java.  So there’d be zero
cost in those spaces to switch to Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Quite a bit of the Apple software I use, I could move off with little
trouble.
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/04/21/Routing-Around-Spotlight">Mail.app</a>
is bothering me  
more and more every day with its lousy performance and pitiful search
capabilities, so I think I’d be OK with Thunderbird.  How hard can ripping CDs
and playing MP3s be? I don’t think I’d miss iTunes, and I love music too much
to get locked into the iTMS handcuffs.</p>
<p>I use iCal but 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/05/11/iCal-still-sucks">I hate it</a>; it’s
lost my calendar data, which is intolerable.
I’m only still there because I
haven’t had the time to invest in finding an alternative.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Painful But Bearable</h2>
<p>I <em>know</em> I’d miss
Preview, it’s the unsung Apple software hero.  The thought of having to go
back to using Acrobat makes me want to puke.  
iMovie, that’s another problem.  
<i>[Update: Evince is said to be an excellent Preview replacement.]</i>
If I
want to keep shooting
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/Video/">HD video</a>, and I do, maybe a 
dedicated Mac Mini video-editing
station is the thing, because doing it on a laptop is a dumb idea
anyhow.</p>
<p>On the non-Apple front,
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/13/PhotoShopElements3">PhotoShop Elements</a> meets my needs pretty well, but
I’m pretty sure I could learn to live with, if not love, the Gimp.
<i>[Update: Mark Pilgrim says Krita is good too.]</i></p>
<p>Finally, there’d be a certain amount of visual pain, because a lot of Linux
applications think things like anti-aliasing, drop shadows, and transparency
are optional extras, not things that are just expected to be there.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>The Hard Issues</h2>
<p>There are three things the Macs do that I don’t think I could live
without:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Quick suspend/resume; the feature that originally drove me
to 
switch, back in 2002.  When I open my laptop and put my hands on the keyboard
I want to be able to start typing <em>right then</em>.
<i>[Update: Several Ubuntuns write to tell me that the delay is down into the
15-20 second range (but can be screwed up by the wrong hardware).]</i></p></li>
<li><p>WiFi that Just Works.  It so often happens; I’m in a meeting, I open my
laptop and I’m on the air, while the Windows victims are saying “Are you
<em>sure</em> there’s WiFi in here?  What are the hex digits?” and the Linux
types are reconfiguring their kernels.
<i>[Update: Ubuntuns report that this is getting there, but the answers
contain disturbing mentions of “this great utility” and “a little
tinkering”.]</i></p></li>
<li><p>Outboard projector.  I have a public-facing job.  When I plug my
computer into a projector, I want it to project, without me having to think
about it.
I’ve never seen a Linux or Solaris box do this reliably.
<i>[Update: Feedback confirms this is still a real issue in Linux-land.]</i></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-5'>Will I Switch?</h2>
<p>Yes.  For Mark’s reasons, and because I’m pretty darn sure that either
Ubuntu or some other distro will eventually get the key things right.</p>
<p>Alternatively, Apple could open-source a few of their apps so we could all
fix the pain points, and they could start having an actual conversation with
the world.
Nothing less is acceptable.</p>
<p>As John Gruber points out, neither Mark nor I are exactly typical.
But you know what?  I think that if the GNU/Linux/Solaris community can
sustain its current level of energy and progress, and if Apple 
maintains its dysfunctional communications culture, there are going to be
better choices just not for me, but for a lot of other people too.</p>

<title>Why SavaJe?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/06/02/Savaje-Gripe">wrote about</a> my rather
mixed initial experience of the
<a href="http://www.savaje.com/show_device.html">SavaJe Jasper S20</a>.
I’m making progress, and
I’m going to invest a bit more work in this device, because I think it’s
important.  In this fragment I explain why I think so, with a bit
more hands-on narrative.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Narrative</h2>
<p>My flame back in early June caused a bit of a stir; it turns out that
SavaJe is one of our partners, and certain Sun execs got heated input from
certain SavaJe execs along the lines of “Who is Bray and why does he hate
us?”</p>
<p>I would have been unimpressed, except for as I’d already reported, they’d
already become very responsive on the developer
forums.  We’ve been working together to get this thing on my funky Canadian
GPRS network and
deal with my other issues.  The ball’s in my court, and I’ve been held up
because I need a Windows box to program the little goober and I’ve been
bringing Lauren’s last-but-one Thinkpad back up to date, and there’ve been
interruptions.  It turns out that the Windows-only limitation isn’t a SavaJe
thing, it’s buried somewhere in the whole mobile-technology stack; I don’t
understand it yet, but I’ll figure it out.</p>
<p>In the interim, I’ve got the Bluetooth working great with my Mac, and I can
move pictures and movies back and forth.  And I’ve got the USB connection from
the 
Thinkpad working, and NetBeans all ready to go; so we’re really close.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Why?</h2>
<p>The idea of a “Java phone” is not exactly new, the world has 
millions of ’em today, and I’m told that teenagers waste huge amounts of time
playing games.
But they’ve got two big problems.  First, the Java in
question is an fairly-small subset, so that ordinary non-specialist Java
developers find it irritating to work with.  Also, there are compatibility
problems to a greater degree than we’re used to with Java.
All these things are irritating, but bearable.</p>
<p>Here’s what’s really broken: what makes a phone interesting is that it’s,
you know, a phone, and by and large, the phone part isn’t accessible to the
Java running on the phone.
Typically, these things have a runtime engine written in C (if you’re lucky)
that takes care of telephony and audio and the low-level stuff, and there’s
little compatibility from handset maker to handset maker, or even from one
model to the next from the same maker.</p>
<p>SavaJe is about fixing that.  The idea is that more or less everything the
phone can do is Java-programmable, and furthermore, it’s (almost) a full Java
SE (JSR209 to be precise).</p>
<p>This tickles my fancy.  Off the top of my head, here are the things I
can imagine building:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Regularly fetch an Atom feed of a stock price, and when it sees an
entry that matches 
some particular pattern, telephone me and play a sound file.</p></li>
<li><p>Push the missed-calls list to the Web as a feed.</p></li>
<li><p>I notice that there doesn’t seem to be a pre-cooked sync between the
phone and OS X. Who cares?   I can get my Mac to export vCard, and Google
suggests there’s lots of vCard parsing software in Java, and I should be able
to pull the data from either the Mac with Bluetooth or from the web if
necessary, and look up phone numbers, and maybe even make calls.</p></li>
<li><p>Same thing with iCal data... I’m already publishing an
<code>.ics</code> file, why can’t my phone tell me what I’m doing
today?  Or talk to the phone’s built-in alarm program to ring a bell when I’m
supposed to make a call?</p></li>
<li><p>Jython.  JRuby.  <i>[cackles demonically...]</i></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Probably some of those won’t work, for reasons I’ll discover once I
dive in.  But the notion of having a phone that any Java geek can program 
to do whatever—if it actually happens—isn’t just a game-changer, it’s a
world-changer.  So I’m gonna nominate myself as a typical
non-mobile-specialist Java geek and see what I can make this puppy do.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>The Competition</h2>
<p>The vibe I get from my mobile-savvy friends is that a lot of people think
Linux+Java is the mobile platform of the future.  For example, check the
noise that Motorola’s making over at
<a href="http://developer.motorola.com/?path=1.2">MOTODEV</a>. 
(Is the the successor to what used to be called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JUIX">JUIX</a>?)
Sounds plausible, but not as developer-friendly as what SavaJe is trying to
do, if they can make it work.</p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>

<title>2006 World Cup</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’ve been working quite a bit this week, only managed to catch a couple of
games end-to-end live, and some bits and pieces in the evening repeats; I have
to say, watching the Cup in high-def on a comfy 
couch with a comfy newborn on your lap is pretty darn enjoyable.
Herewith the week’s notes, starting where the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/06/11/World-Cup">previous instalment</a> left
off.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>In General</h2>
<p><i>Item:</i> Can we drop the “FIFA” already?  It’s
been the damn World Cup since I was a kid.
<i>Item:</i> Do soccer referees get selected on the basis of having standard
facial expressions?  The schoolmarm scowl achieves near-perfect uniformity
whether it’s a Colombian referee berating a Dutch striker or a Korean referee
an Angolan keeper.  Perhaps the players find it comforting.
<i>Item:</i> One thing that drives me nuts is the way the advertisers pound
the same ads at us over and over; there are some that, by the end of the Cup,
will have me leaving the room the microsecond they start.  Having said that,
the Adidas “Jose +10” series, with the Latino urchins picking all the big
stars for their 
courtyard game, is amusing and touching and stays fresh, I find.
<i>Item:</i> If you want a Web site that summarizes the
<a href="http://soccer.sportsnet.tsn.ca/schedule_results/">schedule, games</a>
and
<a href="http://soccer.sportsnet.tsn.ca/group_standings/">standings</a> compactly with a minimum of Flash and trash,
<a href="http://soccer.sportsnet.tsn.ca/">TSN.ca</a> is pretty good.</p>
<p>On to the games.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Australia 3 Japan 1</h2>
<p>The Aussies are a likable team and it would be fun if they could put a
scare into Brazil, but I’m not betting on it.  Japan can play better, and I
hope they will.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>US 0 Czech Republic 3</h2>
<p>The Yanks weren’t <em>that</em> bad; I thought the Czechs were that good.
They could go far; it warms my
heart to see Nedved in form.  Czech-Italy should be a humdinger.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Italy 2 Ghana 0</h2>
<p>The Fox Sports World channel I watch late-night soccer on shows a lot of
<i>Serie A</i>, so I’ve watched a lot of the <i>Azzuri</i> play.  They are
one of two or three sides that, if they stay on form and get a little luck,
can <em>clearly</em> win the World Cup.  Totti, when he’s on his game, is
maybe my favorite soccer player, and if he strengthens over the month he could
break the hearts of a few other countries’ fans.</p>
<p>Having said that, I enjoyed the Ghana game as much as any I’ve seen; the
Ghanaians’ slashing attack was really a delight to watch. it’s a pity they’re 
in there with the Italians and Czechs; I’d love to see them scaring the pants
off one of the favorites in the second round.
Also, this match was a visual treat; the Italians in blue and olive
(skin), the Ghanaians in white and black (skin).</p>
<p>Don’t miss the Czech-Ghana game on Saturday.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Korea 2 Togo 1, France 0 Switzerland 0</h2>
<p>Korea, who bring actual joy and excitement to the game, are so obviously the
class of this group.  I’d be happiest if Togo were the other team to advance
because that passionless, attackless, half-speed France-Switzerland affair was
a blot on the face of the game.  Probably France will limp into the second
round, but I can’t see them lasting long.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>England 2 Trinidad &amp; Tobago 0</h2>
<p>England might manage to take one or two steps down the road, but I really
hope not.  Late in the T&amp;T match, Crouch, whose can get a header any
time because he’s eight feet tall, but whose headers had been missing by yards
either side of the goal, got one on target.  So then England checked out,
defending their 1-0 lead, lazy triangle passes in open space.  Exactly as they
did against Costa Rica.  What
contemptible behavior; have they no respect for their own profession?  
And I’d actually started liking England a little bit when Rooney brought some
second-half life to the affair.
The Gerrard goal was perfectly fine but I booed it, and unless they actually
wake up and play like men I’ll be cheering for whichever team eventually knocks
them out.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>Netherlands 2 Côte d'Ivoire 1</h2>
<p>The Ivorians are an appealing bunch, and totally have the best hair in the
World Cup.
I wish there were one of the big-name favorites that I could like as much as I
like all these scrappy attacking African teams.
And you know, they could and maybe should have won this one.  
There was a totally obvious Dutch foul deep in the penalty area in the early
going that went uncalled.
Having said that, the referee in that game is totally OK by me for having
booked Robben on an egregious, blatant, dive.  Robben is a wonderful player,
an obvious choice if you were putting together an Earth team to take on
the Alpha Centauri All-Stars; so why does he do things like that?</p>
<p>Further: Kone’s goal was maybe the best individual effort by anyone, any
team, in the tournament so far.
But you know, having said all that, I’m not sure I’d bet against Holland in
this tournament, whatever the opposition.</p>

<title>Unicode Blues</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>In the past few days I’ve been watching two debates on the subject of
Unicode; one on the
<a href="http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf/current/index.html">main
IETF general-discussion list</a>, and another on
<a href="http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/ruby/ruby-talk/index.shtml">ruby-talk</a> 
(there <em>must</em> be a better archive).  In IETF-land, the elders are
once again convincing each other that Internet Standards need not be written
in a way that allows characters other than ASCII; thus, for example, you can’t
correctly record the names of contributors like Bill de hÓra or Martin Dürst;
nor can you illustrate any discussions of network protocols which carry
payloads other than those which can be expressed in primitively-typeset
English.  I have a lot of the respect for the IETF’s achievements,
but I think my revulsion at this institutional bigotry
will probably soon drive me out of the organization.
In Ruby-land, it seems that Matz
<a href="http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/197938">has
spoken</a>, and Ruby, the next generation, will have a wonderful String class
that deals with everything; handling Unicode, which they see as unacceptably
limited, as merely one case among many.
This thinking seems deeply broken to me but I am only shallowly immersed in
Ruby and don’t understand the
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=han%20unification">Han Unification</a>
angst that is at the root of things.
I don’t have much influence in either community (which is
appropriate, I haven’t earned it). I’ll raise my voice for, what that’s worth,
to argue that getting Unicode really right is a <em>necessary</em> condition
for being a technology provider in the third millennium, and may prove to be
<em>sufficient</em>, insofar as internationalized-text issues go.
I’m not optimistic that this will make any difference.
But if either community decides to give Unicode a serious
go, I’ll volunteer to pitch in, to work to make it work.</p>

<title>2006 World Cup, and More</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I watched two complete games and parts of another two, this
weekend, and... played in one!  Fathers’ Day, you betcha.</p>
<p>The big take-away from this weekend?  Group E Oh My Goodness.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Czechs 0 Ghana 2</h2>
<p>I am officially a major fan of Ghana’s “Black Stars”, as of now.
Chances are they advance, and I will be rooting for them against whichever
big-name side they play next.</p>
<p>Here’s why: Call me old-fashioned, but I see soccer as a game of movement,
and I’ve always thought that running really fast into open space in the
direction of the opponent’s goal, with or without the ball, is one of the ways
the game ought to be played.  The Ghanaians do this well and all the time,  
but the technique is no longer practiced in
European soccer, where attack relies on a bunch of boring passes outside
the zone, followed by a long ball to someone on the wing who might
manage to get a cross in front.  Or, occasionally, a pass slipped
into the top of the box where the attacker’ll look for a turn or back-heel
or whatever, but usually either loses the ball or passes it back to centre.
Bah.</p>
<p>Just because the Ghanaians have (apparently) more pace than anyone else
doesn’t mean they can’t do an architected build-up; Muntari’s goal
was the climax of a subtle, artful, and razor-edged passing sequence; the best
such that I’ve seen in the Cup so far.</p>
<p>And you don’t hear much about their defense, but do please observe that
in 180 minutes of football against Italy and the Czechs they’ve
allowed two goals; so they must be doing something right.</p>
<p>Both of Saturday’s scorers fouled out for the US match, which has to be a
complete wild-card based on the Group E action so far.  I’d have said the
Americans were likely to be run over by the Black Stars’ firewagon, but they
played very damn tight soccer against Italy and that’ll be a nail-biter.
Obviously, at this point, every goal in every Group-E match is a matter of
life or death.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Brazil 2 Australia 0</h2>
<p>I am so waiting to see the Brazilians really tested.  They played well, but
they didn’t win; the Aussies lost.  There were by my count four different
opportunities where a Socceroo was looking at an empty goal-mouth or went
one-on-one with the keeper, and came away blank.  It’s pretty simple: when
you’re playing against a good team like Brazil and you don’t capitalize on
their mistakes, you lose, that’s all.</p>
<p>But still, you have to love that rocking-the-baby Brazilian
goal celebration.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>France 1 South Korea 1</h2>
<p>France seemed the better team, but that counts for exactly zero on the
score-sheet, and it’s hard to shed too many tears; first because the Koreans
are lovable, second because keeper Lee Woon-Jae is the real deal, and third
because French football is boring.</p>
<p>My guess is that South Korea will slaughter Switzerland and France will
struggle for a win against Togo but still get into the second round on a
tie-break, more’s the pity.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Dads 0 Kids 3</h2>
<p>We went down to the park Sunday afternoon and a general soccer frenzy broke
out; kids (I think there were seven of them) against three Dads and an
11-year-old who didn’t want to play with “the kids”.  They were leading
slightly when suppertime approached so we reset the score and played to three
and they won fair and square, we were really trying; well, except for you don’t
really take your best shot on goal against someone who’s three feet tall.
My own almost-seven-year-old notched the winner, a clean hard high left-footed
drive.  Facetiousness is a grown-up thing; after he scored I said “no dessert
for you” but dessert is serious business at that age
and he got genuinely upset and I had to explain that it was a joke, and then
apologize.</p>
<p>But did we ever have fun; more than Ronaldinho and Muntari and Woon-Jae put
together, I bet.</p>

<title>Open-Sourcing Apple Apps</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>John Gruber, in
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2006/06/apple_open_source">Why Apple Won’t
Open Source Its Apps</a>, responds at length to my
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/06/15/Switch-From-Mac">Time 
to Switch</a> piece, but really mostly to a 2004 piece, 
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/03/14/OSMacApps">Apple
Should Go Open Source</a>.
I always enjoy and usually agree with John’s writing (for example, his
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2006/06/drm_interoperability">piece today
on DRM</a>); but I think he’s nearly 100% wrong about how Open Source and
business fit together.</p>
<p>John agrees that open-sourcing the app suite (iCal, Mail.app, iChat, and so
on) would be a net benefit to the community, but suggests that Apple won’t, for
business reasons; that this would impair their ability to sell a new OS
release to a few million people every couple of years for a couple of hundred
bucks.</p>
<p>I just don’t see it.  If there were an enhanced guerrilla version of, for
example, Mail.app, that did message-selection correctly and had a next-unread
button, both these fixes being provided by a community member, some things
would happen.  First, I’d use it.  Second, the vast majority of Mac users
wouldn’t.   Third, when the Leopard release of Mail.app, presumably with new
goodies, came out, it would be back-ported to Tiger.  Fourth, I and most of
the other people using the variant Mail.app would upgrade to Leopard
anyhow.</p>
<p>Why would we upgrade?  One reason is that the “big cat” releases all contain
OS-level as well as app-level enhancements; and often these are the
interesting ones.   Second, and more important, by paying Apple a hundred
bucks or so a year, on average, I’m buying peace of mind; every week or two I
hit “Software Update” and sleep a little sounder knowing that all my bits and
pieces are as up-to-date and secure as Apple knows how to make
them.</p>
<p>If Apple were like Sun, and selling to companies rather than individuals,
it would make more sense to just sign a $100/year maintenance contract; which
is more or less exactly our business model for Solaris.
But for consumer products, Apple’s
much-ballyhooed new OS releases produce essentially the same result, plus
they’re a useful marketing vehicle.</p>
<p>The real lesson: Open Source isn’t anti-business and it shouldn’t even
impact your software revenue.  As Eric Raymond wrote in
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/magic-cauldron/">The Magic
Cauldron</a> (this was before he
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/10/03/ESR-Has-Cracked-Up">cracked up</a>):
“software is largely a service industry operating under the persistent but
unfounded delusion that it is a manufacturing industry.”</p>
<p>And remember, if Apple gets the licensing right, they’d be free to grab the
good hacks &amp; patches that the community comes up with, and this would help
them keep up in the UI race with Windows on one hand and GNU/Linux on the
other.  They’re gonna need all the help they can get.</p>

<title>Friday Coding Hint</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’m sure you know the feeling; an innocent-seeming refactoring causes
little waves of disturbance all over your
system and all of a sudden lots of your tests are failing, and you can’t seem
to to really get a handle on it.  So yesterday after a couple of hours of
hard slogging with no net gain, I threw up my hands in disgust and mowed the
lawn.  Halfway through it, I realized the refactoring was subtly wrong at the
core, and when I came back in I made one little shift and was able to delete
lots of special-case code and the tests passed.  Problem is, I hate mowing the
lawn. </p>

<title>How We Learn</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Here’s the bald truth: the state of the art in Information Technology is
being advanced, first, in releases of open-source technology (which speak
louder than words) and, insofar as words go, primarily in online site-to-site
conversations.  You can watch it happen.  Michi Henning hauled our body of
knowledge one small but important step up the endless mountainside with his
<a href="http://acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=396">The
Rise and Fall of CORBA</a>, in the always-excellent
<a href="http://acmqueue.com/">ACM Queue</a>.  Bruce Eckel, in
<a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=165293">Are Web
Services Real? Part II</a>, focuses on the obvious process parallels
between CORBA and WS-* (reliable laugh line: “WS-* is becoming CORBA, only
with angle brackets to make it slower”).  Finally, Steve Loughran’s
<a href="http://www.1060.org/blogxter/entry?publicid=5BAD07A658944AE07F694E5FEAFC64F0">On Corba, DCOM, ICE, and distributed objects in general</a>
really goes deep, wondering whether distributed objects are an inherently
broken idea.  His closing words: “REST handles it best by freezing the set of verbs to a low number, only allowing one way links, but at a price, the price of no easy mapping between REST resources and native classes, no two-way links and (currently) not very easy APIs. The question is, when will the Enterpriseys notice that this is the only thing that has been shown to work.”
I don’t think the “Enterprisey” epithet has been a very useful addition
to our discourse; but aside from that, well, <em>yeah</em>.</p>

<title>Not Writing Much</title>

<p>I haven’t been, recently, although the “needs writing about” queue never
stops growing.  I’ve got a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/06/11/Now-We-Are-Four">new daughter</a>,
who takes bandwidth.  After I told the world about my Sigrid project at Java
One, two different groups want to try it out, but I decided it needed
one last refactoring, which takes bandwidth.
Most of all though, that Ruby-community discussion around Unicode
turned into a mind-bomb for me.  I’ve been programming in dynamic languages
for many years, and thinking about i18n and Unicode for almost as long, but it
had never occurred to me to think about what The Right Way is to combine
them.  Now I’m having trouble thinking about anything else.
I’m not ready to write; among other things, there are people in the Ruby
community who see certain things as axiomatic that I see as simply wrong and
unsupported by any evidence.  I don’t think they’re stupid so I need to do
more listening.
Oh, all these things taking bandwidth, they’re good things; this is a good
time, and summer’s here!  I hope you’re enjoying life too.</p>

<p>Wow,

have worked on so hard for so long.  Still, I remember being told in the early
Nineties, when I was talking up Unix servers, that I was silly and wrong
because the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo_%28operating_system%29">Cairo</a>
object filesystem would make everything else irrelevant.  And then years later,
when I was selling search and content management for a living, being told once
again that we’d all be casualties of the WinFS bandwagon.
I wonder if, in other professions as in ours, the conventional wisdom is so
often so wrong?

<title>2006 World Cup</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I enjoy sports on TV, but not enough (usually) to plan ahead on watching
them; but we’ve been making an exception for the World Cup.  This weekend, I
stuck my head in the boy’s room both days and said “eight o’clock” and we
watched the quarter-finals together while the girls slept upstairs.
<i>[Oops, I wrote this last weekend but apparently never posted it.]</i></p>
<p>The game of soccer doesn’t have the nail-grinding tension of the late
innings in a baseball game that really matters, and it doesn’t have the
full-impact testosterone rush of football or hockey, and it doesn’t have the
highlight-a-minute scoring avalanche of basketball.
But it’s got emotion and improvisation and physical intelligence a-plenty.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it also has really bad, pro-wrestling level histrionics.
Paul Romanuk nails it in 
<a href="http://soccer.sportsnet.tsn.ca/news_story/?ID=223">Down about
diving</a>.  The stretchers should come equipped with apparatus for
administering a powerful electric shock to malingerers, to be given based on a
secret signal from the referee to to the bearers.  This would be powerful
incentive to those merely faking it to hop to their feet, to be greeted by an
automatic yellow card.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Tail End of the Round Robin</h2>
<p>I was working pretty hard this week and only caught a couple of games, plus
highlight-reel bits and pieces.  
<i>Item:</i> Sorry, America.  Ghana is a better team this time
around.  Learn to score. <i>Item:</i> It’s a pity France made it out of the
first round. <i>Item:</i> Switzerland might be for real.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Germany 2 Sweden 0</h2>
<p>If you absolutely must play boring static European big-country soccer, you
ought to play it the way the Germans do, with some genuinely creative
forwards (well, they’re transplanted Poles, but let’s not quibble).
Still, that formation passing and midfield ball movement are impressive to
watch (if not actually entertaining).  I understand the bookies still have
Brazil and Argentina favored over Germany.  That’s crazy.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Argentina 2 Mexico 1</h2>
<p>Wow, what a wonderful game; in particular the first half and the overtime;
both sides let up a little in the second half.
Either 
could have won, but nobody could call the result an injustice.  Still (see
previous section) I suspect the Argentines don’t get past Germany.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>England 1 Ecuador 0, Portugal 1 Netherlands 0</h2>
<p>Bah humbug.  Feh.  Two goals (total) in two games.  England (as usual) did
the minimum necessary.  Portugal hacked and dived.  Holland likewise, only
with more diving.  Have these people no self-respect?  So it’ll be the
hackers against the slackers, the time-wasters against the leg-choppers.  God
help the referee.  At least Maniche’s goal showed a flash of brilliance
against the dark backdrop of unsportsmanlike infamy.</p>
<p>On the other half of that half: Brazil, Ghana, Spain, and
France.  I suppose Spain chews up and spits out France, while Brazil
tragically ends the beautiful Ghanaian run.  That quarter’s winner will make
short work of either the hackers or the slackers.</p>

<title>Dabble DB, Check It Out</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Paul Kedrosky
<a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2006/06/26/dabble_db_news.html">broke
the story</a>: Vancouver’s own <a href="http://dabbledb.com/">Dabble DB</a>
has taken some investment money and are 
<a href="http://dabbledb.com/pricing/">open for business</a>.
I get pitched by a <em>lot</em> of startups, and  Dabble DB is the best
I’ve seen in years.  It’s Software as a Service; an
online personal database.  
Millions of of people in businesses large and small around the world do this
kind of thing via Excel kludges, sometimes with some Access and Outlook in the
mix.
Only Dabble doesn’t need any software on the desktop and still has a better
user interface than anything Microsoft ships.  In fact, one smart person told
me it didn’t matter that much what Dabble <em>did</em>, because 
its authors Avi Bryant and Andrew Catton are such great UI designers they
could make a 
cemetery scheduler interesting.  But it does matter, because
Dabble is in that magic category where it does something that you realize you
need after you’ve tried it, and there’s nothing else that does it.
Go check it out; but if you like it, you’ll have to pay (not much) to use it;
what a concept!
<i>Disclosure:</i>  Avi and Andrew and I have bought each other lots of
lunches.  I advised them, repeatedly, not to take VC money, arguing that
there’s a deep disconnect between venture investing as it’s currently done,
and the realities of Web-based businesses.
Paul Kedrosky and Ventures West are making a determined attempt to prove me
wrong; I can’t talk about the details but I’m really impressed at the
creativity they’ve brought to the table.  I couldn’t in good conscience advise
the guys to pass on the deal; but I did ask if I could take a piece of it.</p>

<p>It’s like this: John is the guy who’s building the new room for the new
kid; he was recommended by Diane, who’s a friend who used to work with Lauren
and got me to do the XBRL keynote and lives ten blocks west, near the Pilates
studio where we work out and Lauren swaps computer maintenance for private
consultations, and it turns out that John’s stepson Joe was in our kid’s
kindergarten class and we already knew him; Joe and John and Rudy live just
down the street from Brennan, who was also in the kindergarten class and whose
mom gives our kid piano lessons.
We got in Albin to do the
electrical work, he’s worked on the house before and knows the ropes; I met
Albin through my old friend Glen, I rent an office
from Glen over a clothing boutique he runs as a sideline, he uses my pictures
on the covers of his neutraceuticals-company catalog  and he brought Albin
in to run the wires for the DSL at the store/office.  Matt, who used to work
for me and Glen at a
former business we were in, set up the DSL at the store, and he helps us do the
firewalls on the Debian box in our basement, and he also hosts
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> on a server he runs for his political party,
and he just wrote me asking to pitch in against some DMCA-like legislation
looming foully over the Canadian horizon, and I helped Sun sell some Ultras to
the lab where Matt works at a local university, and then helped straighten
things up when 
manufacturing screwed up and sent the wrong CD with the computers.  Turns out
John is going to be doing some work for Tracy three doors down, whose boy and
ours play all the time and sleep over and so on; but Tracy met John not
through us but via Nick’s mom; Nick was also in that kindergarten class and
played soccer with our kid on the team that I co-coached with Phil, who does
secret stuff for Apple and used to do the XML conference proceedings for
Lauren and sits on the ECMA committee trying to put 
lipstick on the Microsoft Office XML pig.
Anyhow, John and
Albin hit it off and they’ll probably call each other in for carpentry and
electrical work in future.
Why do we need computers to help us with this?</p>

<title>Atom Newsreel</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I work on lots of different things, but Atom is the most important, don’t
you forget it.  <i>Item:</i> Atom 1.0 isn’t even a year old and it
already has its first standardized extension, for feed threading; 
announcement
<a href="http://www.snellspace.com/wp/?p=371">chez James
Snell</a>, who did most of the work.
<i>Item:</i> Bloglines has resumed work on their Atom 1.0 parser, and it’s
considerably less broken than it used to be.  You can actually use it to read 
<a href="/ongoing/ongoing.atom">my Atom feed</a> and it no longer messes up
the white space.  The relative-link handling still needs work, though; my
pictures don’t show up, and some internal links are broken (not
all... puzzling).  Anyhow, good on ya guys, this is the right direction.
<i>Item:</i> The working group just published Draft 9 of the protocol 
(<a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-atompub-protocol-09.txt">official</a>
and
<a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/">HTML</a> versions).
My opinion is that nothing in here will change much, and there will be a couple

<title>Apple Hates Grandmothers</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Actually, I’m being unfair.  Maybe it’s just the QuickTime team 
who hates them.
Alternatively, it’s plausibly someone in the Windows team at Microsoft.  Just
possibly it’s someone at Sony.
And in fact this fragment is only vaguely about grandmothers, it’s about the
failures of consumer 
video technology.  But it <em>is</em> the
grandmothers who are being hurt.</p>
<p>What happened was, I took lots of high-def video of my adorable soft pink 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/06/11/Now-We-Are-Four">new daughter</a> with
my adorable hard black
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/05/08/Video">new Sony</a>.
Then I used iMovie HD to make a 4'38" assemblage of heart-grabbing scenes: her
brother meets her for the first time, she has her first bath, she squirms
angelically in a rumple of baby bedding, Lauren and a friend rock two 
newborns side-by-side in the porch swing, outro of sleeping cherub in
swaying bassinet in the dappled dusk.</p>
<p>I dunno about iMovie, on the one hand it makes me feel like an idiot, but on
the other hand, when it comes to video, I am.  One thing
though; a 1.67GHz PowerBook just doesn’t have the raw horsepower, HD video eats
gigabytes for breakfast and wants a second breakfast.  Nonetheless, I wrestled
it to the ground and while my attempts to pay homage to 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Tarkovsky">Tarkovsky</a> may not
have entirely succeeded, it’s got
lots of ravishing high-definition pink baby flesh.</p>
<p>So I thought her grandmothers might like to see this (we
couldn’t invite them down because we foolishly scheduled home renovations in
parallel with the arrival).
The trouble is, one of the grandmothers has a Windows box and a dial-up
connection.</p>
<p>You may recall that earlier, I worked out
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/05/11/HD-High-Def-to-Quicktime">a process</a>
for turning 1080i high-def video into QuickTime files that almost anyone can
use.  Unfortunately, I couldn’t combine this with modern H.264 compression to
achieve sane file sizes.</p>
<p>Recently, I got a note from
<a href="http://infa.fi/~jhagman/">Jussi Hagman</a>, who wondered why I just
didn’t use QuickTime’s H.264 compressor to make my movies smaller.  “Because
it doesn’t de-interlace” I thought, but then I noticed that
actually, it does, there’s a well-hidden button on the screen-size-selector
screen. (Why there?  And why doesn’t the stupid fucking thing just notice that
the stupid fucking signal is interlaced and <em>just fucking fix it</em>?)</p>
<p>So I dropped all the intermediate steps and told iMovie’s Export dialog
(oops, it doesn’t have an Export dialog, it’s called “Share”, awww, isn’t
that so much <em>warmer</em>?), which is actually just QuickTime, to use H.264
and de-interlace and squeeze the sound at a level appropriate for anything
less than audiophile-quality music.  
Bonus: It runs as fast as molasses, which is way better than the glacier-like pace of
my previous approach, and my Java One movies came out at like 5M instead of
100M apiece.  Thanks, Jussi!</p>
<p>So, the baby movie at 400x225 made a 48M file, which is still not
dialup-friendly, but hey, I can drop a CD in the mail, right?</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Windows + QuickTime Hates Grandmothers</h2>
<p>I can view that baby movie in QuickTime or VLC on the Mac, and
<em>sometimes</em> in QuickTime 7.1 on Windows.
I tried it on Lauren’s current Toshiba laptop under XP (no), a 2002-vintage
Athlon Win2K white-box (yes), a 2004-vintage Thinkpad running XP (yes), and a
2005-vintage Athlon WinXP white-box (no).  Spot the pattern?  Me
neither.</p>
<img src="PLF.png" alt="Penguin Liberation Front" />
<div class="caption"><p>Great logo, or what?</p></div>
<p>I don’t have any Linux or Solaris boxes with actual screens attached around
the house, so I asked
<a href="http://diveintomark.org/">Mark Pilgrim</a> if he’d point his spankin’ new Ubuntu box at the
video and tell me what he saw.  Strangely, his comments failed to note my
homage to Tarkovsky.  He discussed illegal codecs from the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin_Liberation_Front">Penguin
Liberation Front</a>, sucking donkey balls, and gouging my eyes out with sharp
objects.  Bottom line:
<a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/">mplayer</a> is good, otherwise if you’re a
Linux-lovin’ grandma who wants to savor that glow of baby flesh, you need to
join the Penguin Liberators.</p>
<p>You know, in the interest of making grandmothers happy I’m OK with forgoing
free file formats, I just want QuickTime on the Mac to write files that
QuickTime on Windows can read.  But someone out there hates grandmothers too
much.</p>

<title>Raccoontongue</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>In the neighbors’ back yard there’s an immense cherry tree; someone told me
it was a leftover from the orchard that was here before the houses were built,
but ours was built in 1919 and it’s hard to believe the tree’s <em>that</em>
old.  Anyhow, the cherries—as is common with old fruit trees—are probably not
that tasty any more, but we don’t know because they’re way up there and hard to
come at, and the wildlife get them first.
This evening in the late sun there were two raccoons having
cherries for dinner, and I got a couple of pictures.</p>
<p>First, bit of scale.  All of these are with the Tamron SP at full
210-mm extension and I should have taken one showing the whole tree—the
raccoon would have looked like an ant.  They’re actually the size of a
medium-small dog.</p>
<img src="IMGP3639.jpg" alt="Raccoon in cherry tree" />
<p>And unless you’ve got an extra-large or extra-mean dog, you don’t want
yours getting mixed up with one.  When I was 18 and stupid, I owned a
huge, fierce, un-neutered tomcat that attacked anything that moved; it
met a raccoon once and cost me hundreds of dollars that I didn’t
really have to get it put back together.</p>
<p>Aside from that, there’s really no harm in them.  Here’s a closer view;
you can see the cherries that led him or her up the tree.</p>
<img src="IMGP3644.jpg" alt="Raccoon in cherry tree" />
<p>Finally, here’s a profile shot, again with cherries, and also with a rare
view of a raccoon tongue in the wild.</p>

<title>World Cup, the Quarterfinals</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I managed to watch most of all four games, and boy, were
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/06/26/World-Cup">my predictions</a> ever
wrong.
The quarterfinals produced few creative triumphs, but were
still pretty entertaining.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Pre-Quarterfinals</h2>
<p>First off, I take back all the nasty things I said about France.  To my
astonishment, they suddenly switched from boring to interesting and jaded to
passionate. Sorry, Spain.
And, to the Aussies: my condolences, the ref could have avoided calling that
penalty and nobody would have been shocked.  Still, your game is just too
light on strikers and finishing; juice up that dimension and you could be in
the final in my lifetime.
And bye-bye Ghana <i>[sob]</i>, one of these years a running attacking joyous
African football team will manage to take it up one more notch and just go
through the World Cup like a hot knife through butter, leaving the Eurobots
wondering what hit them.</p>
<p>On to the quarters.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Germany 1 Argentina 1</h2>
<p>Fair outcome, and both sides had so tight a grip that it wasn’t much fun to
watch.  You have to be impressed, though, with Ballack, who could barely
stand, taking his penalty-shot turn with power and cool.
If I had to bet on a winner, I’d probably bet on Germany.  Not a sure thing,
obviously; 
I think any of other three teams left standing might manage to get past
them, but they better do it in the first two hours because I can’t see
anyone beating Germany at penalties.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Italy 3 Ukraine 0</h2>
<p>Ukraine, to be fair, had taken a pretty soft path to the quarters and
maybe didn’t deserve to be there.  But Italy is looking better and better
and totally won it fair and square.  Sure, give Ukraine the two goals that
bounced off wood and it looks closer; but the Italians, given the chance, hit
the net not the wood.</p>
<p>Could the Italians win it all?  Absolutely; if their defense plays at its
soul-deadening best, and if Buffon maintains his awesome form; it just takes
two opponents to make one mistake each and provoke that lethal
<i>Azzurri</i> pounce.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>England 0 Portugal 0</h2>
<p>After the Portugal-Netherlands debacle, I’d dismissed the Portuguese as a
bunch of cheating, diving, hacking goons, and thus was cheering on the English
who play, relatively speaking, an honest if only partially committed game.</p>
<p>Only the Portuguese stayed pretty clean, and the English were unable to
overcome the combination of rather stinky officiating and their
own stupidity; if your Great Scoring Hope can’t avoid getting sent off in that
kind of situation, you’re toast.</p>
<p>I can’t see the Portuguese getting past France into the final.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Brazil 0 France 1</h2>
<p>Like I said above, I take back all my unkind remarks about the French.  All
of a sudden they’re playing an exciting, dynamic, disciplined game, and—wonder
of wonders—Zidane has, apparently by pure force of will, made himself once
again the world’s most dominating player.  Those in Real Madrid management may
be forgiven their fury at an underperforming
<i>galáctico</i> suddenly becoming the real thing given the right stimulus,
which apparently isn’t Spanish paychecks.</p>
<p>Everyone kept wondering when the Brazilians were going to play up to their
reputation and the answer turned out to be “never”.  Earth to remaining World
Cup contestants: when Zidane has the ball, don’t do like Brazil and leave
Henry unmarked at the post.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Going Forward</h2>
<p>Who knows?  It’s a pity it’s all Europe.  I think betting against Portugal
would be pretty safe at this point, but any one of Buffon or Totti or Adriano or
Klose or Lehmann or Ballack or Zidane or Henry or Ribery could end up
being The Man Who Won It All In 2006.</p>

<title>Canada Day Fireworks</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The only substantial show in Vancouver this year was at Nat Bailey, the
minor-league ballpark ten blocks from home, much written-about in this space.
Since Canada’s birthday is also my son’s we took him along and let him stay
til the end to see them.  They aren’t the world’s biggest fireworks, but the
intimacy you get in a little park like that is hard to beat, and nothing
improves the enjoyment of the fireworks experience so much as having a kid
along.   Now I’m going to waste your bandwidth with six different fireworks
pictures, none exhibiting any photo-realism.</p>

<title>Open Source and Money</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Simon Phipps made a speech at OSBC (he claims that, whatever was reported,
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/webmink?entry=software_market_3_0">this
is what he meant</a>).  Ben Rockwood, who’s a really smart guy, is
<a href="http://cuddletech.com/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=686">eloquently
revolted</a> by OSBC in general and Simon’s message in particular.
<i>[Ed. note: I have a bunch of technothings to write about which I’ve been putting 
off till midsummer braindeadness abates, but this is too urgent.]</i></p>
<p>Simon and Ben are both right.  In particular, Ben’s right that effectively
no Open Source software gets written for money.  I’ve written quite a bit over
the years (I suspect that Bonnie and Genx may actually survive me), 
all for some combination of these four reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To solve a problem I was facing.</p></li>
<li><p>To solve a problem I heard a lot of people complaining about.</p></li>
<li><p>To win a point in a technical argument, by example.</p></li>
<li><p>The code was interesting to write.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Ben’s also right that there’s something off-putting about OSBC; it’s
a show for hustlers, not developers.  There’s nothing inherently
wrong with that, it’s just that developers shouldn’t go there because of the
name and expect to find themselves among their own kind.
Pitches are still pitches even when they’re in
<a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/">S5</a> not PowerPoint.</p>
<p>But Simon’s right, too, that a lot of money is swirling around; and in
particular he’s right that the money happens when the software goes into
production.</p>
<p>It’s easiest to make the argument by example.  I didn’t write
Bonnie and Genx and Lark and so on for money.
But if I could figure out a way to get paid for maintaining and supporting
that code, I might just do it.
And I think that would be clean money; I wouldn’t have any qualms whatsoever
about taking it.  
And if I were going to deploy a bunch of OSS code, I’d find someone to cut a
support deal with.</p>
<p>But the next hacking project my Adult-ADD sidetracks me
into, it won’t be for money.</p>

<title>5✭♫: Tabula Rasa</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is the title of an album of music by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvo_Part">Arvo Pärt</a>, and of a
composition on that album.
I have a lot of music by Pärt, but if I had to recommend one record, or one
piece, both would be <cite>Tabula Rasa</cite>.
It’s complex, deep, and austere; and contains some of the most beautiful
sounds ever recorded.
<i>(“5✭♫” series introduction <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music">here</a>;
with <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music#p-1">an
explanation</a> of why the title may look broken.)</i></p>
<img src="Tabula-Rasa-cover.png" alt="Tabula Rasa, by Arvo Pärt" class="inline" />
<h2 id='p-1'>The Context</h2>
<p>I’ve written before about Pärt, about how I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/07/DeathByMusic">nearly died</a> listening
to <cite>Cantus in Memory of Benjamin Britten</cite>, which appears on this
record and which I thought was maybe the most beautiful piece of music written
in the twentieth century until I bought the record and listened to the title
track.</p>
<p>Go to Wikipedia or anywhere else and read about Pärt; it’s a compelling
story: Estonian survivor of Soviet orthodoxy, Orthodox devotee, jokes about a
“faith minimalism” section in record stores.  Quote, from the excellent
liner notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>“In the Soviet Union once, I spoke with a monk and asked him
how, as a composer, one can improve oneself.  He answered me by saying that he
knew of no solution.  I told him that I also wrote prayers, and set prayers
and the texts of psalms to music, and that perhaps this would be of help to me
as a composer.  To this he said, ‘No, you are wrong.  All the prayers have
already been written. You don’t need to write any more.  Everything has been
prepared.  Now you have to prepare yourself.’  I believe there’s a truth in
that.  We must count on the fact that our music will come to an end one day.
Perhaps there will  come a moment, even for the greatest artist, when he will
no longer want to or have to make art.  And perhaps at that very moment we
will value his creation even more — because in this instant he will have
transcended his work.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And in respect of the liner notes, I have to mention a company,
<a href="http://www.ecmrecords.com/Startseite/startseite.php">ECM Records</a>,
and its founder/producer
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_Eicher">Manfred Eicher</a>, the
producer not only for Pärt, but for Pat Metheny and also Keith Jarrett’s
astounding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_K%C3%B6ln_Concert">Köln
Concert</a>.  I’ll pretty well buy anything with his name on it.</p>
<p>(I have a personal relationship with Pärt; when I was playing cello
seriously, I invested some time in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiegel_im_Spiegel">Spiegel im
Spiegel</a> (“Mirror in a mirror”), endless high slow eight-beat cello notes
against surprising piano arpeggiations; if I ever go back to the cello, this
is the first piece I’ll play till I get it right.)</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Music</h2>
<p><cite>Tabula Rasa</cite> has either three or four tracks on it, depending
how you count.  That’s because one track, <cite>Fratres</cite>, appears twice,
performed once by Gidon Kremer and Keith Jarrett, and once by the 12 Cellists
of the Berlin Philharmonic.  I apologize for all the name-dropping; that’s
what the liner notes say.  <cite>Fratres</cite> is a lovely piece of music and
if you play it in company, people will be impressed at your discernment; but 
compared to the rest of the record, it’s filler.</p>
<p>You see, here’s Arvo Pärt’s dirty little secret: he talks the
Orthodox-ascetic talk and his music is spacious and spiritual and serene, 
but it’s also sensual and dynamic and dramatic, and on both the <cite>Cantus
in Memory of Benjamin Britten</cite> and <cite>Tabula Rasa</cite>, he gets
right out of control, and this is a good thing.</p>
<p>The <cite>Cantus</cite> is Pärt’s Big Hit, the one piece you might
have heard on late-night radio and thought “Gosh, that’s pretty”.  It’s more
than pretty; take it home and play it Really Loud and be astounded at the
string textures and the fading bell and the descending line and the sense that
God just might be listening along with you.</p>
<p>Before we get to the title track, I have to do a little fanboy raving about
Gidon Kremer, my personal favorite living violinist (he <em>owns</em> the
J.S. Bach solo repertoire).  Kremer doesn’t have the most beautiful tone or
anything close to it, he just plays all the notes with frightening pitch
accuracy for exactly the right length of time at exactly the right volume and
isn’t afraid to make the fiddle snarl or scream when that’s what’s called for,
and he knows when it’s called for.  Eicher captures
Kremer at his best on this disc.</p>
<img src="ap1.jpg" alt="Arvo Pärt" />
<img src="ap2.jpg" alt="Arvo Pärt and Gidon Kremer" />
<div class="caption"><p>Above, Pärt.  Below, Pärt and Kremer.  Pictures of the
composer are hard to come by, online, so I scanned these from the ECM CD
booklet, rather liking the scanning artifacts.  This may violate a copyright,
but I am probably prepared to argue Fair Use, particularly since I’m plugging
their product.</p></div>
<p>On the 26'26" of <cite>Tabula Rasa</cite>, Kremer is joined by violinist
Tatjana Gridenko, who frequently performs with him; and by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Schnittke">Alfred Schnittke</a>
(!) on prepared piano, backed by the Lithuanian Chamber Orchestra under
Saulus Sondeckis.  They all play like gods.</p>
<p>The music is I think a miniature symphony in three movements.  The first
juxtaposes jagged violin aggro, unbearably-tense silence, elegant string
counterpoint, and occasional drily distorted piano commentary.  It builds 
and retreats and builds and retreats and mounts to a
climax, unsubtly, unspiritually, unascetically, beautifully.
Then that climax doesn’t end, it goes on for three minutes of attacking string
ostinatos and prepared-piano snarls; and finally resolves.</p>
<p>Then there’s more.  Another sixteen minutes of that justly famous
Arvo Pärt Descending Line.  A certain amount of musical trickery is going
on here: the effect is that the music drifts down an unending scale for minute
after minute after minute; Pärt doesn’t let you hear the instruments dropping
out and sneaking up a couple of octaves back into the endless descent.
And I’ve never heard a musical effect quite like Schnittke’s prepared-piano
flourish at the end of 
each long musical breath; the effect is vaguely Japanese although the tonality
is comforting, some long-lost major mode.</p>
<p>It’s possible that I’m going over the top here.  But if music moves you,
and you retreat into a darkened room, and turn off the background noise, and
listen to <cite>Tabula Rasa</cite> really loud, you might find yourself doing
the same.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Sampling It</h2>
<p>Don’t be silly, just buy the silver disk, either direct off the Web from
<a href="http://www.ecmrecords.com/Startseite/startseite.php">ECM</a> or at
any other respectable storefront or webfront.  Every second on this disk is
worth listening to, and the sound quality is beyond superb, and the notions of
compressing this music, or encumbering it with DRM, or stealing it from a
pirate site, all of those partake of sacrilege.</p>
<p>Pärt’s written lots more music and almost all of it is worth buying.  But
don’t take my word for it, listen to <cite>Tabula Rasa</cite>.</p>

<title>Germany 0 Italy 2</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Well, that was quite a show.  Hey, LazyWeb, where’s the deep, erudite,
funny, World
Cup commentary to be found?  Who’s the Roger Angell of soccer?  The best I’ve
found is <a href="http://mondial2006.blogs.liberation.fr/mon_weblog/">Mondial
2006</a>, but something in my own language would be nice.  As for the game:
Cannavaro Cannavaro Cannavaro, what else is there to say?
<i>[Update:
<a href="http://www.oscarm.org/">Oscar Merida</a> writes to point at
<a href="http://www.soccerblogs.net">Soccer Blogs</a>, an aggregation with some
good stuff, while Marc Lacoste points to
<a href="http://www.cahiersdufootball.com">les cahiers du football</a> (en
français, obviously).]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Deutschland</h2>
<p>The Germans had grace and power and style and class and it’s sad to see
them go, even though Italy was the better team on the day.  You had to love
Klinsmann on the sidelines, exploding all those clichés about German reserve;
at one point I thought he’d literally tear his hair.  And Ballack commanding
the midfield, mostly winning the duel with Totti; now we won’t get to see
how he does against Zidane.  And those around-the-box passing sequences, no
other team comes close.</p>
<p>But they couldn’t score from outside, and they couldn’t get a scorer loose
inside either.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Half Right</h2>
<p>I predicted the Italians could do this, (correctly) pointing out the
flawless defense and (incorrectly) suggesting that they’d win by pouncing on
an error.  They had four great scoring chances and converted two; all four
were the result of high-speed on-the-run offensive creativity.  Which is to
say, they beat a team that really didn’t make any big mistakes.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Cannavaro</h2>
<p>Some idiot over at the FIFA site named Pirlo as Man of the Match, and
yeah, he did create the winning goal after all, but Cannavaro won the game.  He
stopped Klose and he stopped Ballack and he stopped Podolski and he stopped
Odonkor and he stopped Schneider and he stopped Schweinsteiger, most of them
more than once.  Buffon was sharp but didn’t need to be great, and the Italian
defensive machine ran smooth and cool and impermeable, but Cannavaro was the
knife in Germany’s heart.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Parting Shots</h2>
<p><i>Item:</i> Totti was only effective in the first half; has some combination
of age and injury caught up with him?  I was surprised they left him in, the
Italian bench is deep; but maybe they were thinking it’d go to penalties,
you’d want him then.  <i>Item:</i> Nobody’s set pieces worked worth a damn;
getting a corner or a free kick was worth approximately nothing in this game.
<i>Item:</i> Know who Benito Archundia is?  I didn’t think so.  He was the
referee, and the fact that you don’t remember him is a high compliment.  I
didn’t see a single blown call, and he was stingy with the cards too, so Italy
will have their best team there for the final.  That said, both teams deserve
credit for keeping it reasonably clean, although there were (as always) some
egregious dives.</p>
<p>Wasn’t it nice to see Del Piero get another notch on his belt?</p>
<p>That’s what a soccer game ought to be like.</p>

<title>The Prompt of Doom</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>You know the one I mean; when you visit some site that you haven’t been to
for a while, long enough that you’ve changed browsers or something expired,
and it asks you for your your username and password and you don’t have the
vaguest idea, so you guess, and the browser says “Remember this
username/password?”  I always get a sinking sensation, knowing that my
immediate future probably contains email confirmations (which will probably
end up in the spambucket) and half-forgotten password (is the answer
case-sensitive or not?) hints.  I confess to rankly superstitious behavior,
telling the browser “No, don’t remember it.” in the hopes that the general
orneriness of things will cause me to guess right.  I know some Internet
Identity gurus, and they say “It’s about so much more than single sign-on”,
but dammit, do I ever want single sign-on; and I can’t be the only one.</p>

<title>Measuring the Web</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is the title of a talk I gave on May 7th, 1996 (over ten years ago!)
at the Fifth International World Wide Web Conference, at La Défense in Paris.
It won a gold medal from the Mayor of Paris (one of two at the
conference thus distinguished) which I display in my office; I worked awfully
hard on that paper.
I wanted to cite it recently, but the WWW5 Web Site has been AWOL the last few
times I’ve tried to go there.  
Coincidentally, I ran across the conference CD in a recent
basement re-organization.  So I’ve staged it here:
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/199x/1996/05/07/OVERVIEW.HTM">Measuring
the Web</a>.  It’s no more than a historical curiosity now, but it’s a history
that’s not that well documented.  Plus there are some pretty pictures.
Occasionally I wonder what might have happened if I’d been smart enough to
follow up on the significance of the notion of “visibility”.</p>

<title>Microsoft &amp; ODF</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’ve been wondering how to react to this
<a href="http://sev.prnewswire.com/computer-electronics/20060705/SFTH05506072006-1.html">Microsoft
ODF Announcement</a>.  Andy Updegrove
<a href="http://consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/article.php?story=20060706092209358">points
out</a> that the news isn’t that new, but still I see this as significant.  
From a glass-half-empty point of view, I could object, as
<a href="http://www.sutor.com/newsite/blog-open/?p=783">Bob Sutor does</a>, to
the misdirection and outright lies in the Microsoft spin.  Or I could echo
<a href="http://www.sutor.com/newsite/blog-open/?p=783#comment-876">Mark
Pilgrim</a> in pointing out that this is currently largely vaporware (more details
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3809617">here</a>).
But I think that on balance the big story is that Redmond has moved from a
“There’s no demand for ODF” stance to admitting that, in fact, there is.
Currently, it’s largely a public-sector thing; and reading between the
mellifluous lines of Chris Capossela’s
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/interop/letters/new_world_of_docs.mspx">A Foundation for the New World of Documents</a>,
I sense a tone of barely-suppressed fear: “We encourage public sector
organizations to move to XML file formats but not to mandate a particular
format or implementation.”
We can all agree on implementation—that’s the point, after all—but to refuse
to bless a format seems to me to ignore the lesson of the Web, written in
letters of fire 500 feet high: agree on the smallest-possible number of data
formats, and compete on what you do with them.</p>

<p>Friday Slide Scan #33 is from early 1962; it features my bare bottom.</p>
<img src="B003-1.jpg" alt="Tim and Rob Bray in 1962" />
<p>This was in Married Student Housing at
<a href="http://oregonstate.edu/">OSU</a> in Corvallis, Oregon, where
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Dad</a> was working on his
Ph.D. and Mom was teaching; I revisited
the town in the Eighties and there’s no evidence left of these structures,
which, believe me, is no loss.
The handwritten note on the slide says that
<a href="http://takingalongview.blogspot.com/">Rob</a> is nine months old, so
I would have been 6&#xbd;.</p>
<p>Images in the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1953
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>, 
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/08/11/MomsGarden">Jean Bray</a>, Tim Bray, Cath
Bray, and
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>; when I know
exactly who took one, I’ll say; in this case, Bill Bray.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using
a Nikon CoolScan 4000 ED scanner and cleaned up by a combination of the Nikon
scanning software and PhotoShop Elements.</p>

<title>With Bloglines to Atom</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A few days back I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/06/29/Atom">noted approvingly</a> that
Bloglines was working on their long-broken Atom 1.0 handler;
and that there were a still a few relative-URI problems.  
I got a puzzled, polite email from a Bloglines engineer saying “Uh, are you
sure?  I don’t see that, might have been switchover artifacts.” 
I went and looked and sure enough, they were
gone. I did see one little Keith-and-the-roaches bug with a stray
“&amp;amp;” so I wrote back saying “fantastic, great work, oh BTW you’ve
got a stray ampersand”.  Within a few minutes he wrote back “Just fixed the
&amp;amp; issue.  It might not show up on production until later.” 
This is the way the Web is supposed to work.  (Sam Ruby tells me there are
some lingering corner-case bugs; report ’em and I bet they’ll fix ’em.)
As of now, I am absolutely recommending Bloglines to all newsreader newbies as
a good place to start; and also to anyone, newbie or not, who doesn’t want to
deal with the fuss and bother of a separate newsreading program.
And with Bloglines’ switch, every major piece of infrastructure that I know
of is now Atom 1.0-capable.  So I just permanently redirected
my RSS feed to the Atom 1.0 version.  If this looks weird in your newsreader, 
please do
let me know; and more important, file a bug so your reader gets fixed.
Once this settles down, I look forward to taking the axe to a whole bunch of
double-escaping and RSS-writing code.</p>

<title>World Cup, the Day Before</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Sunday is the big day.  I’m unlikely ever to watch as much of any
future World Cup as the combination of the new daughter and Sun’s summer pause
made possible this time.</p>
<p>First, in the last soccer fragment I asked for a pointer to good writing,
and got some, but there are a bunch more in the
<a href="http://worldcup.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=320">New York Times World Cup
Blog</a>.</p>
<p>I didn’t find much to write about France-Portugal.
I was
unabashedly pro-France; their masterly disposals of Spain and Brazil aside,
Portugal are just not very likeable.  Still, nobody would call it a brilliant
game; the better team won fairly, if perhaps with little genius.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Last Act</h2>
<p>The bookmakers don’t have a clear favorite, but the journos lean to
supporting Italy.  I’m with the bookies; the defeat of Germany was
magnificent, but if you look at the
<a href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/bracket.html">whole
playdown</a>, I’d say France had a tougher path to the final.</p>
<p>I find that emotionally I’m more drawn to France, if only on grounds of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiognomy">physiognomy</a>.
Which is to say, the Italians look like a bunch of movie stars, and the
French, um, don’t.  If I were out walking in the wrong part of
Marseilles and saw  Zidane, Ribery, and Vieira coming along the sidewalk
toward me, I’d find a reason to cross the street.  And Henry has a standup
comic’s face.
Speaking as one with a grizzled and at best ordinary countenance, I can
relate to those guys.</p>
<p>Also, speaking as one who is no longer young, I note with pleasure that
if you look at the teams’ midfield generals, Totti and Zidane, and 
total up the years younger their losing opponents’ midfielders were, you get a
pretty big number.</p>
<p>As for the game itself?  I don’t think Italy has any surprises to offer,
we’ve seen what they can do.  For <i>les Bleus</i>, Barthez could suddenly go
weird and freeze up and nobody would be surprised.  Henry hasn’t played up to
potential; if they figure out how to unleash him, he might be the one man in
the world who can blow a hole in the armor-plate around the Italian goal.  
Domenech might even go crazy and put Trezeguet in, and he might be so mad at
having been benched that he scores three goals just to make a point.</p>
<p>It <em>should</em> be close.  But then Brazil, Argentina, or Germany
<em>should</em> have won the Cup.</p>

<title>Comments on Camping</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last month I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/05/15/Comment-System">said</a> I’d make a
comment system for <span class='o'>ongoing</span>, and I got
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/05/20/Comments-on-Comments">lots of good</a>
advice.  Several of the people who wrote suggested I consider
<a href="http://camping.rubyforge.org/files/README.html">Camping</a>, so I
decided to give that a try, and started today.</p>
<p>Step 1, recent Ruby. Download, <code>./configure</code>, <code>make</code>,
<code>sudo make 
install</code>, OK.  Hmm, if Ruby’s there, why not Gems?  Download, <code>sudo
ruby setup.rb</code>, OK.  Now it wants SQLite...</p>
<p>Hrmph, I’m using Camping because I
don’t want to have one of those filthy database thingies in the loop.  I know
lots of perfectly decent and honorable people connect databases to websites at
runtime, and many of them go on to have happy and useful lives, in fact some
of my best friends use runtime databases (but my
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/06/11/Now-We-Are-Four">new daughter</a> isn’t
going to marry one of <em>them</em>).</p>
<p>But I digress.</p>
<p>Sigh, Fink doesn’t seem to know about SQLite3.  OK, go get ’er. 
Download. Make a
separate directory to build in?  Well, then: 
<code>../sqlite-3.3.6/configure</code>, <code>make</code>, <code>sudo make
install</code>, OK.</p>
<p>Now SWIG.  Dammit, this is supposed to be about coding, not drinking.
Download, <code>./configure</code>, <code>make</code>, <code>sudo make
install</code>, OK.</p>
<p>My laptop has now developed a tilt, one SWIG too many?  Or maybe that’s the side of the disk
where <code>/usr/local</code> lives.</p>
<p>OK, now for the last software appetizer: <code>sudo gem install sqlite3-ruby
</code>  Huh, gem is asking me whether I want 1.1.0 or 1.0.1, and whether I
want a “ruby” or “mswin32” version.  Hey Gem, if you need to ask there’s
nothing I can say that will help you.</p>
<p>We’re there!  <code>sudo gem install camping --source
http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/</code>
Hmph, it puked some error message about ActiveRecord documentation generation,
right, they complained about that on ruby-talk and apparently it can be
ignored.</p>
<p>Now, how do we get started...  Camping seems to have two or three different
home pages and a Wiki and not that much by way of “First Steps”.  Well, let’s
just poke around in the installation directory: <code>view README</code>.
Hah, now we’re cooking.  Anyone else considering going camping, that’s where
you start.</p>
<p>Does it run?  <code>camping blog.rb</code>  It’s creating tables
(grrr, I <em>spit</em> on your tables), it’s running WEBrick on port 3301,
and, hey there it is, I can write little blog entries! (Uh, “Submit Query”?
How last-millenium.)</p>
<img src="Camping-blog.png" alt="Camping runs!" />
<p>All right, let’s wrangle some code.  
Hey, Emacs’ ruby-mode seems very decent.</p>
<p>Now apparently I need to understand
something called
<a href="http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/markaby">Markaby</a>.  Um... it’s
trying to make Ruby look like markup. Or is it trying to make markup look like
Ruby?  I’m wondering why this is a good idea.  So, I replicate the fragment
and it doesn’t work because it needs <code>stylesheet_link_tag</code>, which
is apparently part of ActionView which is part of Rails.  But I do need a
stylesheet.  So how do I do a <code>link</code> element?  The
<a href="http://markaby.rubyforge.org/">docs</a> don’t seem to mention the
term “link”... hold on, the text for <code>method_missing</code>
is suggestive, suppose I just use</p>
<pre><code>    html do
      head { 
        title 'ongoing · comments'
        link \
        :rel => 'stylesheet',
        :href => 'http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/serif.css'
      }</code></pre>
<p>(Emacs is refusing to indent continuation lines, I wonder why?)  And it produces</p>
<pre><code>
<html>
<head>
<meta content="text/html; charset=utf-8" http-equiv="Content-Type"/>
<title>ongoing · comments</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/serif.css"/>
</head></html></code></pre>
<p>Yowie.  Uh, where’d that <code>DOCTYPE</code> and <code>meta</code> come
from?  
Maybe I don’t like <code>text/html</code>?  
And maybe I’m not an XHTML-transitional transsexual Transylvanian?
File for revisit.</p>
<p>At one point it was escaping the <code>&amp;</code> in
<code>&amp;#xbd;</code> and at another it wasn’t.  Keith,
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/05/31/KeithPlus">stomp that roach</a>!</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Checkpoint</h2>
<p>Yep, Camping does seem to provide something not entirely unlike an
application framework in a little file, provided of course you download and
install several acres of infrastructure.
It’ll be on Debian in production, I’m thinking<br/>
<code>apt-get install everything-you-need-for-Camping</code><br/>
Sorry, lost my head there.</p>
<p>I think I can use this.</p>
<p>Um, what is this WEBrick and this Mongrel of which you speak?  
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> is and will remain served by Apache dammit and
I don’t want any more Web servers facing the big wild Internet,
thankyouverymuch.  Presumably there must be a way to
connect A to C; push it on the stack.</p>
<p>Also, I have firm and fixed and really unreasonably inflexible ideas about
URIs, for example, the fact that the <code>serif.css</code> URI above is
absolute is a huge fucking stinky <em>bug</em>.  I will wrestle this
infrastructure to the ground and if it cavils at my orders about What The
URI Will Be it will end up saying “May I have another, sir?” pretty damn
quick.</p>
<p>I think that this will go quite quickly.  And that it won’t use SQLite.</p>

<title>Thumper &amp; Friends</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We
<a href="http://www.sun.com/nc/2006-0711/index.jsp">announced</a> a bunch of
new boxes this morning (of, course, the damn
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/">Register</a> has had the
poop for weeks, I find our leakiness irritating).  There’s a
<a href="http://www.sun.com/servers/x64/x4600/">Real Big Opteron
server</a> (personally, I’m more of a scale-out than scale-up kinda guy, but big
iron is a big part of our business).  There’s a
<a href="http://www.sun.com/servers/blades/8000/">blade box</a>.  
I know nothing about blades, never been near one.  Then there’s the
<a href="http://www.sun.com/servers/x64/x4500/">Thumper oops X4500</a>, it’s
interesting.  I even have a grainy amateurish photo of the inside of a
pre-production model.</p>
<p>At a recent internal meeting, we got an up-close-and-intimate walk-through
from Andy Bechtolsheim on How It Works; if we could figure out how to clone
him and give the whole world that kind of pitch, we’d sell these things by the
freighter-load.
Suffice it to say that the maintainability and I/O bandwidth of these boxes
are remarkable.</p>
<p>Now, the Thumper; it’s a 4U box with two fast dual-core Opterons and some
silly, idiotic, enormous number of 250G or 500G disks.
And really big, fat pipes throughout.  Here are a few of the disks.</p>
<img src="Thumper-inside.jpg" alt="Inside a Sun X4500" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Ask the Bloggers</h2>
<p>When I was getting ready to write this, I had a detail question about the
Thumper, and since all the people I know in the Systems org are out on the
marketing road-show today, I asked the internal bloggers’ list, and that turned
out to be a smart move, I learned some interesting things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If one of the disks fails, the little LED beside it lights up.  The
software handles it (see below) and things go on running; the intent is that
you service it about once a year, swapping out the failed drives, which are
easy to find.  Bringing down maintenance costs is a big deal with a lot of our
customers.</p></li>
<li><p>The LEDs are actually three-state: activity (Green), OK-to-remove
(Blue), and Fault (amber).</p></li>
<li><p>It ain’t light.  I suppose we’ll do a try-and-buy, and if you try one,
please don’t try to hoist into place yourself.  I gather that internally, we
use a
<a href="http://www.genielift.com/ml-series/ml-1-3.asp">Genie
Lift</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-2'>SATA What?!?!</h2>
<p>Now, here’s the really interesting part.  These are all SATA disks; i.e.,
pretty fast, really cheap, typically regarded as not suitable for use in big
back-room servers.  The thing that makes it all work is ZFS, which goes fast
not by using the fastest disks, but by using lots of paths to the data, and
which assumes that disks are going to fail sometimes and is built to just deal
with it.</p>
<p>Remember, RAID used to stand for Redundant Array of <em>Inexpensive</em> Disks?
That’s the idea here.
This sucker was originally designed as a streaming-video server.  But
everywhere I look I see the data getting bigger and bigger and the transaction
rate getting higher and higher.  So I bet there are lots of places where this
will come in handy.</p>

<title>The Databox</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>After I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/07/11/NSG-Boxes">reported on</a> the Thumper
announcement yesterday, Simon Phipps wrote:
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/webmink?entry=love_at_tera_byte">I

weights 77kg and probably sounds like a 747.”  But last night, coincidentally,
I ran a backup, which provoked thought, and you know, I think Simon’s
right, I think there’s a huge opening for a consumer product in this space.
<i>[Update: Hah!
<a href="http://wcpierce.spaces.msn.com/blog/cns!676A55AA5C4FB1BE!202.entry">Bill Pierce specs
out</a> a Databox, it’ll cost you $2,312.33; dig it!]</i></p>
<p>Early this year I wrote
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/31/Data-Protection">Protecting Your
Data</a>; if the ideas in there became widely publicized, that would probably
constitute my single largest contribution to humanity.
I think what I’m about to propose is in tune with those ideas. </p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Presenting the Databox</h2>
<p>The Databox has one or two cheap-ish CPUs running Solaris, ten or so
cheapish disks, and offers a half-terabyte or so of completely
reliable, completely maintainable, network-accessible
storage for your data, which lives in
ZFS, striped and replicated across the disks.</p>
<p>Occasionally, one of the disks
might fail.  When this happens, you won’t lose any data, but a red light on
the Databox will start flashing,  and it will send mail to a few designated
addresses.  When this happens, it’s exactly like when your laser printer
starts saying “You need to replace the cyan ink” or “You need to buy a new printer
drum”;
next time you go shopping, you swing by Best Buy or Costco and pick up another
disk unit.  When you get home, you open the top of the Databox, pull out
the disk with the red LED turned on, drop in the new one,  and toss out the
old one.
Now that I think of it, if you get the interfaces right you don’t even have to
have the same capacity disks.</p>
<p>If you configured this right, you could be really very sure that you
wouldn’t lose data; ZFS should sail through power failures and so on.</p>
<p>I’d sell the Databox with some sort of physical locking attachment like some
home safes have; you could screw it to the studs in the wall so that it would
be too much work for burglars to take if you had a break-in.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Why Do We Need It?</h2>
<p>Simple: Consumer HD video.  Juggling DV tapes or even DVDs generally
sucks, I just want to have a place in the basement to store my video and be
really sure it’ll still be there when I go to get it.</p>
<p>I could probably build a Databox if I really had to; but then I work for a computer
builder these days, so I shouldn’t have to.</p>

<title>Another Baseball Proposal</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Back in July 2004, I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/24/WillYou">wrote about</a> going to a
baseball game with fireworks, and a marriage proposal unexpectedly breaking
out on the field.  I guess this must be somewhat of a tradition, because it
happened again this last Canada Day, where, once again, I took 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/07/03/July-1-Fireworks">fireworks
pictures</a>.  Only there was a different spin this time, and I got photos
of the proposal too.  I thought the whole thing was too tacky to write up, but
the pictures have been playing on my mind every time I go past them in the
July-pix folder.  And the story is not entirely without interest; so make up
your own mind.</p>
<p>On fireworks nights, what they do is cordon off the foul territory outside
the first- and third-base lines, and let the crowd in the stands go sit there
so they’re out from under the grandstand roof and can see the show.  The home
team came out and hung out on the field in front of the dugout, too.</p>
<p>This evening, they had a fly-ball catching contest and some other
entertainment, then this attractive young blonde woman and a member of the
ball-park staff came and stood on the pitcher’s mound, she carrying a slip of
paper, obviously waiting for the song on the PA to end so they could do the next
part of the show.
Suddenly, one of the players was trotting out to the mound, then he was
kneeling, and, well, you can guess the rest.  This is the picture that kept
grabbing at me.</p>
<img src="IMGP3585.jpg" alt="Baseball player kisses his new fiance on the pitcher’s mound" />
<p>Which was after the proposal.
I was of two minds about the whole thing, and Lauren, when I told her about it
(she’d left early with the baby) was acid: “Talk about putting a woman in an
impossible position.”
Yeah, OK, tacky.  And yet, somehow, the fact that the suitor was a player,
there on the stage where he performs, seemed to make it a little more
appropriate.
And when she said Yes, his teammates burst out in a lusty cheer, no irony in
it that I could spot.  The moment
was suddenly very old-fashioned.</p>
<p>Still, the sidekick (below in shorts), there to capture it with the
microphone for the 
PA system, did seem a little over the edge.</p>

<p>Like your syndication politics tasty and fresh?  Head over
to
<a href="http://www.unto.net/unto/">DeWitt Clinton’s Unto.net</a> and read
<a href="http://www.unto.net/unto/work/on-rss-and-atom/">On RSS and Atom</a>.
Clinton’s at A9, Amazon.com’s Silly Valley search-wonk cauldron, and his stuff
keeps coming across my radar in recent weeks.  Anyhow, he has what seems to me
a clear-eyed and dispassionate evaluation of the feed-format choices facing
implementors these days.  There is one place he gets it backward, saying:
“I’ve been consistently impressed with how well the authors of the Atom
syndication format anticipated the needs of the advanced content syndication
community.”  No; Atom’s design reflects the
<em>backward</em>-looking experience we got in the last few years of working
with RSS; it turns out that the future is somewhat like the past.
But don’t stop when you get to the end of DeWitt’s piece, there are dozens of
comments, most of them instructive, coming at the issue from all sorts of directions.
Scoble pushed back at length, follow the pointer from his comment.  Someone
who signs himself “Raja” has an <em>awfully</em> familiar style.
And a final note: when Mr. Clinton talks about XML, for example an RSS
<code>&lt;description></code> element, he says
<code>&lt;description/></code>.  Now, that’s the kind of pedantry I can relate to.</p>

Ah, YouTube, feels like the Napster glory days; beyond any doubt a life-enhancer.
Colby Cosh has innocent fun
<a href="http://www.colbycosh.com/#csph">searching it by date</a>.

And speaking of magnificent silliness.... Syd.  Bye, Syd.  He never made it
out of the Sixties and I had a
few friends not make it out of the Seventies, you can burn the candle at both
ends and in the middle too, but not for that long.  I looked into the record

It’s hard to know what to think of PF these days.  Their later work is far too

picked out of his London gutter wearing an “I Hate Pink Floyd”

<title>Rubies and Pearls</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’m still feeling my way into this comments system, but my first days with
Ruby are making me think back a dozen years or more, to when I was learning
Perl.  It was a big data-filtering job and
<a href="http://www.textscience.com/">Michael Leventhal</a> had pulled
together a very typical Perl bundle-of-regexps and suddenly one day I was pitching in
on handling more types of input data and pulling out more structure.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall">Larry Wall</a>, the author
of Perl, is a linguist by training, and is proud of the
fact that with Perl, as with a natural language, you don’t have to be an
expert to be effective  Just as a child derives value from using English
even if inexpertly, a novice Perl programmer starts being rewarded quickly.
Other languages have this characteristic to a greater or lesser degree; and
I’m beginning to think Ruby is right up there.  (For me, Java had it too, as it
would I think for any expert C programmer comfy with O-O thinking.)   At the
moment, there are lots of Ruby idioms that are still gibberish to me; but I find
two crucial things: my pidgin Ruby is already pretty useful for getting things
done, and I’m learning new tricks.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I accidentally hit some magic keystroke (command-F5, I later
found out), 
which turned on Mac OS X’s “voice over” accessibility
feature, and there was this droning insurance-agent voice in my headphones,
louder than the music, telling me where my mouse was going and what menu I was
pulling down and what app I was switching to.  I was completely rattled and
started frantically working through the System Preferences, with audio
commentary of course, to Make My Damn

wing and was swearing at the camera as it laboriously turned itself on and got

<title>No Database!?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Recently, in discussion of a design for a comments system, I noted that I
wasn’t planning to use a database, and I even allowed my self a little fun
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/07/10/Gone-Camping">sneering</a> at the
idea.  I got several reasonable-sounding emails from reasonable-sounding
people saying “Why on earth wouldn’t you?”  Here’s why.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Current Setup</h2>
<p><span class='o'>ongoing</span> actually uses a database right now, MySQL to
be precise.  But not at run-time; it only gets involved when I hit
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Colophon">the Publish button</a>.  And I don’t really
need it; it just lets me push some work down into the SQL engine that I’d
otherwise have to write a few lines of code for, as in the fragments on the
front page:<br/>
<code>SELECT uri FROM Essays ORDER BY updated DESC LIMIT
$maxOnHomePage;</code><br/>
Also in randomizing the picture:<br/>
<code>SELECT essay, dir, src, alt, UNIX_TIMESTAMP(potd) FROM Pix ORDER BY
RAND();</code></p>
<p>But at run-time, all the data you’re seeing comes out of static files, pulled in
either with <code>img</code> or <code>link</code>, and a bit via
<code>XMLHttpRequest</code>.
This is good.  It means that the little Athlon that runs 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> (and some other sites) can serve 130G/month,
200K transactions/day, and can stand up to a Slashdotting without breathing
hard.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Comment Storage</h2>
<p>I may yet use a database for comments; but not at the runtime end.
Which is to say, the comments themselves will live in flat files, and the
per-article comment counts will too, the latter being pulled in by
XMLHttpRequest in the obvious way.</p>
<p>I suspect that it’ll be handy to have a database to look things up by IP
address as part of the spam-control effort.  But really, I won’t do that
unless it saves work.  You could perfectly easily do per-IP-address data lookup in
a little directory tree where the data for <code>12.110.110.204</code> lives
in a file named <code>ip-info/12/110/110/204</code>.
Yeah, it might not run as fast as a MySQL lookup, and I’d bet it definitely
wouldn’t be as fast as a BerkeleyDB lookup, but it’ll be pretty damn fast, and
it won’t interact toxically with anything else the database might be
doing.
On the other hand, it’ll probably be less work to just make a database table,
and “less work” trumps “runs fast” except when it doesn’t.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Why?</h2>
<p>I <em>like</em> the semantics of the Unix filesystem, and I also really
like the fact that whether you’re talking ufs, ext3, zfs, or whatever, this is
some of the world’s most thoroughly-debugged and battle-hardened code.
Also, most modern operating systems are really quite clever at noticing when
part of the filesystem is getting hammered and caching the whole thing in
memory, so you may never go near a disk.</p>
<p>I’m not religious—I’ve deployed runtime databases where I’ve had to.
But there is a psychology out there in our profession,which says: if you
have data that you want to store and retrieve, that means you need a database.
But sometimes you don’t.  And sometimes you come out ahead on one or both of
the less-work and runs-fast metrics by not having one.</p>

<p>What with the recent

enlargement</a>, it wasn’t clear that I was going to be able to get to
<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2006/">OSCON</a>.
But the girl’s settling down pretty well, so I decided to go.  I reviewed the
schedule and was horrified to see nothing about the Atom Publishing Protocol,
which I’m increasingly convinced is hot stuff.  So I sent a note off to
<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/nat/">Nat Torkington</a> saying “WTF, no
APP?!?” and he wrote back saying “So submit a paper already” and I did and now
I’m on the program.  I think I can only go for two days, but Portland’s a
great town for beer and bookstores, which there’s more to life than, but only
moderately.

<title>Want a New Pony?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>In Java, you’d say <code>new Pony("black")</code>, and the pony is made by
<code>Pony(String color)</code>.  In Ruby, you’d say
<code>Pony.new("black")</code> and the pony-maker is
<code>initialize(color)</code>.  In Python, you’d say
<code>Pony("black")</code> and the pony-maker is
<code>__init__(self, color)</code>. 
I wonder which is best?  Does all this seem kind of ad-hoc?
Anyhow, in real life, a Java programmer
would start with an <code>AbstractEquineBreederGenerator</code> and work from
there.  And for Ruby you’d be able to say 
<code>mySpecialPresent.get do | pony |</code>, and it would clean up the pony
poop for you (but the  pony would be named Kurofune).  Python programmers are

<title>The DOM Song</title>

<body>
<p>Weirdly enough, having been around XML for so long, the last couple of days
have marked my first exposure to actual DOM wrangling in code.  This
experience has driven many computer programmers to gloom, and even negative
utterances.  Not 
me!  I even composed a song about it.</p>
<p>Sung to the tune of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_You_Need_Is_Love">All You Need is Love</a>,
only with a sung chorus replacing the oom-pa-pa between the verse lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>Verse:<br/>
<i>All you need is nodes!<br/>
(Node node node node node)<br/>
All there is is nodes!<br/>
(Node node node node node)<br/>
All you need is nodes, nodes,<br/>
Nodes are all there is.</i><br/>
Bridge:<br/>
<i>There’s nothing nodes can’t do that can be done<br/>
There’s nothing nodes can’t sing that can be sung<br/>
Nothing you can say but you can learn to code the nodes<br/>
It’s easy</i><br/>

<i>Nodes, nodes, nodes...<br/>

<p>The commentary is voluminous and I don’t think I have much to add,
so I’ll keep my contribution short.  Directing military force in such a way
that it kills hundreds of civilians is unacceptable behavior, and any group,
tribe, or nation that does so loses all moral standing.  Those who are
defending this behavior need to have a close look at the axioms and arguments
that lead them to such a deeply broken conclusion.

<title>On Ruby</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I have previously
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/08/27/Ruby">admired</a> the Ruby language,
albeit from a distance, and 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/04/13/RoR">been impressed</a> by the vigor of
the Rails community.
In the last week I have written a few hundred lines of Ruby code that actually
do something useful and I’ll probably release (come see it at
<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2006/">OSCON</a>); so now I’m
somewhat better educated.</p>
<p>What happened was, I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/07/17/OSCON">got a paper accepted</a> at
OSCON, and since that “S” stands for “Source” I thought it would be
lame to get up on stage without some, and decided
that an inflexible deadline would be the right way to overcome my laziness and
adult-ADD and actually learn something.
So if you come to my talk, you’re going to see some (I hope) entertaining Ruby
hackery, with an unusual twist, in a good cause.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>What’s Good</h2>
<p>I’ll jump to the conclusion first.  For people like me, who are proficient
in Perl and Java, Ruby is remarkably, perhaps irresistibly, attractive.
Over the last week I’ve got an unreasonable amount of work done in a
ridiculously short period of time, with lots of interruptions, in a language
I previously didn’t know.  It’s intuitive enough that I’ve often found myself
guessing at a syntax or a method or a usage and getting it right first time.</p>
<p>Maybe the single biggest advantage is readability.  Once you’ve got over
the hump of the block/yield idiom, I find that a chunk of Ruby code shouts its
meaning out louder and clearer than any other language.
Anything that increases maintainability is a pearl beyond price.</p>
<img src="ends.png" class="inline" alt="Superfluous 'end' statements in Ruby" />
<p>In theory, Python ought to do better, lacking all those silly
<code>end</code> statements cluttering up the screen.  But in practice, when
I look at Python code I find my eyes distracted by a barrage of underscores
and double-quote marks.   Typography is an important component of human
communication, and Ruby’s, on balance, is cleaner.</p>
<p>As for Java; I’ve always found it readable, and while there is too
much boilerplate, at least the superfluous delimiters
are just a character apiece.   But because Ruby does so much more with each
statement, you can get more pieces of the puzzle in the little bit of the
screen that you can look at and think about comfortably.
This is just one of the many reasons why fewer-lines-of-code is a Really
Important Virtue.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I’ve been programming in C and Java for a quarter-century and I find
Ruby easier to read, only a week in.  (Well, except for some of _why’s code.)</p>
<p>Also, it doesn’t take a lot of study before you’re saving lines of code;
I’ve 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/07/15/Rubies-and-Pearls">already written</a>
about Ruby’s low barrier to entry.</p>
<p>Here’s another virtue that I’ve observed but can’t explain.  Something
about Ruby results in me writing little teeny
methods; and when I write a loop that threatens to spill out of a screen I
just know that the language probably provides a better way to do it.
(It’s not just a virtue of dynamic languages; the Perl code that
deals with an image reference in <span class='o'>ongoing</span> spills across
more screenfuls than I want to admit.)</p>
<p>Of course, a language’s culture is often more important than all that
technical crap.  I’ve found the
<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/20020104.html">ruby-talk</a> mailing list
to be a fount of wisdom and friendly to ignorant newbies too.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Ruby_Shell">IRB</a> is
seriously wonderful.  I have to wonder heretically why IRB and Ruby are
different programs, but that seems to be Just The Way It Is.
If you’re new to IRB, learn to use the <code>-r</code> option to load up a
class or two and then poke away at methods.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>What’s Mixed</h2>
<p>Some things about Ruby are troubling me, they could be a lot better but
they could be a lot worse too.   I guess the leading candidate is
documentation.</p>
<p>I’ve previously written that I think the
<a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/ruby/index.html">Pickaxe
book</a> is way better than 
average.  It’s approximately as good as the
Camel book as a reference, and quite a bit better as a tutorial; I can’t
compare it to <cite>Learning Perl</cite> because I already knew perl before I
discovered that book.  A few days and a few hundred lines of
production-plausible code in, my Pickaxe is looking shopworn.
And, by the way, I repeat my assertion that several of the examples used to
illustrate language features also illustrate <em>horrible</em> programming
practice.</p>
<img src="nothing-known.png" alt="Silly Ruby 'ri'" class="inline" />
<p>Online, Ruby has <code>ri</code>, which is nowhere near as good as either
<code>perldoc</code> or the practice of right-clicking on anything in a
NetBeans window and saying “Show Javadocs” (I assume Eclipse has the
equivalent).</p>
<p>On the other hand, there’s the
<a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/">Ruby-Doc.org</a> Web site, which 
is incomplete but useful.  Here’s why: for every method
in every class, there’s a View source button, and
as I’ve already remarked, Ruby source is unusually readable, and at the end of
the day the source is the Ultimate Truth about what the software really does.
So, on balance, it’s pretty good.  Here’s an example of an important method
that’s completely undocumented but the source tells you what you need to
know.</p>
<img src="ruby-doc.png" alt="Documentation of a method in Net::HTTP" />
<h2 id='p-4'>What’s Lame</h2>
<p>Damn, I miss my IDE.  I am proficient in two IDEs, Emacs and NetBeans, and
neither of them does auto-complete on my Ruby code.  It is deeply wrong when
characters that could in principle be supplied by a computer must be typed by
a human, and deeply wrong when there’s an obvious syntax error in your code
and your editor doesn’t let you know.
I gather that both
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rubyeclipse">Eclipse</a> and
<a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000270.html">TextMate</a> can be made
to be smart about Ruby.  I’d really like to avoid having to learn a new
editor.  Sigh.  Anyone in Prague listening?</p>
<p>Ruby has a kind of stand-offish attitude towards two of my favorite pieces
of infrastructure, XML and Unicode.  
<a href="http://www.germane-software.com/software/rexml/">REXML</a> provides a
nice API, but, as
<a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/2005/09/14/Last-Line-of-Defense/">Sam
Ruby discovered</a>, has big-enough holes that you can’t point it at Arbitrary
Internet XML and hope for good results.</p>
<p>I’m still learning about the Ruby/Unicode issues, but for the moment,
suffice it to say that the
<a href="http://www.geocities.jp/kosako3/oniguruma/">most advanced Ruby regex
technology</a> doesn’t do Unicode properties.  Blecch.</p>
<p>Finally, a minor, almost a footnote, issue.  I miss polymorphism.  In
particular, I miss polymorphic constructors.  Sometimes you make pancakes by
taking them out of the freezer and thawing them.  Sometimes you use
<a href="http://www.thedailychannel.com/recipes/pancakes1.htm">baking power,
flour, and eggs</a>.  Sometimes you use a mix (and there are some
<em>excellent</em> 
pancake mixes available at your local organic-food retailer).
Software’s like that, too.
I find Ruby’s argument lists (required args, optional args, an
array, &amp;block) kind of ad-hoc and kludgey.  But if you embrace the virtues
of duck typing (and I do), I guess you pay a price in polymorphism and that’s
How Life Is.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Conclusions</h2>
<p>See above.  But, now that I’m getting comfy with Ruby, I’m wondering why
I need to use any frameworks at all for my
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/05/20/Comments-on-Comments">comment
system</a>.  Templates, ORM, MVC; 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2002/09/18/Bah">bah</a>, who needs ’em?</p>

<title>Contribution and Experience</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>“User-Generated Content” is an irreparably ugly and
broken phrase.
First, we’re people, not “users”.  Second, people write and
speak and design and compose and sing and play and build and earn and pay; 
machines “generate”.  
Third, it’s words and pictures and sound and money, not “content”.
The trouble is, we need labels; short ones that still say something.
Say, <em>contribution</em> and <em>experience</em>?  The Net (really, truly)
is the sum of  billions of contributions from millions of people, and
that’s all that’s interesting about it.
People contribute
at the edge, and experience the contributions at the edge.
(Experience, not consume; the difference is obvious).
The Net itself’s a contribution, by humanity to humanity, 
the engine of future contribution and experience.  The Net’s not finished of
course; contributing and experiencing, both of them, are too hard and awkward
and slow.</p>

John also argued that the way to fix this kind of problem is not, as I
proposed, for Apple to open-source its apps, it’s for them to be sufficiently
scriptable that you can just put a bandage over this kind of bleeding neck
wound.
Well,

at “end.com/speth”.  While its authorship is carefully unclaimed, my awesome
powers of detection aided by fifteen seconds at the nearest search engine
suggest that one Jim Speth is da man, or maybe da dog.
I installed the patch and it works.  Hey Apple, get a clue and just stop this
pain.  Mr. Speth, next time we’re in the same town, beers are on me.  Does
this mean John Gruber’s right?  Maybe; but Apple would still come out ahead by
open-sourcing its apps.</p>

<title>OSCON - Open Data</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>During the opening plenary, Tim O’Reilly suggested
that the importance of software licensing is decreasing.
Software is increasingly a service, running on the Net, while licensing to
date has focused on what’s running on your computer.  He reported an
astounding remark by Stallman, to the effect that his radical notions of
freedom are not applicable to the services we all use every day.
Tim asks: What standard of open-ness can we apply to Software-as-a-Service
offerings, to the Googles, Yahoos, and Amazons of this world?
It’s a really important question.  I think I know the answer.
<i>[Update: Interesting <a href="http://kontrawize.blogs.com/kontrawize/2006/07/set_my_data_fre.html">follow-up
from Tony Coates</a>.]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Set My Data Free</h2>
<p>At the end of the day, information outlives software and transcends
software and is more valuable than software.
I think any online service can call itself “Open” if it makes, and lives up
to, this commitment: <em>Any data that you give us, we’ll let you take away
again, without withholding anything, or encoding it in a proprietary format, or
claiming any intellectual-property rights whatsoever.</em></p>
<p>It seems to me that if you don’t have that, you have nothing, and if you do
have it, you have, if not everything, at least a solid foundation to build on.</p>
<p>That’s basic, Level 0, openness.
For extra credit, a service could also say: <em>We acknowledge your interest
in any value-added information we distill from what you give us, and will
share it back with you to the extent we can do so while preserving the privacy
of others.</em></p>
<p>So, do we need some sort of Open Service analogue of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Definition">Open Source
Definition</a>?
It couldn’t hurt.  I suspect that if we can get the basic idea across, 
then we’re in old-fashioned consumer-advocacy territory; and I suspect that it
will only take a small number of painful experiences for consumers to
understand the issue at a pretty deep level.</p>
<p>Anyhow, good on Tim for turning the spotlight on this.</p>

<title>OSCON Notes</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I have a bunch of notes and thoughts scattered round my computer and brain
and I was going to do a big round-up post, but who knows, something
might turn out to be a conversation-starter, so I guess I’ll split ’em all up to keep
things orderly.
Before I get going on that, I just want to say “Thanks!” to the O’Reilly
people for putting on this event.  What with the new baby I could only stay
for about 48 hours, but it felt like a 48-hour-long warm bath for the soul.  
Not only am I among my tribe, but the people are mostly friendly and mostly
witty and quite a few of them are stylish in offbeat and interesting ways, and
then a whole bunch of them have become friends over the years.
The talks weren’t, on average, as good as the crowd, on average, but then some
of them were excellent.
Here’s a question: should OSCON become partly an UnConference or Camp or
something?  
I’ve been to some of those and I really like them, but on the other hand,
quite a few of the OSCON sessions amount to someone who Really Knows
His-or-Her Shit standing on stage laying out what the next few steps are in
some deeply important piece of the computing ecosystem.  I mean, welcoming
grass-roots voices is good, but if you want to know where Python is going, you
need to listen to Guido, and if you want the bleeding edge on the Atom
Protocol, along with a command-line demo, I’m your guy.
Which is to say, information transfer from obsessives is a valid sub-function of
tribal gatherings.
Having said that, during this kind of session, the dialogue with the audience
is organic and spontaneous and the questions are typically so good that
there’s really no “authority” relationship between the person with at the
front of the room with the microphone and a person in one of the chairs
facing them.
Still, I think OSCON would benefit from turning one of its days—or even
half—into an UnConference.
Stand by for more OSCON-driven fragments.

<title>OSCON—Perl &amp; Python</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I managed to attend most of both Guido van Rossum’s talk on Python 3000, and
Larry Wall with Damian Conway on Perl 6.
It’s refreshing to look at technologies that have passed that tenth birthday that
seems to be crucial for software to establish that it’s real, and to see that
they’re living and squirming and growing.  Python, per its culture, seems to
be treading a straight-and-narrow path on a well-defined schedule guided by a
ruthlessly rational set of design criteria.
On a technical note, Python 3 will have a String type that is 100% Unicode and
that’s all it is, and separately a byte-array type that lets you indulge your most
squalidly-perverse bit-bashing fantasies.  I approve.
Perl, on the other hand, is whimsical and witty and unscheduled and blithely
disregards many genera of conventional wisdom.  One could easily have concluded,
listening to Larry and Damian, that the problem with previous versions of perl
was that they didn’t have enough syntax, and thus there was an urgent need to
add more.  It ill behooves me to diss Larry Wall’s language designs,
since I have successfully internalized all but the most perverse (typeglob,
blecch) of those that are here today and they have enabled me to wrangle large
amounts of data in surprisingly little time with generally-popular results.
Nothing would warm my heart more than Perl 6 leaping to the center of the
dynamic-language stage and reclaiming mindshare.  The jury’s out.</p>

To anyone and everyone who happens to read this: a big “Thank you!” 
I <em>think</em> I’d go on writing if no-one were reading (but I haven’t had

what I write has no relation to what others think about what I write; as

I have failed to learn what people want to read.  Which is on balance a good

<title>Involuntary Ubuntu</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This morning I got a contract in the email from a lawyer and clicked on it,
and MS Word started opening. Sigh. Then, my Mac locked up.  After I cycled
the power a couple of times, it was essentially a brick. Can I blame
Microsoft?  It’s off at the Mac doctor now, no prognosis, no ETA. <i>[Update:
Fried logic board, new one on order, they can’t say when it’ll be here.]</i>
I’m learning how to actually work full time on Ubuntu really fast (that was
the current most up-to-date install on the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/10/18/New-Computer">Ultra 20</a>, and I
really did not want to invest any OS-install time).
If you’re reading this, I’m moving along OK; this is the first-ever 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> post not authored on and posted from a Macintosh.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Good</h2>
<p>You know, this has been said a lot, but it bears repeating:
Apt-get is just so unreasonably fucking great.  Why aren’t we using it for 
Solaris updates?
I managed to pull together the whole witches’ brew of OSS that makes 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> go without ever leaving Synaptic.  Oops, not
quite true, I cruised past CPAN to get DBI and DBD::MySQL, but I’m not sure I
needed to, because when I got MySQL, I saw a lot of perl-related stuff go
flying by.</p>
<p>The thing I was really scared of was getting all my Emacs customization
pulled over, but that was pretty well 100% painless.  Almost all my
keybindings even worked.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Bad</h2>
<p>Thunderbird can’t see some of my IMAP folders on the Sun server.  No idea
why. <i>[Update: Because I hadn’t “subscribed” to them.  Why should I have to
do this?]</i></p>
<p>Some things are anti-aliased, but Emacs isn’t, and the jaggies are hurting
my brain.  So I’m using this monstrous 14-point Courier bold to help me ignore
them.</p>
<p>“Ispell” doesn’t work in Emacs; the Net is full of people asking about the
dreaded “Ispell misalignment” message, but none of the answers worked.
Blecch; I need a working spell-checker.
<i>[Update: Several people have written telling me to use aspell instead of
ispell.  I am; that’s the default on Ubuntu, and it’s broken.  I think it may
be related to me having everything in Unicode-by-default.]</i></p>
<p>The MySQL Admin GUI is broken as shipped.  I didn’t even know it existed,
so I thought I’d spare myself the mental pain of remembering how to define
users and databases and so on; but every time I selected the User Admin
function, it just locked up.  Anyhow, a quick poke around the Web led me to
the necessary <code>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO TBRAY@LOCALHOST IDENTIFIED
BY ...</code> voodoo.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>The Funny</h2>
<p>I finally got to the point where the publishing software would attempt to
run  without whining about missing pieces, wrote the first couple
paragraphs of this and optimistically hit the “proof” key;
disappointingly, nothing happened.  So I swore and started poking around, and
it took a couple of minutes to realize that the Emacs/Perl/MySQL monster was
is so much faster on the Ultra than the Mac that the proofing was finished
before my finger had left the key and the “Proofing...” advisory was gone
before I’d seen it.</p>

<p>I should really not write about Lebanon, but I can’t stop.  I’d like to
draw your attention to
<a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/NR/exeres/9EE216D7-82EF-4274-B80D-6BBD1803E8A7,frameless.htm?NRMODE=Published">Hizbullah attacks along Israel's northern border May 2000 - June 2006</a>,
a June 2006 document from Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who are
presumably 
experts on the subject.  Go read it yourself.  I’d like to write some more on
truce-breaking, on killing civilians and hiding among them, and about whom
it’s appropriate to be angry at.  
If you don’t feel like reading what I have to say (and it’s not very
cheerful), go have a look at the 
<a href="http://www.ceasefirecampaign.org/">Ceasefire Now petition</a> and
consider signing it.
<i>[Update: Thank you world!  I have a mailbox full of people saying things
like “wanted to inject a positive note into what’s probably a flood of hate”;
and not one warmonger.  I’m truly moved, and who knows, maybe there’s
hope.]</i></p> 
<h2 id='p-2'>Breaking the Truce</h2>
<p>That Israeli document paints a picture of an armed truce that had been
holding pretty well since May of 2000.  The number of
incidents was 2 in 2000, 2 in 2001, 2 in 2002, 4 in 2003, 3 in 2004,
5 in 2005, and one in 2006 before it all blew up.  (Check out April 2005, when
the Hez kidnapped two northern Israeli Arabs to shake them down for for
intelligence; what lovable guys).</p>
<p>Clearly somebody in Israel thinks the current situation is an improvement;
Lebanon’s infrastructure ripped up,
hundreds of civilians dead, hundreds of
thousands of refugees in motion, and hundreds of Hez rockets over the border
every day.</p>
<p>Weirdly, Israel seems to prefer hereditary dictatorships to emerging
democracies on their borders.</p>
<p>This all seems insane to me, but draw your own
conclusions.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>On Killing Civilians, and Hiding Among Them</h2>
<p>I got an astounding amount of pushback on my
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/07/22/Lebanon-Roundup">it’s wrong to kill
civilians</a> post, all of it saying more or less exactly the same thing: “No,
it’s sad-but-necessary to kill them because Hezbollah is hiding among them.”
This point of view is not obviously insane; if an armed man were about to kill
me and I couldn’t stop him without taking down an innocent bystander too,
well, I just might do it.
But let’s be reasonable, please: killing them by the hundreds to get dozens of
your enemy is barbaric, pure and simple.
And flattening whole suburbs in an unsuccessful attempt to kill enemy leaders is
worse.</p>
<p>That hiding-among-civilians issue has more nuance than you might think.  In
Salon,
<a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2006/07/28/hezbollah/">The "hiding
among civilians" myth</a> offers solid evidence that in fact Hezbollah does
<em>not</em> do this down south where the fighting is hottest.  On the other
hand, 
<a href="http://www.michaeltotten.com/archives/001212.html">there is
evidence</a> (albeit somewhat shaky)
that Hez <em>has</em> been launching
attacks from inside <em>Christian</em> villages.  Which makes a kind of
perverted sense, since those gangs are often blood enemies.  Once again, draw
your own conclusions.</p>
<p>Once again:  <em>Military violence against civilians is
wrong</em>, and if you have
an argument that convinces you it’s right, your argument is broken.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Worthy of Contempt</h2>
<p>I’m having a persistent anger-management problem; seeing your former home
blown to hell with malice aforethought will do that.  So, who am I mad
at?
Oddly, I’m not that mad at the foot soldiers on either side, the IDF or the
Hez.  It’s depressingly easy to get young men to go out and kill and die for
reasons that turn out later to have been really crappy.
The IDF grunts’ leaders tell them that doing this will make the rockets stop
and bring peace to Israel’s northern border, and I’m sure a lot of them are
going about their bloody business as conscientiously as they possibly
can.  The Hez grunts are mostly poor, oppressed, ignorant, and
religion-befuddled, and their leaders tell them that doing this will punish
violent oppressors and do God’s will.</p>
<p>Those leaders, though... anyone who’s read first-hand reportage about the
Hez leadership knows they’re bloodthirsty racist fundamentalist barbarians who
would really like to kill all the Jews and revert the world to
fourteenth-century ways.  Scum.</p>
<p>As for the Israeli political leadership, we have to act on the assumption
that they actually kind of understand what’s going on around them, and that
they launched this in full knowledge that they intended to kill hundreds,
displace hundreds of thousands, and break a country.  And there’s a sickening
suspicion that they knew it wouldn’t work, that this is all playing to the
domestic political theater; which would be getting into Milošević territory.
Scum.</p>
<p>But right at the moment, there’s another group that I’m even angrier at.
These are the individuals right here in the civilized world who are egging on
one side or the other, who show up in blog comments and on talk radio and in some
newspaper columns,
explaining how it’s OK for one side to lob rockets into cities, or for the
other to blow up towns with everyone in them, because the other side deserves
what it’s getting; the victims are kind of sub-human, or are paying a fair
price for something they did in 2001 or 1987 or
1973 or 1967 or 1949 or a couple of millennia before that.</p>
<p>Their position, basically, is “Let’s you and him fight”.  Yep, they’re
willing to fight to the last screaming bleeding victim, as long as it’s a
couple of continents away from their comfy chair.  Some more of them will
write me after I publish this.  They’re not just scum, they’re cowards.</p>

<title>More Ubuntu</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Just a scratchpad for my further Ubuntu-experience notes.
So far: “locate”, Emacs, Thunderbird, Firefox, function keys, windows
vs. apps, menu placement, hibernate, and X keyboard mappings.</p>
<p>The Sun keyboard I’m using on the Ultra 20 is good, but it’s got this
little teeny “Alt” key that’s hard to reach, and this great big dorky
“Diamond” key next to the space-bar, that I want to be Alt.  Here is the
appropriate <code>xmodmap(1)</code> invocation:</p>
<pre><code>keysym Super_L = Alt_L
remove mod4 = Alt_L</code></pre>
<p>Hibernate works solidly but looks shaky.  On the way down, I get plaintive
whines about “soft CPU lockup” problems, and on the way up, I get some serious
screen derangement, plus an occasional complaint that “HAL hibernation
failed”.  OK, I prefer my hardware concrete anyhow.</p>
<p>Three days in, it is <em>so</em> obvious that OS X menu placement (one menu
space, the same position for all apps) is right, and all other options are
wrong.  I suppose Apple’s patented it?</p>
<p>It’s only taken me a day or two to decide that the Windows/Gnome view that
a window is a window is a window, and alt-tab works at a window at a time, and
you don’t have to bear in mind the difference between an app an a window, is
<em>right</em>, and OS X is wrong about this.</p>
<p>Wow!  I’d forgotten about <code>locate(1)</code>; it’s here and it Just
Works and boy, is it ever faster than Spotlight.</p>
<p>Grmph.  My mousewheel doesn’t work in Emacs.  And you have to do some
voodoo to get cut-&amp;-paste working:<br/>
<code>(setq x-select-enable-clipboard 't)</code><br/>
Plus, it doesn’t have an icon in the taskbar.  In fact, I’m beginning to
think that Emacs is generally one of Ubuntu’s weaker links.
<i>[Update: 
<a href="http://diveintomark.org/">Mark Pilgrim</a> writes to point me at
emacs-snapshot-gtk, which is a bit more polished, and ispell works.]</i></p>
<p>Thunderbird’s spam filter is remarkably good these days, and learns fast.
A couple of steps ahead of Mail.app, I’d say.
Its search function is immensely less irritating, too (I fart in Spotlight’s
general direction).
Unfortunately, the Emacs keystrokes, which work more or less everywhere on OS
X, aren’t there.
<i>[Update: Jay Carlson writes with pointer to
<a href="http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-gnome/2004-November/008967.html">a
how-to</a>.]</i></p>
<p>Firefox doesn’t have a setting to go to your home page in a new 
tab.  <i>[Update: Richard Cohen points out that a middle-click on the “Home”
icon does the job.]</i></p>
<p>Working on a nice big desktop keyboard and not having to fight OS X for use
of the function keys is a nice change.</p>

<title>Stiff’s Questions</title>

<body>
<p>A while ago I got an email out of the blue from 
Jarosław Rzeszótko, who’s from Poland I think,
saying “I hope you don’t mind if I ask you a few questions
about software.”  Then I ran across it again while looking for something in my
inbox on a plane ride, so I dashed off some answers; the person seemed
pleasant and polite.
He calls himself “Stiff” and his blog
“Sztywny Blog”.  Anyhow, he also heard back from Linus Torvalds, Dave
Thomas, David Heinemeier Hansson, Steve Yegge, Peter Norvig, Guido van Rossum,
and James Gosling.
<a href="http://sztywny.titaniumhosting.com/2006/07/23/stiff-asks-great-programmers-answers/">The answers</a>

<title>On Names</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The W3C 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/">Technical Architecture Group</a>, on
which I had the
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/Web/TAG/">honour to serve</a> for a couple
of years, is working on a document called
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/URNsAndRegistries-50.html">URNs,
Namespaces, and Registries</a>.  Norm Walsh, longtime TAG member, has written
a
<a href="http://norman.walsh.name/2006/07/25/namesAndAddresses">human-readable version</a>,
and I recommend it.
The question of how to name things is persistently one of the hardest in
Computer Science, and one of the reasons the Web succeeds is that it does a
pretty good job, using URIs.  
If you’re thinking “Doesn’t he really mean URL?”, check out 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/02/27/URL">The Universal Republic of
Love</a>).
However, every so often a group of people says “Hey, URIs beginning with
<code>http:</code> are addresses, not names, and we need names, persistent
names, so we’ll invent a new URI scheme.”  They are nearly always wrong;
it takes a whole lot of thinking about the notions of names and addresses to
achieve clarity, and wanting a new URI scheme is usually evidence that you
haven’t.  I’ve tried to explain this dozens of times, but I think Norm does a
better job than I ever have.</p>

<title>Ubuntu Gimp Intelligence</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Well, I was going to have to do it sometime.  I got out the USB cable and
plugged the camera into the Ubuntu box, not expecting much.</p>
<p>What a pleasant surprise; some little program popped up, told me I’d
plugged in a Canon S70 and wondered where I’d like to download the pictures
to.  Had a nice little slide-show thingie too for quick review.  It doesn’t
seem to preserve the names the camera gave the pictures; a pity.
<i>[Update:
<a href="http://www.figuiere.net/hub/blog/">Hubert Figuiere</a>, maintainer of
<a href="http://gphoto.org">gPhoto2</a>, wrote to point me at the “Preserve

Gphoto seems excellent!]</i></p>
<p>Then it was time to break out the Gimp.</p>
<img src="00014.jpg" alt="Street scene, two signs say ‘intelligence’" />
<div class="caption"><p>Shot through a car window, and it shows.
Signs like this are common in Vancouver, and they
point the way to a movie shoot.  I assume they’re shooting a sequel to 
<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0479593/">this</a>.</p></div>
<p>The Gimp.  Well, I think I could learn to live with it, you know?
I haven’t figured out how to resize a rectangular selection, but everything
else I needed to do pretty well just worked.  Sure is amazingly like
PhotoShop, isn’t it?  Except for I’ve been using Elements, not full PhotoShop,
and Elements doesn’t have a Curves control, but the Gimp does, which is kind
of nice.
Levels and curves don’t preview in real-time, but that hurts less than you’d
think.  And if you’re wondering how much rotating you need to do, there’s a
“Measure Distances and Angles” tool.</p>
<p>And then there’s performance: the Gimp on a 2.6GHz Sun Ultra 20 stomps
all over Elements on the PowerBook.</p>

then we walked over the Steel Bridge to the conference.  We were worried about

<p>You can see how it works; whatever it is that this thing processes gets
stored in those big silo-like

An agricultural product, I bet.</p>
<p>People work, have offices I suppose, up above the silos there; see the
windows and doors?</p>

‘elevated’ and weighed before being sent on conveyor belts to the silos. The
area on top of the silos houses a network of conveyors that move the grain
about at speeds in excess of 40 mph (grain has to be kept from becoming damp
and compacted by moving it between silos every few days).  The windows are
needed to vent the conveyor area as the grain dust is kicked up by the
conveyors and becomes explosive, a fuel-air explosion (dust from Soya beans is
45x more explosive than TNT). </p>

<title>Java.net Terms of Use</title>

<body>
<p>Sometimes we make progress.  Way last year, I got email from
<a href="http://norbertlindenberg.com/">Norbert Lindenberg</a>, grousing about
the Terms of Use on Java.net; they were full of scary language about how you
and your employer had to indemnify Sun and “its business partners” against
anything bad that might happen with any connection to anything you did, and
about how you were signing up for the similarly-scary sun.com terms of use.
So I went poking around and asked the Java.net people why they sounded
unfriendly, and they said, “Hmm, let’s talk to the lawyers”, who said,
more or less, “If there are good business reasons to relax this a
little, well OK then.”
It turns out we’re partnering on this stuff with O’Reilly and CollabNet, so
there were a lot of moving parts involved; a whole bunch of people had to
pitch in.  I didn’t do much of the work, so I may have this wrong, but from
where I sit it looks like 
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/marla">Marla Parker</a> and

Anyhow, as of yesterday, things are better.

the smile occasionally veers out of control into a lopsided inebriated

<p>I’ve been having fun writing Ruby (and I’ll post some thoughts on that, and
the code, soon) and one of the things I’m trying to do is be idiomatic.  I
haven’t fully internalized where to use parentheses and where not to; but I’ve
come to appreciate the virtues of leaving them out; 
one of the reasons that Ruby’s so easy to read is that there are fewer
typographic squiggles to break up the flow of meaningful text.  Also,
having done mostly Java for some time, I use
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase">lowerCamelCase</a> method
names.  But after some days soaking in the Ruby ethos, those names are

<title>On Carr</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>You know, I’ve really had trouble figuring out
<a href="http://www.roughtype.com/index.php">Nick Carr</a>.
I’m a confirmed subscriber, because a lot of his writing is excellent; but
then, some of it
seems to come from troll territory.  I have a theory; and some words on Open
Source.
<i>[Update: Carr
<a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2006/08/ongoing.php">responds at length</a>.]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Good and the Bad</h2>
<p>He regularly writes thoughtful, penetrating pieces, for example on
<a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2005/12/buying_eyes.php">the online
ad market</a> or
<a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2005/11/hypermediation.php">Hypermediation</a>
or
<a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2005/10/shock_treatment.php">IT economics</a>;
carefully argued and thought-provoking even where I’m unconvinced.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he also fires broadsides that feel at best half-baked,
about how businesses shouldn’t allow blogging and Wikipedia is lame
and Open Source isn’t about communities any more.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>The Explanation</h2>
<p>I think I see a theme: Carr seems to be arguing that
<em>there’s nothing new in the world</em>.  Blogging?  Let’s have some
old-fashioned discipline.  Wikipedia?  Open Source?
Conventional command and control, move right along, nothing new to see here.
Obviously, I disagree: The steady migration of knowledge onto
the Net is a new thing, qualitatively.   And, in the last few years,
the phenomenon of millions of people becoming contributors, not just
consumers, is a big deal and I don’t think anyone really understands it.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Open Source</h2>
<p>Anyhow, the reason I started writing this was to push back on Carr’s recent
<a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2006/08/open_source_as.php">Open
Source as a metaphor</a>, which builds from the observation that successful
OSS projects attract financial support and have formal governance,
proceeding to the familiar “Nothing really new here”
conclusion.  
I think Carr’s problem is that he doesn’t actually see Open-Source people in
their natural habitats; he was at
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/02/16/OSBC">OSBC</a> but not
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/07/29/OSCON-overview">OSCON</a>.
The practice of OSS software has two drivers that matter: the community of
peers, and the urge to scratch a technical itch.  If you don’t understand
that, you’ll never understand anything important about OSS.  I’ve been sitting
in front of this excellent Ubuntu box for a week now, and I look at the
<a href="http://www.gphoto.org/">digicam framework</a> and
<a href="http://gaim.sourceforge.net/">chat client</a> and
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">text editor</a> and
<a href="http://www.nongnu.org/synaptic/">package manager</a> and
<a href="http://www.gimp.org/">photo editor</a> and literally
<em>hundreds</em> of other offerings that make this thing go, and I shake my
head in wonder at the notion that anyone could see this as a product of
Business As Usual.</p>

<h2 id='p-1'>SFU</h2>
<p>That stands for Stir-Fry Unit, and we’ll use it for all the ingredients in

matter that much.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Marinade</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Soya sauce, 1SFU</p></li>
<li><p>Toasted sesame oil, 1SFU</p></li>
<li><p>Pressed garlic, 1 <em>generous</em> SFU</p></li>
<li><p>Apple cider vinegar, 1SFU</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-3'>To Fry</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Steak, 1SFU</p></li>
<li><p>Broccoli, 1SFU</p></li>
<li><p>Green beans, 1SFU</p></li>
<li><p>Ordinary white supermarket mushrooms, 1SFU</p></li>
<li><p>Red pepper (note for the Aussies: I mean capsicum), 1SFU</p></li>
<li><p>White onions, 1SFU</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-4'>Procedure</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Cut the steak in thin strips, marinate it for one temporal SFU.</p></li>
<li><p>Chop the pepper/capsicum, and toss it in the hot wok with no oil; stir
it around a bit until it’s 
got black burn marks here and there.  Take it out and set it aside.</p></li>
<li><p>Chop the next ingredient while the pepper’s cooking, you have to
interleave the chopping and frying.</p></li>
<li><p>Take the meat out of the marinade (some will come with it, that’s OK)
and stir-fry it.  Set it aside; there’ll be a little marinade left in the
wok.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a little oil to the wok and stir-fry the onions until they’re
getting soft.</p></li>
<li><p>Toss in the rest of the chopped veggies on top of the onions, maybe a
little more oil, stir-fry.  Sprinkle liberally with teriyaki sauce.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the meat and burned peppers back in for the last 60 seconds or so
of frying.</p></li> 
</ol>
<p>This sounds complicated but I don’t think setting up the marinade took
Lauren more than 15 minutes and I know I had dinner on the table 20 minutes
after I walked into the kitchen.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Serving</h2>
<p>Goes well with Basmati rice and a low-malt high-hop beer in the Pilsener
style.</p>

<p>I thought the laugh line “Object-Relational Mapping is the Vietnam of
Computer Science” was ancient, but Ted Neward claims that he made it up in
2004.  Ted has written an immense, detailed, essay on the subject,
<a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2006/06/26/The+Vietnam+Of+Computer+Science.aspx">The
Vietnam of Computer Science</a>, which, just to be thorough, includes a
capsule history of the Vietnam conflict.
This ought to be required reading for all Computer Science undergrads, so
they’ll at least be forewarned before they stumble into their own private
Southeast Asia.

<title>The Ape</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’ve put up an Atom Protocol Exerciser at 
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ape/">www.tbray.org/ape</a>.  
It might evolve to become a sanity-checking tool something along
the lines of the <a href="http://feedvalidator.org">Feed Validator</a>.
I don’t want to call it a “validator” because a feed can be said unambiguously
to be valid, or not; but a publishing-system interface might be unusably buggy
or slow or have moronic authentication policies; all the Exerciser (let’s just
say “the Ape” for short) does is perform a bunch of operations that a typical
APP client might, and report the results.  Also I’ve taken liberties in
reporting some things that aren’t covered by the spec that implementors might
want to know about.  
One of the most useful things the Ape does is provide a complete trace of
exactly what the client and server sent back and forth to each other;
immensely helpful as a debugging aid.
Quite a few
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/17/JRuby">interesting war stories</a> have
been coming out of the Ape-building process.  I’ll keep this post updated with the current
Ape status.
<i>[Latest: i18n is back, and Elias Torres has a guinea-pig APP end-point to
try it out on.]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-1'>How Can You Try It?</h2>
<p>Best of all, use your own nascent Atom-Protocol server.  In the interim,
Elias Torres has 
<a href="http://torrez.us/archives/2006/08/21/486/">wired up APP to
WordPress</a> (see also
<a href="http://torrez.us/archives/2006/08/23/487/">here</a>),
and graciously invited the world to
test his; the URI is <code>http://torrez.us/code/wp-app/demo/app.php</code>,
while the username and password are both <code>demo</code>.
Plug in those values and watch the Ape expose some minor problems and give you
a nice readout of the client/server traffic.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>How Can You Help?</h2>
<p>This has been tested on quite a collection of APP endpoints, but it’s still
young, and there’s a chance that users will be debugging the Ape at the same time as their own
implementation.  So if the Ape goes weird or is accusing you of a bug you
don’t think you have, it’s likely not your problem; let me know.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve got the basic framework down, it’s pretty easy to add tests.
So please suggest APP tests.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>What Does It Do?</h2>
<p>The Ape has one required argument, the service document URI.  Optionally,
you can provide a username/password pair (Basic and Basic+TLS work at the moment)
and the names of collections you want Ape to use for
posting new entries and media files.
Here’s what the Ape does:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Retrieves the Service doc, verifies that it can be fetched and is
served as <code>application/atomserv+xml</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Verifies that it’s well-formed.</p></li>
<li><p><s>Validates it against the non-normative RNC schema from the
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-atompub-protocol-09.txt">protocol-09</a>
Working Group draft</s>.  Removed until I go back to JRuby or port
<a href="http://www.davidashen.net/rnv.html">RNV</a> or
something.</p></li>
<li><p>Lists the collections found in the service document, and the value of
each one’s <code>accept</code> field.</p></li>
<li><p>Finds a collection to use in posting test entries; if no name is
provided, picks the first.</p></li>
<li><p>Finds a collection that will accept <code>image/jpeg</code> postings;
if no media-collection argument is provided, it picks the first available one
that matches.</p></li>
<li><p>Retrieves the entries collection, makes sure it’s served as
<code>application/atom+xml</code>, that it’s well-formed, <s>and that it
validates against the 
<a href="http://atompub.org/2005/08/17/atom.rnc">non-normative Atom schema</a>
from RFC4287</s>.</p></li>
<li><p>Lists the entries currently found in the entries collection.</p></li>
<li><p>Posts a new entry to the entries collection, and reports on the success
of the POST operation and the entry’s server-assigned location.</p></li>
<li><p>Verifies that the URI in the Location header in the Post response can
be dereferenced to produce an Atom Entry that is consistent with that posted.</p></li>
<li><p>If the entry-creation POST sends back a body, checks whether its title,
summary, and content are the same as that posted.
The entry’s title is “From the &lt;APE> (サル)”.</p></li>
<li><p>Re-fetches the entries feed, verifies that the new entry’s ID shows up
there, and that the version in the feed has the same title, summary, and
content.</p></li>
<li><p>Reports whether foreign markup (the posted entry has a
<code>dc:subject</code> child) is 
preserved in the online version.</p></li>
<li><p>Checks whether the online version has a <code>link@[rel=edit]</code>
URI.</p></li>
<li><p>PUTs a modified version of the entry to the edit URI.</p></li>
<li><p>Re-fetches the entries feed to verify that the update is reflected in
the entry.</p></li>
<li><p>Deletes the entry and reports the success of the DELETE
operation.</p></li>
<li><p>Re-fetches the entries feed to check that the deleted entry is no
longer there.</p></li>
<li><p>If there’s no collection that accepts <code>image/jpeg</code>, that’s
all.
Otherwise, posts a small picture with a <code>Title</code> header saying
“Picture of the APE” and reports on the success of the POST
operation.</p></li>
<li><p>Verifies that there’s an appropriately-served media link entry at the
URI returned in the Location header.</p></li>
<li><p>Verifies that the image can be retrieved as posted from the URI
specified in the <code>src</code> attribute of the media link entry’s
<a href="code">content</a> element.</p></li>
<li><p>Deletes the media link entry and reports on the success of the DELETE
operation.</p></li>
<li><p>Re-fetches the media feed and checks that the media link entry no
longer appears.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id='p-4'>To-Do</h2>
<p>Please add to this section!</p>
<ul>
<li><p><s>Internationalization sanity-check; this was actually in an earlier
version but fell by the wayside while chasing a JRuby bug, should be easy to
add back in.</s></p></li>
<li><p><s>Media resources and media link entries.</s></p></li>
<li><p>Authentication options beyond Basic+TLS.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to change an entry ID with a PUT, and report the results.</p></li>
<li><p>Release the source code so you can run this locally against your own
engine without having to use my website.</p></li>
<li><p><s>Improve the diagnostics.  For example, the posted summary might differ
from the one in the feed because there isn’t any in the feed, or because it’s
been converted from whatever you sent to <code>type="html"</code></s>.  
Added a complete readout of the client/server dialog.</p></li>
<li><p>Pretty up the ugly web-site.  Anyone know of an appealing royalty-free
picture of an ape grooming another?</p></li>
<li><p>Categories.</p></li>
<li><p>Make the changes that fall out of the imminent protocol-10 APP draft.</p></li>

<title>Economist Trouble</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I am a long-time reader of
<a href="http://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a>; I give subscriptions
to several of my loved ones every Christmas, and regard it as the
most compact and efficient way to be reasonably well informed about the
world’s realities.  One has to route around their reflexive 
ideological filter (“Well, maybe child labour isn’t that bad if the market wants
it”), but still, the quality of writing and thinking is generally very good.
In the last couple of years, though, there’s been a slow steady trickle of horrid
editorial lapses; some things can apparently 
make it onto the page without having passed through an intelligent person’s
mind. This worries me, since I’d find it hard to replace if it went bad.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>AEI</h2>
<p>Last year, in a discussion of the Bush administration’s failed
attempt to privatize Social Security, the question arose of whether people
would learn to manage their own savings.  <cite>The Economist</cite> quoted an
analyst from the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Enterprise_Institute">American
Enterprise Institute</a> saying “No problem, they’ll learn.”  Huh?  The AEI
is a primary architect of the Bush administration’s policies.  You
might as well ask Opus Dei about the Pope’s latest pronouncement.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Dell</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, in a discussion of Dell’s recent poor business
performance, they went on and on about the kinds of computers they’re building
and the markets they’re addressing, and somehow neglected to say a single word
about Dell’s hideous technical-support problems, and the fact that they’ve
made their formerly-great Web site hard to use.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>It’s</h2>
<p>Twice in the last year, they’ve had “it’s” where they meant
“its”.  Gimme a break, “its” and “it’s” are like “his” and “he’s” and that’s
all you need to know; but apparently <cite>The Economist</cite> lets its pages
go to press without basic literacy review?</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Women</h2>
<p>In the almost-current August 5-11 issue, there’s an interesting
and intelligent article,
<a href="http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=7245949">The
mismeasure of woman</a>, about 
the study of genetically-driven differences in the male and
female minds.  But at the front of the magazine was 
a shorter leader,
<a href="http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_SNVNRRS">How
women won the sex war</a>, which was witty and amusing, then the last
paragraph said “Wise chaps seeking professional advancement should therefore
spend their free time with groups of women, boning up on how to undermine
somebody's confidence while pretending to boost it, and how to turn an entire
lunch table against an absent colleague without saying a mean word.”  
Excuse me, are there any grown-up editors or is it just a bunch of
sniggering throwbacks?</p>

<title>Announcing</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Today, we
<a href="http://www.sun.com/launch/2006-0815/index.jsp">announced</a> some
faster servers; I’m not a big-SPARC guy so the one that makes my heart go
pitter-pat is the
<a href="http://www.sun.com/desktop/workstation/ultra20/?intcmp=lnch08_u20_overview">new
Ultra</a>; I just spent a week living on a year-old Ultra and while it’s damn
fast, I managed to make it breathe hard with both JRuby and the Gimp.
What’s more interesting is the
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan?entry=putting_a_chill_on_the">PG&amp;E
rebate</a>.  Check it out, but what’s even more interesting,
to me, is that there are three ways you can read about it:
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan?entry=putting_a_chill_on_the">Jonathan’s blog</a>,
the
<a href="http://www.sun.com/emrkt/energy-rebate/">Sun.com page</a>, and
the
<a href="http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2006-08/sunflash.20060815.2.xml">official
press release</a>.  
The blog is the most interesting, with the Craigslist reference and and the
highway-rules context.  If you want details, the Sun.com page is OK, with some
sample calculations and so on.
Which leaves the press release.  It seems to have been carefully designed for
unreadability, its meandering sentences studded with company chest-pounding
and its stilted, committee-compromise quotes (even those from smart, genuine
people like 
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/enviro">Dave Douglas</a>) that no
human voice would ever utter.
Having said that, the press release contains some useful facts that aren’t in
either Jonathan’s write-up or the Sun.com page.
We (the world I mean) need to do marketing better.

<title>Back to the Mac</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>It took nearly two weeks to get the PowerBook fixed, but for now I’m a
Macboy again.  On balance, the Mac experience is better.  But Ubuntu is not
that far behind, and it’s catching up.  I’m thinking about the endgame.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Where OS X Wins</h2>
<p>The single biggest quality-of-life delta, weirdly, was the control keys.
On Mac, it’s command-C for cut and command-V for paste.  On Linux it’s
Control-C and Control-V, except when it’s not, which is in a terminal window
and Emacs, which is where I spend a whole bunch of my time.  
OK, a small irritant, but one that bites <em>all the time</em>.</p>
<p>Then there are the fonts.  Anti-aliasing is an optional extra on Linux, and
I wasn’t willing to do the <code>sources.list</code> wrangling to
get the bleeding-edge allegedly-anti-aliased Emacs.  Also, lots of fonts
Windows &amp; Mac people use every day just aren’t there on Linux.
There are apparently some gyrations and downloads and things you can do to
get some of them.</p>
<p>I couldn’t get Flash working (complaints about the amd64 architecture),
which meant lots of irritating little holes in Web pages everywhere.  Not
being able to watch YouTube is a real time-saver, though.</p>
<p>And of course, OS X’s single-menubar-across-the-top is Right, other options
are Wrong.</p>
<p>Photoshop Elements has special controls to make it real easy to create 4x6
and 5x7 prints of babies for grandmothers.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Where Ubuntu Wins</h2>
<p>You don’t have to think, when you’re Alt-tabbing, about applications
vs. windows.</p> 
<p>You don’t have to worry about Fink vs. DarwinPorts vs. build-from-source,
everything you’ll ever need is in a package and ready to go.</p>
<p>Linux is a little better at poking around SMB space, finding and connecting
to Windows servers.</p>
<p>The Gimp has a Curves control, which you have to spend a thousand bucks to
get from full-bore Photoshop.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Next Steps: Applications</h2>
<p>I have so had it with Apple applications.  A couple weeks with Thunderbird
made it obvious I should have long since dumped Mail.app.
Every week iCal gets
slower and every week I hate it more.  When I was on Ubuntu, I maintained
my schedule by typing it into a plain-text document in Emacs, and that was
so much less painful.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Next Steps: Operating Systems</h2>
<p>Once I get myself working in an application suite that’s entirely free from
data lock-in, which in effect means all-OSS, then the choice of operating
system and hardware becomes independent of the apps I use.</p>
<p>Right now, oversimplifying egregiously, you might classify the 
Unix-like operating systems like so:</p>
<ul><li><p>OS X is the winner for suspend/resume, wireless networking,
typography, and outboard screen handling.</p></li>
<li><p>Solaris is the winner for observability, virtualization, and big-iron
threading.</p></li>
<li><p>Linux (Debian &amp; friends anyhow) is the winner for package
management and running on an infinite variety of different hardware.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from that, I’d say it’s pretty well a wash.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>My Next Computer Will Be...</h2>
<p>Well, I don’t know.  Weirdly, now that I’ve realized that I can have a
decent application suite that doesn’t lock up my data and runs on whatever
OS/Hardware, my desire to get off the Mac has moderated.  On the other hand,
if, next time I go shopping, a real good reason to go with Solaris or Linux
instead comes along, I’ll do it without much angst.  And I’ll put in the time then to go
score those fonts and that anti-aliasing code and switch from Gnome to KDE and
so on and so forth.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Oh Yes, Video</h2>
<p>First, it’s dorky to try to pretend that a laptop, any laptop, is an
appropriate device for video editing.  Second, right now, near as I can tell,
the Mac software in this space is just a whole lot better.  So I think that
my future probably has a dedicated Mac video-editing box in it.  And if
that’s the only Mac I end up using, well whatever.</p>

<a href="http://www.juancole.com/2006/08/vl-day-patrick-mcgreevy-writes-from.html">letter

We owe sympathy to the victims on both sides.  And I can’t help feeling some

the other living in caves and getting hammered by the best modern Western
military technology.

<title>The Ruby Ape Diaries</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I took tons of notes while I was working on the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/11/Meet-the-Ape">Ape</a>.
I was going to hold off publishing till I released the code, 
but once I actually launched the formal Sun process to do that, I discovered
that it can take two or three weeks, and so I decided to
go ahead while it was fresh in my mind.
Unfortunately, the piece pretty soon had fifteen different sections and would have been
too long for mere mortals with jobs to read, and furthermore, the sections
didn’t have much to do with each other, and there just aren’t that many people
on earth who’d be interested in all of them.
Some of them look close at the issues of making Java and Ruby get along, while
others wallow in duck-typing perversity and finer points of Ruby style.
So I’ll keep them short and do one a day (or so) for the next week
(or so) and fill a table of contents in here.

<title>RAD I: Why JRuby?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>[RAD stands for
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/17/JRuby">Ruby Ape Diaries</a>, of which
this is part I.]
To build a validator you need an HTTP engine and an XML parser, both of which
Ruby is advertised as having.
<a href="http://www.jruby.org/">JRuby</a>, when I first took this on, was as
at release 0.9.0 and had plenty of rough edges.  But I decided to use it
anyhow.</p>
<p>The Ape needs to check that various protocol messages are
well-formed XML, and to validate them against the RelaxNG schemas for
Atom and the Atom Protocol.
Ruby’s built-in XML engine, 
<a href="http://www.germane-software.com/software/rexml/">JREXML</a>,
has a casual attitude towards correctness.  The pretty-good
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/rubyckbk/">Ruby Cookbook</a> offers
this example:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;groceries>
 &lt;bread>Wheat</code></pre>
<p>The cookbook airily claims that the fragment above “is unambiguous, which
means REXML can parse it”.  This should be re-written to say that the fragment
above “is malformed, which means REXML is egregiously broken”.
There are some things to like (and dislike; more later) about REXML, but it’s
really not an appropriate choice for a validator.</p>
<p>I poked around, and there are various bits of guerilla code you can get
that link Ruby up to
<a href="http://xmlsoft.org/">Libxml2</a> or
<a href="http://expat.sourceforge.net/">Expat</a>, with various degrees of
cooked-ness, and their own APIs.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Java comes with a solid XML parser and standard APIs
built-in.  Also, the only general-purpose RelaxNG validator I knew of is 
<a href="http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/jing.html">Jing</a>, built in
Java.</p>
<p>Also, under my Sun hat, I’ve been promoting the notion of other languages
on the Java platform, but &lt;blush> I’ve never actually written any serious
code in any of ’em, so this was a chance.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Bad Stuff</h2>
<p>In the big picture, performance should be a non-issue.  The Ape does
trivial little bits of computing in between its exchanges of messages with an
HTTP server out there; once you get JRuby in production in some sort of
servlet container, I’d be astounded if you could measure the difference
between JRuby and hand-crafted C.</p>
<p>But while I’m debugging it I’m eating the startup delay all the time, and
at the moment, it’s brutal; I mean seriously bad.
The JRuby guys have been doing some pretty bold chest-beating about how fast
JRuby’s gonna be—bolder than I’d be in their position—but at the moment it’s
kind of sucky to develop in.</p>
<p>I’m not going to complain too much about the fact that JRuby still has bugs
(hey, I reported
<a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-65">#65</a>,
<a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-66">#66</a>, and
<a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-94">#94</a>).
Because things, by and large, Just Work until you start to rub up against the
edges.</p>
<p>I was a little irritated by the fact that it’s too easy to produce
a traceback that combines a handful of lines of Ruby stack with <em>a couple
of hundred</em> lines of Java stack.</p>
<p>There is clearly a psychological gap between the Java Way of doing things
and the Ruby way, and it leads to some really weird-looking
Ruby code, but I don’t think it’s actually a problem.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Good</h2>
<p>Yep, if it’s out there in the vast echoing universe of Java APIs, you can
get to it from JRuby.
You can do things you wouldn’t expect, like subclass Java interfaces (!) and
refer to getters and setters with Ruby idioms; by some magic
<code>foo.setBar()</code> is also known as <code>foo.bar=</code>.</p>
<p>Here’s an example: I have a little class that bridges to Jing, it loads a Relax
schema and validates arbitrary chunks of XML.  The
<a href="http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/api/jing/">Jing API</a> is <em>not</em>
built for comfort, it definitely has that factory factory factory
feel.  But the glue class is only 36 lines of Ruby, 9 of which are Java includes, and
has never caused any trouble; this includes setting up a
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/io/StringWriter.html">StringWriter</a> to collect error messages and so on.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Surprises</h2>
<p>First of all, I’ve been writing XML processing code longer than any other
human being, but I’ve always been a lean, mean, stream-parser guy; I’d
never been near the standard DOM.  Well, blecch.  Yes, I understand why it
is the way it is, but it sure isn’t fun.  If I were doing this again I’d look
hard at JDOM or XOM or something else instead.  But anyhow, I got it to
work.</p>
<p>I also had managed to forget how lame Jing’s error messages are.
It usually doesn’t tell you much more than “Missing element.  Bye.”
I’d like to use the 
<a href="http://feedvalidator.org">Feed Validator</a> code, which is in
Python, hmmm...</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>More To Come</h2>
<p>There’s lots more to write about here at the Ruby/Java coalface; 
interfaces and constants and glue code and coding conventions and so on.  Keep
reading the diaries.</p>

<title>RAD II: Back to Ruby</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>[RAD stands for
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/17/JRuby">Ruby Ape Diaries</a>, of which
this is part II.]
As of today the Ape is on Ruby, not JRuby; read on for the sad story and the
Ape’s address.</p>
<p>Today I was going to test against my first APP end-point that claimed
to offer proper TLS authentication, and I hit a brick wall, because JRuby
doesn’t have that yet, and won’t for a while.</p>
<p>So I moaned and started switching back to Ruby.  First, I chopped out the Jing
validation (which I could, and may, revive with an external
call).  Also, the Ape now rests shakily on REXML’s parsing prowess.</p>
<p>Amazingly, the whole process took less than an
hour.  I’d put together a glue class called JREXML to stand in for Ruby’s
REXML, and had got the API subtly wrong in a couple of places.
Once that was working, it was gratifying that all the XPaths worked the same
in Javaland and REXML.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the startup-time problem is gone, and I guess I can tell the world
where the Ape lives:
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ape">www.tbray.org/ape</a>.
It’s still a CGI and I may have to shut it down if abuse happens.
If anyone wants to volunteer an APP end-point for the world to turn the Ape loose
on, the world will be able to check out the Ape’s output.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, the past day or so I’ve focused on capturing the
client/server dialogue and including it in the Ape’s report, and I think it’ll
be a massively helpful debugging aid.</p>
<p>I’ll still report on the JRuby lessons, and when it has TLS I’ll switch
back, because there are some other Java libraries that I’m thinking of.</p>

<title>RAD III: Quack Like a URI</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>[RAD stands for
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/17/JRuby">Ruby Ape Diaries</a>, of which
this is part III.]
This little illustration of a programming idiom is solely designed to horrify
newcomers from the Java world, and will look mundane to existing Rubyists.
Problem: I want to check a URI to make sure it’s appropriate for use in the
Atom Protocol, and if not, report a coherent error message</p>
<p>The problem is, for network operations I don’t want the Ape chasing off
after anything but <code>http:</code> and <code>https:</code> URIs.  For
identifiers, you can use all the <code>tag:</code> and <code>urn:</code> 
URIs you want.  But for
GETting and POSTing and PUTting and and DELETEing, <code>http</code> is what
you want.  You never know, some black-hat might try to convince the Ape to
follow a <code>file:</code> pointer.</p>
<p>So there’s this little teeny class called AtomURI with one class method
<code>check</code>.  You give it a string that you claim is a URI and it
either gives you back a URI object, or an error message explaining why it
isn’t suitable.</p>
<p>So, in Java, you could actually create an instance with methods for
checking and retrieving the result and the error message if any.
Alternatively, you could throw an exception if the URI wasn’t kosher (Ruby’s
own <code>URI.parse</code> method does this).</p>
<p>Phooey.  If the URI is OK, my Ruby method returns the URI
object, otherwise it just returns the error message.
So the caller does something like this:</p>
<pre><code>uri = AtomURI.check alleged_uri
if uri.class == String
  # oops
  report_error uri
  return
end
request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri.path)</code></pre>
<p>I’m quite sure that a seasoned Rubyist would have an even more elegant,
idiomatic, and minimal way to do this kind of thing.  But having strong,
dynamic typing changes how you think.</p>
<p>I suppose in Java, you could kind of do the same, just return an Object and
type-check it.   But then you’d have to cast, and furthermore, in Java, That
Would Be Wrong.</p>

<title>RAD IV: TMTOWTDI</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>[RAD stands for
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/17/JRuby">Ruby Ape Diaries</a>, of which
this is part IV.]
That glob of letters in the title stands for “There’s More Than One Way To Do It”, and it
comes from Perl culture.  It is a distinguishing feature of Perl that if
there’s something you need to do, not only does Perl have a way to do it, it 
has lots of different ways.  
Perl’s legion of evangelists, led by Larry Wall, argue that this is an
advantage.
Larry has a compelling argument by parallel with linguistics; natural
languages usually have many ways of saying anything that’s worth saying.
Not everyone agrees that this is a virtue; in particular, Pythonistas have
historically grumbled.  Ruby seems to fall into the Perl camp.  And now,
dear readers, I must confess to a bit of duplicity.  When I wrote
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/19/Ruby-Typing">RAD III: Quack Like a
URI</a>, I knew that my example was perhaps not the purest possible example of
duck typing, but my hidden agenda, namely gathering material for a TMTOWTDI
essay, worked out well.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Ruby on Ruby</h2>
<p>First off the mark was Sam Ruby, with
<a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/08/19/Quack-Squared#comments">Quack
Squared</a>, who argues convincingly for:</p>
<pre><code>uri = AtomURI.check alleged_uri
return report_error(uri) unless uri.methods.include? :path
request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri.path)</code></pre>
<p>But check his comments, where we find six other suggested approaches.
The last is kind of startling:</p>
<pre><code>uri = URI.new_with_app_check(alleged_uri) { |e| return report_error(e) }</code></pre>
<p>I can see where they’re going, but something about it makes me nervous.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Burke on Ruby</h2>
<p>Over at the
<a href="http://blogs.divisibleprime.com/ronin/">ronin</a> blog (cool URI
BTW), Kerry Burke offers another 
<a href="http://blogs.divisibleprime.com/ronin/articles/2006/08/20/ruby-error-checking">elegant suggestion</a>: return two 
values:</p>
<pre><code>def some_method
    return [true, "actual return value here"]
end

ok, value = some_method
return "this didn't work" unless ok
puts value</code></pre>
<h2 id='p-2'>Morel on Ruby</h2>
<p>Xavier Morel, who doesn’t have a blog, wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just read your “Quack like a URI” article, and I had a few things to
tell you about it:</p>
<ul><li><p>First of all, you shouldn’t use the class attribute to check for an
object’s type, Ruby has the #kind_of? method which does the job much
better as it also checks the whole inheritance tree. Let’s imagine
that someone subclasses “String” and that you check for the
Stringiness of the object, checking on #class won’t validate the
user-generated class while #kind_of? will. Plus kind_of? being a
predicate, your intent is much clearer:<br/>
<code>uri.class == String</code><br/>
versus<br/>
<code>uri.kind_of? String</code></p>
<p>Granted, in this case since you’re the one generating the data it
doesn’t matter much, because you’re not subclassing strings.</p></li>
<li><p>Second, this is not duck-typing, duck-typing is testing what an
object is able of, you’re checking for an object’s type. Using
duck-typing would mean using #respond_to? (or just trying to send the
message, and catch the exception), which checks whether or not an
object responds to a message. In this case, you could check whether or
not your response has a path, for example</p>
<pre><code>if uri.respond_to? :path
  request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri.path)
else
  report_error uri
end</code></pre>
<p>But a more Rubyful way might be to use a predicate: check implies that
you’re just checking (for what?), while you’re performing many other
operations besides checking for uri validity (generating a URI object,
or creating an error message). Your code is therefore quite
misleading/surprising, it lacks obviousness.</p>
<p>For example you could do something along the lines of:</p>
<pre><code>if AtomURI::is_valid? alleged_uri
  # do stuff
else
  # error
end</code></pre>
<p>Or even use blocks</p>
<pre><code>AtomURI.if_valid alleged_uri do |uri|
  # do whatever you’re supposed to do with your URI object
end</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I wrote back disagreeing with Xavier’s claim that there was anything
incorrect about my class test; I wrote the <code>atomURI.check</code> method
and I <em>know</em> that what’s coming back is either a URI or a String, and I
absolutely don’t want it  rooting around the whole inheritance tree.
And Xavier, I said, TMTOWTDI.</p>
<p>Xavier wrote back:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And to quote Python, “There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it
...
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you’re Dutch.”</p>

<title>RAD V: &lt;&lt; !!</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>[RAD stands for
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/17/JRuby">Ruby Ape Diaries</a>, of which
this is part V.]
If you look at Ruby code, you keep seeing this little two-character motif
<code>&lt;&lt;</code>, and maybe everyone else already knew about this, but
it sure feels like magic to this farm boy from the Prairies.
Bonus: Lisp speculation.</p>
<p><code>&lt;&lt;</code> is the name of a method, and you can define it to
mean anything you want, but normally it means “append-to-self”.  For a File it
means “Write this on the end”, for an array or list or whatever (and Ruby
doesn’t seem to think there needs to be a difference) it means “add this as a
new element”, and for a string it means “concatenate in place”.</p>
<p>This last operation is particularly useful because, to use Java
terminology, it makes every <code>String</code> into a 
<code>StringWriter</code>.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you’re writing a protocol using <code>Net::HTTP</code>
and you want to get a trace of the dialog.  You say:</p>
<pre><code>session.set_debug_output whatever</code></pre>
<p>Then <code>Net::HTTP</code> uses <code>&lt;&lt;</code> on “whatever” to
store the trace.   So if “whatever” were a file, you’d get a
logfile. But the simplest way to use this is to say:</p>
<pre><code>trace = ""
session.set_debug_output trace</code></pre>
<p>Then you get your session built up in the string “trace”.</p>
<p>For the Ape’s trace function, I needed to keep track of who said what, so I
did something along the lines of:</p>
<pre><code>trace = []
session.set_debug_output trace</code></pre>
<p>Which gave me the dialog in a nice handy list.  In practice, I wrapped the
array in a little class and redefined <code>&lt;&lt;</code> so that I could
timestamp the entries and discard some of the housekeeping like “Connecting
to...”.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Moral of the Story</h2>
<p>Of course, every Rubyist knows this by heart, but it bears repeating: If
you’re writing any kind of logging or data-collection framework, do your
output with <code>&lt;&lt;</code>.  And if you’re building any kind of a data
structure that can grow, don’t forget to implement <code>&lt;&lt;</code>.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Another Example</h2>
<p>I got a bug report from Hugo Duncan
complaining that the Ape wasn’t doing a good job with relative URIs in general
and <code>xml:base</code> in particular.  He was right, the Ape was wrong.
The Ruby libraries have a URI fixer
but don’t seem to grok xml:base, so I had to write an <code>absolutize</code>
function to take a URI, 
the node in the XML tree where it was found, and walk down the tree to the
node building up the appropriate base URI.</p>
<p>First I needed to compute the path from the root to the node:</p>
<pre><code>  def path_to node
    if node.class == REXML::Element
      path_to(node.parent) &lt;&lt; node
    else
      [ ]
    end
  end
</code></pre>
<p>(It’s a pity I’m not preserving Emacs’ nice syntax coloring, but that would
be real work.)  This is a straightforward recursive tree-climb that uses
<code>&lt;&lt;</code> to build up the path.</p>
<p>There’s one more little bit of Ruby magic here; the way REXML builds trees,
you’d normally find that the root element has a parent, an instance of
<code>REXML::Document</code>.  But maybe not; you can get a situation where
that’s not there and the topmost element’s parent is <code>nil</code>.  But
hey, in Ruby everything’s an object, and so is <code>nil</code>, and
<code>nil.class</code> is <code>NilClass</code>, so everything just works.</p>
<p>I’ve noticed that this idiom of referring to <code>whatever.class</code>
irritates real Rubyists.  In this case, they’d be right.  Because assuming I
eventually switch back to JRuby, those nodes won’t be instances of
<code>REXML::Element</code> any more, but they will still have element-ish
methods like <code>attributes</code> or <code>children</code> or whatever.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Lisp</h2>
<p>You notice that phrase “... to build up the path”?  In a perverse mood, I might
have written “... to cons up the path” because, as I would have been informed
by numerous emailers if I didn’t pre-empt it here, every MIT undergrad was doing
this kind of thing in Lisp by 1970, isn’t it quaint that the world is
catching up, etc etc.</p>
<p>And they’d have a point; but Python and Ruby seem to have oozed further
into the mainstream than Lisp ever has.</p>
<p>“Why?” is an interesting question, and I think the biggest single piece of
the answer is inheritance from Perl’s culture of ruthless practicality.  In
other words, not afraid to use syntax to make the point; 
things are generally lists, <em>except when they’re not</em>; attention to
typographic values; building hashes and regexes into the language; not
requiring you to ever say “lambda”.  
Any more?</p>
<p>If Lisp’s audience had been harried sysadmins rather than AI researchers,
it’d rule the world by now.</p>

<title>RAD VII: J?REXML</title>

<body>
<p>[RAD stands for
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/17/JRuby">Ruby Ape Diaries</a>, of which
this is part VII.]
In native Ruby, the default way to do XML processing is via the REXML library.
In JRuby, you have another default choice—Java’s built-in XML APIs.
Neither option is that great.  Still, there are some reasonably safe ways to get
the job done.
I wrote some glue code called JREXML to make the Java APIs look more like
REXML, which forced me to think about this stuff perhaps more than is entirely
healthy.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>REXML</h2>
<p>I and others have
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/17/Why-JRuby">already griped</a> about
REXML’s forgiving attitude to broken XML, but let’s assume that Sam Ruby or
someone else gets around to fixing that.
The REXML API still has some surprises; most notably the “elements” field of
the Element object.  It has a bunch of methods but the most popular is
<code>[]</code>, in which an integer selects a child element by (1-based)
index.  Or you can put an XPath in those brackets, but every time I do, I get
a surprising result that I don’t understand.  Maybe if I could figure out the
following from the
<a href="http://www.germane-software.com/software/rexml/docs/tutorial.html">online docs</a> I’d be able to make it go:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The attribute <code>Element.elements</code> is an <code>Elements</code>
class instance which has the <code>each</code>  and <code>[]</code> methods
for accessing elements. Both methods can be supplied with 
an XPath for filtering, which makes them very powerful.</p>
<p>Since <code>Element</code> is a subclass of <code>Parent</code>, you can also access the
element’s children directly through the Array-like methods <code>Element[]</code>,
<code>Element.each</code>, <code>Element.find</code>,
<code>Element.delete</code>. This is the fastest way of 
accessing children, but note that, being a true array, XPath searches are not
supported, and that all of the element children are contained in this array,
not just the Element children.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id='p-2'>Use XPaths</h2>
<p>But (leaping ahead to this essay’s conclusion), I think that the sensible way to deal
with XML APIs is, if you possibly can, to forget tree walking and depend on XPath.  The combination
of current-context and an XPath can get you pretty well whatever you want out of an
in-memory XML structure in a straightforward way.</p>
<p>The good news is that XPaths seem to work about the same in Java and
REXML; since these are two entirely unrelated implementations, that’s a really
good sign.</p>
<p>There are two pieces of bad news. The first is that XPaths can be tricky to
get right, and it’s made harder by the fact that there are sometimes little
bits of DOM goo that get in your way; the stuff that sits above the root
element and is used to hold &lt;!DOCTYPE> drivel and suchlike.
You can work around this stuff, but you have to do it consciously.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>REXML::XPath.* Has Three Arguments. You Need Them All.</h2>
<p>Another REXML-specific gotcha is that for most real-world XML processing, you need to use
namespaces, and REXML makes it <em>really</em> easy to go off the rails.
Suppose, for example, you want to find all the entries in an Atom feed.
Assuming you trust the structure (as in, you’ve validated it), something like
<code>//atom:feed/atom:entry</code> will do what you need.  The code looks like:</p>
<pre><code>REXML::XPath.each(doc, '//atom:feed/atom:entry') do |entry|
  # use the entry
end</code></pre>
<p>You might idly wonder what namespace does that <code>atom:</code> prefix
map to?  Well, it turns out, whatever <code>atom:</code> is mapped to in the
document you’re searching.  
How whimsical.
<em>Danger, Will Robinson!  On this planet they rely on prefix assignments
from
random input documents.  Repeat: Danger!</em>
If, for some
reason, they’ve mapped <code>http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom</code> to, for
example <code>a:</code>, or used it as the default namespace, both of which
I’ve seen in the wild, you’re hosed.
And if some black-hat has been doing malicious prefix mapping...
</p>
<p>The solution is easy enough:</p>
<pre><code>atomNS = { 'a' => 'http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom' }
REXML::XPath.each(doc, '//a:feed/a:entry', atomNS) do |entry|
  # use the entry
end</code></pre>
<p>Then your XPath will Just Work.  Or at least, mine have been.
But it’s easy to get the impression that it’s OK to leave out that
namespace-hash argument, and that’s really insidious because someone who looks
at a sample doc, and writes their XPaths to work with the sample doc, will
encounter mysterious breakage at some unpredictable later time following on
exposure to real live Internet XML.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>On the Java Side</h2>
<p>The default Java approach to using XML is conformant to the W3C XML DOM,
and this is why alternatives like JDOM and XOM and so on exist.
The DOM tries to be infinitely general and language-independent, and succeeds
at these things, but pays a severe price in usability.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t have been able to figure out how to make it go from the official
docs.
However, some quality time with Elliotte Rusty Harold’s 
<a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-javaxpathapi.html">excellent 
survey</a> over at IBM Developerworks got me pointed in the right direction,
and I recommend it heavily.</p>
<p>Not only is the DOM irritating in general to most
programmers, its Java expression in particular is perhaps not all that it would be in an ideal world.
That’s OK; with a little work, you can in fact make it go, even (as in my
case) peering through the not-quite-100%-transparent Java-to-Ruby porthole.
But do start by reading ERH’s piece.</p>
<p>So, why would anyone use this API?
Because it works, and in any reasonably-modern Java installation, you know
it’s going to Just Be There.
For some people, this is not a very compelling reason; but for others it’s a
big deal.  Choose your poison.</p>

<body>
<p>[RAD stands for

The reason I first built the Ape in JRuby was so I could get at all those nice
Java APIs, and that turned out to be a good reason.
Of course, there is a bit of impedence mismach, and I ended up writing some
glue code.
I kind of suspect that, should JRuby catch on, there’s going to be scope for
quite a bit of this glue-ware.
This fragment is just a few examples of the genre, to provide examples and
perhaps provoke thought.</p>
<p>All but one of these examples omit an initial <code>require 'java'</code> and a bunch
of lines of <code>include_class</code>.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>Table of Contents</h2>

<h2 id='p-1'>Parsing an XML Document</h2>
<p>There are lots of ways to do this, but I’m using about the plainest-vanilla
Java approach.
This is somewhat but not entirely unlike <code>REXML::Document.new</code>.</p>
<pre><code>def Document.new(text)
  begin
    unless @@dbf
      @@dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance
      @@dbf.setNamespaceAware true

    db = @@dbf.newDocumentBuilder

  rescue NativeException
    @last_error = $!.to_s

end</code></pre>
<h2 id='p-2'>XML Escaping and Unescaping</h2>
<p>Not strictly Java-related, but kind of interesting.  I’m sure this is
    somewhere in Ruby but for some reason I couldn’t find it, 
    so this code survives in the native-Ruby version of the Ape.</p>
<pre><code>def Parser.escape(text)
  text.gsub(/([&amp;&lt;&apos;&quot;&gt;])/) do
    case $1
    when &apos;&amp;&apos; then &apos;&amp;amp;&apos;

<h2 id='p-3'>Serializing XML</h2>
<p>The XML is stored in an <code>org.w3c.dom</code> structure.
This is just a partial implementation; it works for me because I produce an
  entity-free DOM.
This is more elaborate than it needs to be because I thought I was going to
  have to take care of all the namespace-declaration book-keeping, but no, it
  seems that the DOM has all the <code>xmlns</code> goo appearing as if they
  were actual attributes.  Go figure.</p>
<p>It’s interesting to note that you access Java fields using Ruby’s
  <code>::</code> separator.</p>
<pre><code>  class Unparser

    def initialize output
      @output = output
    end

    def unparse doc
      unparse1 doc.dom
    end

    def unparse1 node
      case node.getNodeType
      when Node::CDATA_SECTION_NODE, Node::TEXT_NODE
        out Parser.escape(node.getNodeValue)
      when Node::COMMENT_NODE, Node::PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION_NODE
        # bah
      when Node::DOCUMENT_NODE
        node = node.getFirstChild

      out '&lt;/'
      unparseName node
      out '>'
    end
  end</code></pre>
<h2 id='p-4'>XPath</h2>
<p>The three useful XPath functions in REXML are <code>each</code>,
      <code>first</code>, and <code>match</code>.  Here are the JRuby
      versions.</p>
<pre><code>  class XPath 
    @@xpf = nil

    def XPath.match node, path, namespaces={}
      node = fixNode node
      xp = XPath.newXP namespaces
      collect xp.evaluate(path, node, XPathConstants::NODESET)    
    end

    def XPath.each node, path, namespaces = {}
      node = fixNode node
      xp = XPath.newXP namespaces
      list = xp.evaluate(path, node, XPathConstants::NODESET)
      collect(list).each { |node| yield node }
    end

    def XPath.first node, path, namespaces = {}
      node = fixNode node
      xp = XPath.newXP namespaces
      xp.evaluate(path, node, XPathConstants::NODE)
    end</code></pre>
<p>I’ve tested them and they do what you’d expect, the real Ruby versions
      dropped in without anything breaking.  Now, there are some interesting
      housekeeping functions, all private.  In particular,
      <code>newXP</code>, which needs to exist because a Java XPath needs an
      interface to call back to get namespace-prefix mappings.
(Cognoscenti will note the theft of a line of code from REXML:Xpath).</p>
<pre><code>
    def XPath.newXP namespaces
      raise "The namespaces argument, if supplied, must be a hash object." unless namespaces.kind_of? Hash
      @@xpf ||= XPathFactory.newInstance
      xp = @@xpf.newXPath

      xp.namespaceContext= NSCT.new namespaces
      return xp
    end</code></pre>
<p>You might wonder how you implement a Java <em>Interface</em> in JRuby?  No
      problem, inherit from it just like any other class-like thingie.    No
      need to implement any of the interface’s methods if you don’t use them.
This feels strange, exotic, and cool to me.</p>
<pre><code>  class NSCT &lt; NamespaceContext

    def initialize namespaces
      super()  # Required due to bug JRuby-66
      @namespaces = namespaces
    end

    def getNamespaceURI prefix
      if prefix == 'xml' 
        XMLConstants::XML_NS_URI
      else
        @namespaces[prefix]
      end
    end</code></pre>
<h2 id='p-5'>Attribute Hashing</h2>
<p>REXML gives each element an <code>attributes</code> member which is a hash
      of attribute value by name.  Here’s the Java-based namespace-sensitive
      version.</p>
<pre><code>  class Attributes

    # should only be called by Element
    def initialize node
      @attrsNode = node.getAttributes
    end

    def [] name
      if name =~ /^(.*):(.*)$/
        ns = node.getNamespaceURI $1
        anode = @attrsNode.getNamedItemNS(ns, $2)
      else
        anode = @attrsNode.getNamedItem(name)
      end
      anode.getNodeValue
    end

  end</code></pre>
<h2 id='p-6'>Rubyfying a NodeList</h2>
<p>The problem is that lots of things in the Java DOM are
<code>NodeLists</code>, which are retrieved by number.  You can’t do anything
in Ruby without an <code>each</code>-like method, so here it is.</p>
<pre><code>    def each_node(list)
      len = list.getLength
      (0 ... len).each do |i|
        yield list.item(i)
      end
    end</code></pre>
<h2 id='p-8'>Calling Jing</h2>
<p>As I said before, the Jing API is fairly gnarly. This is perhaps the most
extreme example of brute-forcing the way across the impedence mismatch.
In this case I include all the includes.</p>
<pre><code>require 'java'
include_class 'com.thaiopensource.validate.rng.CompactSchemaReader'

<p>Every year I spend a few days on a family member’s farm in Saskatchewan;
this is usually followed by many photos of cows and Prairie landscapes here on
<span class='o'>ongoing</span>. 
The Internet there is dial-up but usable, with the application of some
discipline.
Only this year, I fired up my recently-repaired Mac and it told me that my
internal modem did not exist.
Repeated reboots failed to make any progress, and I couldn’t really get to the
Apple knowledge base.  That’s OK, all I <em>really</em> need is email and I
could use the secure-webmail interface for that.  Only for some reason, that wasn’t
working; incomprehensible error messages about something being misconfigured.
Ouch; so I filed a trouble ticket and called my boss’ admin and asked her to drop me a voicemail if
anything super-important went across our group alias.
Then when I called back to check my messages, my personalized Sun 1-877 number
gave me a busy signal.  Clearly, some heavenly power did not want me
interacting with work.  So I closed the computer with an emphatic “snap”
and went to take a crap, and the toilet backed up.</p>

</head>
<body>
<p>On Thursday,
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/08/11/MomsGarden">my Mother</a> made the best
pie I’ve ever eaten.  I suspect that there are many people who’ve never
actually eaten a good fruit pie made that day with fresh ingredients,
traditional methods, and love.
This was an apple pie, the apples <em>extremely</em> tart; the filling 
electric with fruit and cinnamon and the pastry divinely crumbly on the tongue;
words can’t begin to describe it.
I’ve included the recipe.</p>
<p>The recipe takes the form of an MP3 (also appearing as a podcast in my
Atom feed): <enclosure href="Jean-Bray-Apple-Pie.mp3">Jean Bray’s Apple Pie
Recipe</enclosure> (6:03).
It was just Mom and I sitting on the sofa recording through the Mac’s built-in
microphone, so the audio quality is terrible.   But it’s the only place in the
world where this unique creative formula is recorded.  And if you can find some
really good tart apples and master the technique (which is nontrivial),
you’ll forgive the sound issues.</p>

<p>This fell out of a conversation at JavaOne, which, these days, is more or
less the heart of the IT Establishment; we were wondering what the
equivalent event might be for everyone else in the world.  I said it ought to
be an unconference or a camp or something along those lines, so there was
more talk, some of it  with
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/bio.php#berlind">David Berlind</a>, who’s
launched the very successful
<a href="http://www.mashupcamp.com/">MashupCamp</a> series.  Now we’re
seriously considering an Autumn event in the Bay Area.  I wanted it to
call it “Scaling 2.0”, but the consensus seems to be for “Startup Camp”, since
the idea is to address people who are building new things from scratch, as
opposed to working in the existing application space.  Here’s an address:
<a href="mailto:StartupCamp@sun.com">startupcamp@sun.com</a>.  Would you come?

<title>RAD VIII: Surface Phenomena</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>[RAD stands for
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/17/JRuby">Ruby Ape Diaries</a>, of which
this is part VIII.]
Programming is supposed to be an engineering discipline, or maybe a branch of
mathematics.  But, as Don Box memorably said: “the only people who should do
it are those who can't not do it”, calling us “those few people who absolutely
must live in the world of executable abstractions”.  One consequence is that we’re
passionate about the content and the form.
Herewith some remarks on appearances; the way
Ruby code looks and how you store it and so on; issues as important, perhaps,
as any other.</p>
<p>As I wrote a few days ago, Ruby has a 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/20/TMTOWTDI">TMTOWTDI</a> culture;
for anything that’s worth doing, there are lots of different ways.  
This has made me alternately uncomfortable and happy.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Files</h2>
<p>When I’m Rubying, I have to think about how to deal the code out into
files.  A few years of Java have apparently atrophied the part of my brain that
does this.  In Java, for those who don’t know, if you’ve got a
class called <code>com.textuality.Lark</code>, the source has to live in
<code>com/textuality/Lark.java</code>, and the compiler will generate
<code>com/textuality/Lark.class</code>, and that’s all there is to it.  If
you’re living in an IDE like NetBeans, this means that you totally never think
about files; you think in terms of classes and packages and the IDE puts the
code where the code needs to go.</p>
<p>In Ruby, it’s perfectly legitimate (and common) to have four or five
different classes, perhaps only loosely related, in a file.  
I’ve done it, my REXML-for-Java stand-in has <code>Element</code> and
<code>Attribute</code> and <code>Document</code> classes all in one file and
it seems natural and convenient.</p>
<p>Even if you wanted to, you probably
couldn’t impose a Java-like discipline because in the middle of your
<code>FishFrying</code> module you might decide to add some new methods to
<code>File</code> or <code>String</code>.</p>
<p>Still, I’m not entirely convinced that it’s a good use of my time to think
about where to put the code.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Names</h2>
<p>Which is better, <code>removeCamisole</code> or
<code>remove_camisole</code>?
In Java, you never have to ask yourself this question because the
first option, “lowerCamelCase”, is so deeply wired into the culture that doing
anything else would amount to egregious abuse of anyone who might have to
maintain the code you write.</p>
<p>Ruby uses CamelCase for classes and leans to underbars elsewhere; although
I’ve run across a few instances of CamelCase in method and module names. 
In the Ape code, I started up doing things in the Java style, but pretty
quickly decided this was wrong, and have tried to stay in underbar territory,
although there are a few lingering camels in the underbrush.</p>
<p>I think that for JRuby, in particular, this convention should be taken very
seriously, so that by looking at something’s name you’ll know which side of
the fence it comes from.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Parentheses</h2>
<p>This one drives me nuts.  I have actually spent nontrivial amounts of time
looking at my code and agonizing over whether some method call should have
them or not.</p>
<p>It’d be tempting to impose a simple policy: Parentheses always!  Because
this kind of thinking seems like a waste of time.  On the other hand, the
judicious omission of parentheses is one reason that Ruby code can be so
readable.  It seems pretty clear to me that for straightforward conditionals,
compulsory parentheses are just static.  Here are some ifs from the Ape code:</p>
<pre><code>if uri =~ /^https?:/
if type == 'text' || type == 'html'
if collections.length > 0</code></pre>
<p>On the other other hand, as a matter of principle I have refused to learn
the precedence rules of any language I’ve ever used, and applied a
Draconian policy of parenthesize-on-the-slightest-doubt.  Once again, from the
Ape:</p>
<pre><code>if (!found_entry_coll) &amp;&amp; collection.accept.index('entry')</code></pre>
<p>But it’s method calls and declarations where the
to-<code>()</code>-or-not-to-<code>()</code> angst really bites.
One-argument calls and declarations generally don’t seem to need parentheses,
with the exception of <code>Whatever.new(foo)</code>, where they for some
inchoate reason feel necessary.  Do zero-argument calls <em>ever</em> need
parentheses?  I think not.</p>
<p>I went through the Ape code and looked at all the places where I’d put
parentheses on one-argument calls, and they were all either <code>new</code>
or some sort of factory method, or “retrieval” methods that take an arg and
emit a value:</p>
<pre><code>ids &lt;&lt; entry.child_content('id')</code></pre>
<p>Maybe the right answer is to figure out how to turn these into instances of
<code>[]</code> so I’d be saying <code>entry.child_content['id']</code> and
not sweating the parentheses.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Domain-Specific Languages</h2>
<p>The Rubyists are always talking about creating them and what a great thing
this is.
As far as I can tell, they’re mostly just pimped-out method calls without
benefit of <code>()</code>.</p> 
<h2 id='p-4'>Readability</h2>
<p>It’s all about readability.  It’s <em>really</em> all about readability.
Code is maintained much longer than it’s written, and anything that makes it
more readable is a really, really big deal.</p>
<p>Readability is important enough that maybe it’s OK that I have to stop and
think about parentheses.</p>
<p>Readability is important enough that Ruby is right to allow, and Java wrong
to forbid, the use of <code>nil</code> as <code>false</code> and non-<code>nil</code> as
<code>true</code> in conditionals, so Ruby allows this 
useful, highly-readable idiom, originally invented for C:</p>
<pre><code>if handler &amp;&amp; handler.check_content(message)</code></pre>
<p>(Note that Perl is wrong in allowing <code>""</code> and <code>0</code> to
stand for <code>false</code>, as I think most PerlMongers would now agree.)</p>
<p>Readability is important enough that incorporating Perl’s
abbreviated-conditional syntax is good:</p>
<pre><code>return true unless content_type == 'application/atom+xml'</code></pre>
<p>Readibility is important enough to make Ruby’s method/block idiom a better
way to iterate than anything else I’ve seen anywhere.</p>

<title>Scam Spam</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I don’t know about you, but in recent weeks I’ve been hit with 
high volumes of spam promoting penny stocks.  They are elaborately crafted and
go through my spam defenses like a hot knife through butter.  When I was off
the net for 72 hours last week, the volume actually filled up the POP inbox at
one of my accounts and my mail started bouncing.
By the way, you can find the people who do it with a search for “Stock
Promotion” (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=stock%20promotion">G</a>,
<a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=stock+promotion">Y</a>).
As a consequence of living in Vancouver, long a headquarters for penny-stock
promoters, I have some personal exposure to how incredibly devious, energized,
and unprincipled these people are; it’s like trying to root out cockroaches in
a warm climate.  Part of the problem is that there is apparently an
inexhaustible supply of suckers ready to march smiling into the jaws
of these bottom-feeders.
This could be the straw that finally breaks the back of email as we know it,
the kind that costs nothing to send and something to receive.</p>

Ruby’s debugging facilities, compared to what IDE users like me are used to,
are, well... <i>sincere</i>.
At one point during the Ape work, I had a bug that was really driving me
crazy.  The symptom was that my HTTP interaction with the server would just
freeze up, and I couldn’t spot the pattern behind it.
It’s a fact of protocol-testing life that this particular kind of shit happens.
Sometimes you’re reduced to debugging with print statements, and I was.
But after a while they weren’t helping me, I was calling
<code>Net::HTTP#start</code> on an apparently-valid connection and
then... nothing.
Eventually, I was driven to looking in the library source,
<code>net/http.rb</code>.  Hey, it was easy to understand! (Have I talked about
Ruby and readability before?)  I could see where
my request was going, but I couldn’t see how it could go wrong.  Well, this is
a dev machine, and Real Men debug with <code>print</code> statements.  So in
they went... right into the Ruby distro libraries, I mean.  And I ran it again.  Only
took a couple of minutes to zero in the problem; in this case, a
<a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-94">JRuby bug</a>.
I’m not sure what the lesson is... but the code spelunking was frighteningly
easy.  This is not typical of other peoples’ HTTP libraries; I have bitter
memories of bashing my head to a bloody pulp against LWP back in the last millennium.
Did I mention readability?

<title>RAD X: Making Markup</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>[RAD stands for
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/17/JRuby">Ruby Ape Diaries</a>, of which
this is part X.]
If you’re writing Web apps, and even if you’re one of the few who
isn’t, you’re probably going to have write code to generate markup, HTML or
XML.
Historically, programmers have found this difficult, and thus there are lots
of libraries that try to abstract markup away behind code (for example,
my own
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/02/20/GenxStatus">Genx</a>).
There are tricky issues and trade-offs here, and Ruby throws them into pretty
sharp focus.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Simple Way</h2>
<p>Generating XML isn’t <em>that</em> tough, you just use print statements and
make sure to escape any magic syntax characters, and make really sure you’re
handling the Unicode issues.   Alternatively, you can use
a library like Genx with primitives like <code>startElement</code>
and <code>addAttribute</code> and so on.</p>
<p>But this is pretty low-level, and it there’s an obvious tension between the
(hierarchical) structure of XML and the (linear) structure of your program.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Templating</h2>
<p>Near as I can tell, most of the XML that’s programmatically generated out
there in the real world is template-driven.  PHP is probably the leader in
terms of volume, if only because there are just <em>way too many</em>
Java templating systems.</p>
<p>In Ruby-land, Rails’ RHTML seems to be the winner.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Content Blocks</h2>
<p>Of course, it takes about ten seconds for an XML-savvy programmer to look
at Ruby’s block structure and have the little light go on over her head saying
“Hey, I’ll have a method that takes care of the start tags and end tags, and
the block fills in the content.”  For the Ape, I accidentally invented one of
these myself for doing HTML <code>&lt;li></code> structures, the first cut
looked like</p>
<pre><code>  def lip
    print "&lt;li>&lt;p>"
    yield
    puts "&lt;/p>&lt;/li>"
  end</code></pre>
<p>But then I realized you might want to have multiple paragraphs in your list
item, and I needed a hook to put in the links to the client/server dialogs,
and it grew.</p>
<p>If you read the Pickaxe book, they point out that the <code>CGI</code>
module does this; check the first-edition text 
<a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/web.html">here</a>
and search for “Creating Forms”.</p>
<p>The Second Edition Pickaxe goes on to say “Although quite interesting, this method
of generating HTML is fairly laborious and probably isn’t used much in
practice.  Most people seem to write the HTML directly, use a templating
system, or use an application framework...”</p>
<p>I don’t know, I thought the example code looked OK.
For the ultimate expression of this kind of thinking, check out _why’s
<a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/inspect/markabyForRails.html">Markaby</a>;
here’s an example:</p>
<pre><code> html do
   head do
     title action_name
     stylesheet_link_tag 'scaffold'
   end

   body do
     p flash[:notice], :style => "color: green" 
     self &lt;&lt; @content_for_layout
   end
 end</code></pre>
<p>Hmm... there are a couple of non-obvious things going on.  The text
     explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>As you can see all the normal helpers and variables are
     present. There is one caveat: <b>in default Markaby, helper methods are
     automatically output when called</b>. So, in the above, the
     stylesheet_link_tag gets output. (To turn that off, use @output_helpers =
     false.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Do you understand that?  I don’t.  A few more months of Rubying, though, and
     I probably would.</p>
<p>Markaby is clever; some of those methods like
     <code>html</code> and <code>body</code> and <code>p</code> are defined,
     but some aren’t; they’re caught by <code>missing_method</code>, which
     generates tags based on the method name.</p>
<p>It bothers me though; some of the element methods have built-in
     semantics and some don’t.  And you can give XML elements names that will
     cause you headaches in Ruby, like <code>&lt;first-step></code> (yes, you
     can in fact have methods with names like that using
     <code>define_method</code> and <code>send</code> voodoo, but you’d rather
     not).</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>RGenx?</h2>
<p>So it occurs that it wouldn’t be that hard to do a completely generalized
     and kind of elegant XML generator in Ruby.  Off the top of my head, I’m
     thinking of something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A per-doc <code>Namespaces</code> thingie that you (optionally) use to declare namespace prefixes.</p></li>
<li><p>An <code>AttList</code> class that builds a hash of attributes you want
     on some element; you add attributes to it by providing their namespace URI, 
     local-part, and value; it takes care of escaping the value.</p></li>
<li><p>An <code>element</code> method that takes a namespace URI, a
     local-part, an <code>AttList</code>; and a body that fills in the
     content.</p></li>
<li><p>A <code>text</code> method that takes care of escaping and
     output.</p></li>
<li><p>Like Genx, you’d want to set a target for the output so that the
     <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/22/Lt-Lt">magic of &lt;&lt;</a> would
     let you build things in memory or send ’em down a pipe.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I think that’s all you’d need.  In Genx I added all sorts of black magic to
     allow changing namespace prefixes mid-stream and so on, but that seems
     very un-Rubyish.</p>
<p>But, does the world need such a thing?  Probably not.</p>

<title>Spolsky Starts a Language War</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>In Joel Spolsky’s new
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/09/01.html">Language
Wars</a>, he argues that .NET, Java, PHP, and maybe Python are the safe
choices if you’re going to build out a Web app that’s really big and really
critical.
He ices this cake with a shovelful of classic FUD aimed at Ruby and Rails.
Not surprisingly, David Heinemeier Hansson volleys back twice with
<a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000596.html">Fear, Uncertain, and Doubt by Joel Spolsky</a>
and 
<a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000597.html">Was Joel’s Wasabi a
joke?</a>
Bruce Tate has a more thoughtful response over at InfoQ:
<a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/From-Java-to-Ruby--Risk">From Java to
Ruby: Risk</a>.  You may not agree with all of Bruce’s points, but they’re
well argued.
It may surprise some who’ve endured the flood of Ruby-red writing around here
recently, but I think Joel’s correct that Python is quite a bit better proven
than Ruby; and also that Ruby has a big Unicode problem.
But I can’t get around the fact that Joel sounds <em>exactly</em> like a
mainframe droid talking about Personal Computers, or a VMS droid talking
about Unix, or an EDI droid talking about the Web, or a C++ droid
talking about Java.  Yeah, the new thing is
kinda unproven and kinda shaky in places and kinda slow and not very
full-featured.
But it’s got ease-of-use advantages and programmer-productivity advantages and
developers like to use it.  See the
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/01/03/TPM1">Technology
Predictor Success Matrix</a>, and particularly the last three criteria:

and especially the
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/01/14/TPSM-8020">80/20 Point</a>.
Joel’s probably wrong.</p>

<title>White Rock Dock</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Central Vancouver is about 50km north of the U.S. border.  Down at the
border, on the seaside, is the town of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Rock">White Rock</a>, which has a
beach extending right to the edge of America, a traditional pier, and a whole
lot of restaurants.  I’ve been living here mostly for over twenty years and
never visited it, so we did, and I took some pictures off the pier.
There actually is a White Rock; I have no pictures of that, but I do have an
international-boundary shot.</p>
<p>I’m not sure we’ll go back; Vancouver’s foodie values have made it down
here, judging by our lunch, but the dense unassuming multi-ethnic general-purpose
buzz hasn’t so much; it was actually pretty suburban.</p>
<p>Here’s the context:</p>
<img src="IMGP3906.jpg" alt="The U.S.-Canadian border from the White Rock pier" />
<p>This is way out on the pier, looking back south-east at the beach.  The
bright white object off to the right is the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_Arch">Peace Arch</a> (Yow, the
Wikipedia now covers <em>everything</em>), which most
people in this part of the world occasionally get to spend an hour or so
inching by when the border traffic gets slow.</p>
<p>The big white object looming over the whole scene is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Baker">Mount Baker</a>.</p>
<p>Anyhow, once we got out to the end of the pier I thought the most
interesting view was down into the water.  The first picture is just
gratuitous weirdness, but in the second, can you spot the waterline?  The pink
thing is a starfish.</p>
<img src="IMGP3898.jpg" alt="Looking down off the White Rock pier" />
<img src="IMGP3902.jpg" alt="Looking down off the White Rock pier" />
<p>Oh yes, the white rock.  It’s a generic boulder, maybe six or seven metres
high, looks like a glacial left-over to me; anyhow, there were lots of
informative plaques about First Nations traditions which I didn’t read; but
the rock had a couple of logs leaned up against it so random passers-by could
try to make it to the top.  Not all who tried succeeded, but my seven-year-old
boy did; he needed a firm hand on the butt to scramble up the logs but managed
the tricky spider-crawl to the top of the rock on his own.</p>

<p>So sad to hear that Craig died.  (He doesn’t have a Wikipedia entry,
someone who knew him better than I should
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Cline">make one</a>.)
I owe Craig a lot; I was one of the people who came to the Web from a
mostly-publishing-tech background, and liked it the moment I saw it.  It may
sound weird now, but a lot of publishing people hated it and fought it,
because it didn’t do WYSIWYG and you couldn’t exercise fine control over font
leading and image bleeds and so on.  Craig put me on stage at the Seybold
conference time after time—it was the centre of the publishing-tech world then—to
tell people that this thing was OK, that they could still be designers, they
just had to live with losing control over size and shape, that typography and
color and white space still mattered.  I don’t know, frankly, if it did the
audiences any good, but the conversations I had there sure helped me.  Craig
was a good man.</p>

<title>Hay Bales</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>In mid-August Saskatchewan, the first crop of hay bales is out in the
fields.</p>
<p>These are no longer the traditional brick-shaped bales that a strong adult could flip
with a pitchfork; they’re round, taller than most people, and you move them with a
fork-lift attachment on the front of a tractor.   It’s way more efficient and
handling bales may look romantic, but I’ve done it and it sucks.</p>
<img src="IMGP3968.jpg" alt="August hay bales in Saskatchewan" />
<p>Scattered across the fields, they have something of the look of the
megalithic <i>alignements</i> in 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/02/18/FSS">Brittany</a>.
Or individually against the sky like the big stones at
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/05/05/FSS">Avebury</a>.</p>
<img src="IMGP3973.jpg" alt="Saskatchewan hay bale in silhouette" />
<p>But get up close and they really don’t look like anything but what they
are.  Through the winter, the cattle make this into beefsteak.</p>

<title>RAD XI: Where To?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>[RAD stands for
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/17/JRuby">Ruby Ape Diaries</a>, of which
this is part XI.]
I think this concludes the Diaries, although <span class='o'>ongoing</span>
already has a couple of five-part trilogies.
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/11/Meet-the-Ape">The Ape</a> works
reasonably well and is getting quite a bit of use; Sam Ruby has convinced me
that, rather than whittle away at the 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/11/Meet-the-Ape#p-4">to-do list</a>, I
ought to figure out a way to build a large catalog of problems and edge
cases, test-suite style, in such a way that you can add new ones without
writing code.
I haven’t yet figured out how to do it.
My Ruby is still not fully
idiomatic but it’s better than pidgin, and there’s a real possibility that the
next time I get my back to a wall and need to do something to a few million
lines of text <em>right now</em>, I may not use Perl.
It should be reasonably obvious that I like Ruby.  Still, there are flies in
the ointment, worms in the apple, fake jewels in the shop window.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>An IDE</h2>
<p>Ruby needs an IDE.  All programming languages need IDEs.  Some Rubyists
push back, pointing out that you only need to write one-third as many
lines as if you had to do the job in Java, so you shouldn’t need crutches.</p>
<p>Horseshit.  Here are a bunch of things that an IDE does for you that would
make Rubyists’ lives more fun and more productive:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There should be a background parser running all the time so that you
always know if you have syntax errors and can jump to them with one click; it
is so totally a waste of time for me to save, then try to run, a file that the
computer is in a position to know won’t work.</p></li>
<li><p>I shouldn’t have to type the names of well-known methods, like
<code>File.new</code> or <i>(anything)</i><code>.each</code>, or type in
closing parentheses or the keyword <code>end</code>, or
fill in more than a couple of characters of
<code>begin</code>/<code>rescue</code>/<code>ensure</code> structures; it is
never correct for a human to hit keys when a computer, in principle, could
provide the input.</p></li>
<li><p>The computer should help with refactoring; and all you <em>really</em>
need is renaming.  I regularly 
want to change the names of classes and variables and methods (if only to add
or subtract a <code>@</code>), and it is so so stupid that I have to go
mousing all over my files to find all the places that the name needs changing;
that’s what computers are for.</p></li>
<li><p>I should never have to scroll much; IDEs go to a lot of trouble to make
it trivial to jump from wherever to the source for the method being called, or
its docs, or the next compile error or breakpoint, or variable declaration, or
whatever.  Scrolling back and forth in a source-code file is just stupid.</p></li>
<li><p>Unit testing should be part of the infrastructure.  To create a test,
or run a test, or look at test results, you shouldn’t have to hit more than
one keystroke.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not saying it’s easy.  Java’s static typing gives an IDE a lot more to
work with, and I wouldn’t insist on super-intelligent auto-complete in a
brand-new project; but who spends their time on brand-new projects?  Once I’ve
got a few hundred lines of code, the IDE should damn well know what my classes
and methods are.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Docs</h2>
<p>The fact that Ruby’s documentation is laughably incomplete, and that the
entirely-essential
<a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/">Ruby-Doc.org</a> site has awkward,
irritating navigation hurts less than you’d think, because as I’ve previously
noted, the language’s extreme readability make it a viable option to skip the
docs and go straight to the source.</p>
<p>A teeny little example: Today I needed to know the class hierarchy under
<a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Exception.html">Exception</a>,
and maybe it’s there online but I couldn’t find it. 
Blecch.  Hint: Pickaxe, 2nd ed., page 462.</p>
<p>Still...</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Libraries</h2>
<p>The conventional wisdom is that compared to Python &amp; Java &amp; Lisp
&amp; Smalltalk, Ruby is a more beautiful language but has weaker libraries.
I haven’t gone deep enough to be definitive, but the evidence I’ve seen
supports that view.
In particular, in an XML-centric world, REXML is a real problem.</p>
<p>(To be fair, I’ve found that <code>Net::HTTP</code> is just the thing, if
you’re writing a protocol exerciser.)</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Unicode</h2>
<p>It’s easy to make people angry about this subject, and some of the angry
people have a point; certain aspects of Unicode are, on the surface at least,
objectively racist; for example, why does UTF-8 encoding of characters become
progressively less efficient as you move from the languages of the Western
hemisphere to those of the East?</p>
<p>Having said all that, it is my opinion that Unicode works pretty well, and
in terms of making the Internet useful to the many peoples of Earth, is part
of the solution, not part of the problem.  And for that reason, I think that
any language that doesn’t do a real good job at Unicode isn’t a very good
citizen.  And I think Ruby has a major problem in this area.  Solutions are
promised; we’ll see.  And hey, in a few weeks I’m going to get up a stage in a
room in Denver full of Rubyists and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/07/19/RubyConf">talk about this stuff</a>;
we’ll see whether they let me out of town alive.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Integration</h2>
<p>Here’s what seems like the biggest problem to me, and it’s not a Ruby
problem, or really even specific to any language.  Java ain’t going away, and
neither is .NET nor PHP nor Python nor Rails.  How we gonna get all these
things talking to each other?  Hint: the answer isn’t WS-*.  Two or more of
these language communities need to drive a stake in the ground and say “Do it
this way” and get a trend going.  Why not Ruby?</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>The End</h2>
<p>Even with all these little irritations, Ruby might win, big-time; it’s that
good.  And if
someone wanted to throw some engineering cycles at a few interesting problems
with potentially huge pay-offs, well, here they are.</p>

<title>Went Camping</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>In Canada and the US, the first Monday in September is a holiday (“Labour
Day”) and then the kids start school on Tuesday.   This year, we spent the
long weekend at camp.  It was entirely traditional and very good.
Herewith nature shots and campfire tales, some musical.</p>
<p>Our son attends
<a href="http://lecole-bilingue.vsb.bc.ca/">L’École Bilingue</a>, a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Immersion">French Immersion</a>
school here in Vancouver.  For thirty years, L’École has had a family summer
camp over the Labour-Day weekend at
<a href="http://www.evanslake.com/">Evans Lake</a>; there is only room for 80
attendees, parents and children, so not everyone can go.  But we signed up
early enough and had a fine time.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Location</h2>
<p>Evans Lake isn’t that far from Vancouver and is still pretty far out in the
woods, down a few km of really lousy road.  The side of the lake across from
the camp is in
<a href="http://www.squamish.net/">Squamish Nation</a> territory.
The mountains and the lake and the vegetation are all quite lovely; here are
young maples growing under the evergreen cover.</p>
<img src="IMGP4225.jpg" alt="Maple leaves under forest cover near Squamish, BC" />
<img src="IMGP4226.jpg" alt="Maple leaves under forest cover near Squamish, BC" />
<p>The lake is nothing special by Canadian standards.  It’s pretty deep, thus
chilly even at the end of a hot clear summer.  The swimming dock stretches out
into the middle of the lake, which is a good idea because it gets pretty
organic in the shallows.</p>
<img src="IMGP4215.jpg" alt="Evans Lake, British Columbia, Canada" />
<p>There’s a nice little trail around the lake that we used for the
junior-kids’ hike, which went by an interesting vertical rock outcropping a
few hundred feet high.
I went off on my own one morning and found a fairly-scary trail up the side of
that little mountain; nice scenery all the way.</p>
<img src="IMGP4222.jpg" alt="Mountainside near Evans Lake" />
<p>The trail came out on a wonderful little ledge, an eyrie with a sweeping
view down onto the lake and out over the mountains and forest, 
right out of Tolkien.  None of my pictures came close to capturing the scale;
it was a little hazy, which didn’t help.  But this shot straight down into the
lake is kind of interesting, although there’s no sense that you’re looking a
long, long way.</p>
<img src="IMGP4234.jpg" alt="Looking down on Evans Lake" />
<h2 id='p-2'>Campfire Culture</h2>
<p>I never did the camp thing as a kid, but I’ve read about them, and this was
very traditional.  The kids slept in bunkhouses with their teenage
“counsellors”, who also organized swimming and canoeing and volleyball and so
on; they had a blast and whooped it up pretty intensely in the bunkhouse long
after they should have been asleep.</p>
<p>Of course, with the kids in hand except for some afternoon family time, the
parents were left to lounge by the lake except for when they were organizing
some activity (everybody had to sign up for one); read books, take pictures, or go swim
with the kids.  So that part was pretty relaxing.</p>
<p>In the evenings, we had the traditional campfire, with the traditional
skits—kids the first night, parents the second.  The younger kids’ skits were
bad jokes, toilet humor, and slapstick, and I’m quite sure have been performed
in exactly the same way at campfires for centuries.  A few of the older girls
did some really amusing song-and-dance routines.</p>
<p>This being Vancouver, the adults included a few movie-biz people, so a
couple of the skits were highly overproduced, but great fun.</p>
<p>The campfire ended nine-ish, and after the kids had been put to bed, we had
a grown-ups’ party in the Rec hall in front of its fireplace.  This being
Vancouver, the adults included a few foodies, so along with the shrimps and
cold cuts, the spread included olive tapenade, home-made chipotle salsa, barbecued
oysters, and was pretty damn toothsome.
Plus there were grown-up drinks.</p>
<p>At both the outdoor and indoor fires, we played music and sang.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Musical Heritage</h2>
<p>It turned out that one kid’s parents, first-timers this year, were really
gifted singers and guitarists who could play almost anything and sang beautiful
harmony.  There was one other guitarist, a few more singers, and I brought my
djembé along to thump.</p>
<p>I seem to recall members of earlier generations talking about the Good Old
Days before everything went electronic, when they gathered around and sang the
Good Old Songs.  Well, we can do that too, and there are Good New Songs;
we covered

<title>JRuby Love</title>
</head>
<body>
<p><a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/">Charles Nutter</a> and
<a href="http://www.bloglines.com/blog/ThomasEEnebo/">Thomas Enebo</a>, better
known as “The JRuby Guys”, are joining Sun this month.  Yes, I helped make
this happen, and for once, you’re going to be getting the Sun PR party line, because
I wrote most of it.
<i>[Update: It strikes me that thank-yous are in order.  Given that Sun is in
the process of (appropriately) slashing some of its engineering groups, new
hires are a little tricky.  A lot of people helped, but I think the biggest
contributions were from our Software CTO
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/brewin/">Bob Brewin</a> and especially
<a href="http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/media/bios/bios-green.html">Rich
Green</a>, who approved the reqs about fifteen seconds after Bob and I raised
the issue.]</i></p>
<p>Jacki DeCoster, one of our PR people, tried to imagine what kinds of
questions people would have, and we went from there.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Why is Sun hiring JRuby developers Charles Nutter and Thomas
Enebo?</h2>
<p>First, they are excellent developers.  Technologies like Ruby are getting 
intense interest from the developer
community, and Sun is interested in anything that  developers care about.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>What will their new role be at Sun?</h2>
<p>First, they have to get JRuby to 1.0 and make sure that the major
applications are running smoothly and are performant. </p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Will they work on JRuby full time?</h2>
<p>Yes, but they also have a mandate to think about developer tools.  Right
now, developers who use dynamic languages like Python and Ruby are poorly
served, compared to what Java developers have.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Will JRuby be “owned” by Sun?</h2>
<p>No.  JRuby has existed for a long time as a project; it has its own
culture, community, license, and codebase, and there are no plans for
significant changes.</p> 
<h2 id='p-5'>What will Sun be doing with JRuby?</h2>
<p>Perhaps most important, we hope to learn from this
experience. Dynamically-typed languages like Ruby are only beginning to be
accepted in the software mainstream, and many of the best practices and tools
remain to be invented.  Second, we'd like to ensure that the Ruby programming
language, in its JRuby form, is available to the community of Java developers.
Finally, there is a possibility that  the Java platform may prove to be an
attractive deployment option for  existing Ruby applications in certain
scenarios.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Does this mean that Sun is still operating in a ”Java-only“
world?</h2>
<p>No.  We are actively interested in supporting non-Java technologies such
as PHP, Perl, Python, and Rails on our system and OS platforms.  And  we are
quite aware that many Solaris systems are running non-Java  workloads.  In
particular, I’m concerned about the slow progress on the next-generation
native Ruby engine and would like to help there too.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>Is Sun responding to  hype?</h2>
<p> Yes, if by “hype” you mean a genuine
groundswell of interest in the developer community; for example,  check Tim
O’Reilly's 
<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/08/programming_language_trends_1.html">book-sales</a> data.</p>
<h2 id='p-8'>Why JRuby and not Ruby on Rails?</h2>
<p>Rails is built on the Ruby language, and already (sort of) runs on JRuby.  It  may be
the case that it will run better on JRuby than  on the  native platform in
certain application scenarios. There are also things we can do to make JRuby
on Rails a compelling option, not the least of which is integrating Rails into
existing Java frameworks and applications.</p>
<h2 id='p-9'>Is Sun picking Ruby as the winner among dynamic languages?</h2>
<p>No.  PHP and Python and others are all strong players, and at Sun we’re
also working on Visual Basic (project 
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/tor/entry/semplice_keynote_demo">Semplice</a>)

<p>I’ve written
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/06/27/Dabble-DB">before</a> about
<a href="http://dabbledb.com/">Dabble DB</a>, about being an unabashed fan of
the people and company and technology.  Since I think transparency is
important, this is by way of disclosure: as of today I’m a shareholder in
Smallthought Systems.  After
I’d advised them not to take any investment money, and then advised them that
they should probably take the
<a href="http://www.ventureswest.com/">Ventures West</a> offer, I asked if I
could have a little piece of the deal, and everyone was fine with that, so
today I signed the papers and gave them the cheque.
I guess there may have been a little Vancouver home-side boosterism in my
wanting to do this but not that much; I think I’m gonna get my money back and
then some.</p>

<p>Check out this surprising piece:
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/hendel/entry/the_unbearable_lightness_of_being">The
unbearable lightness of being stateless</a>, by Ariel Hendel.  He starts with
wise words on asceticism and the business traveler, moves through
something called “Logical Domains” which can serve
as “surf bum domains”.  It seems to make sense and I had to go back and read
it again, because it was good, even though at the end of the day he is trying
to sell you a computer.</p>

<title>Cars and Publishing</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>While our car
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/09/09/User-Interfaces">was in the shop</a>,
we rented a van and it dawned on us that for a 2-child family that’s on the road
quite a bit, a van might be a better choice than either of the current
chariots, a tiny lovable Golf diesel or a slick but space-challenged Audi
wagon.
So we’re kind of car shopping.  As a side-effect of this process, I begin to
think that
<a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/">Consumer Reports</a> is maybe ahead
of the world in effective integrated publishing.</p>
<p>Lauren subscribes to their website for $26/year, and it’s just the thing when you
want to look up cordless drills or baby strollers.  The price seems fair,
maybe a little low actually, and the potential market of subscribers seems
almost infinitely large.
Since the site offers a task-oriented approach, why would you ever
subscribe to the paper version?</p>
<p>Doesn’t mean you wouldn’t buy paper.  In fact, I just bought this big thick
magazine, 192 pages for $6.99, <cite>Consumer Reports Cars</cite>, which
rates pretty well every mainstream car, SUV, and truck on the market, 264 in
total.  The subtitle, “Best &amp; Worst New Cars 2006”, is reassuring;
nothing adds more weight to a collection of reviews than some of them being
negative (<cite>CR</cite>’s best of 2006: the Audi S4 and BMW M3, tied.  The
worst: the Jeep Wrangler).</p>
<p>It’s a superb publication, with well-written articles in the front and
back about selling practices, new technologies, fuel efficiency, safety, and
so on.  Then the capsule summaries for each model are triumphs of effective
“get out of the way and let the information through” typesetting; and there’s
a <em>lot</em> of information. 
Computer display screens are years and years away from being able to achieve
this much information density and usefulness.</p>
<p>Once you’ve decided what you want to buy, they’ll sell you one-off
information packages about dealer cost, current supply and demand, and typical
financing packages specific to that model, for $14; delivery by mail or FAX.
For another $12 they’ll give you the seller’s-side view for your trade-in.</p>
<p>Of course, a key premise is that this whole thing is unpolluted by
advertising, <cite>CR</cite> has built a terrific reputation for integrity;
which in their case is a key to the business model.
And what a great business model; they work to assemble and produce
high-quality high-value information, and the customers buy it from them
directly.  No advertisers polluting any part of the pipeline.</p>
<p>I’m not naïve enough to claim that this is the future of publishing—after
all, the world needs advertising—but it sure is a refreshing change.</p>

<title>Cars and User Interfaces</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I can remember, back in the day, when we were arguing about user interfaces
we said “It should be as intuitive as a car is.  Any experienced driver can
get in a new, strange, car and figure it out in minutes.”  Well, I’ve been
using a bunch of different computers and driving a bunch of different cars
lately, and I think we’re there.  With a sad picture and some automotive
micro-reviews.</p>
<img src="IMG_4903.jpg" alt="Audi smashed by Mercedes" />
<p>What happened was, our nice Audi station wagon got into a fight with a
Mercedes M-class, and well, we didn’t win.</p>
<p>As a result, in the last month, we’ve driven, along with our own 2001
dieself Golf and the usual
business-trip rentals, two iterations of the Pontiac Montana van, my Mom’s
20-year old K car, and a Camry courtesy car from the body shop.</p>
<p>Normally I live on the Mac, but last month, I spent a few weeks in Ubuntu
land, plus I have to use a Windows box now and again to play a game or scan
some slides.</p>
<p>The computers are, by and large, an easier switch than the cars.  Yes, the
pedals and steering wheel and shifter are consistent, but getting the
windshield wipers to do what you want is a research project on every car,
as is setting the interior lighting and adjusting the audio for
bass, treble, and so on, and a bunch of other minor functions that you need to
do all the time.
But cutting and pasting and moving files and editing text and browsing the web
and reading mail and improving photos and so on, these days that’s all much of a
muchness, whatever computer you’re sitting in front of.</p>
<p>So, while we complain all the time about software interfaces, and that’s OK
because they could be better than they are, we’re really not doing that
badly.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Micro-Reviews</h2>
<p><i>Our Audi</i> (A4 station wagon with the 3.0l engine and a stick shift).  I love it,
it’s a truly great car except for the windshield wipers, it’s still in the shop,
sob.</p>
<p><i>Our Golf TDI</i>.  Unbelievably practical and well-designed for the
(low) price.   It’ll never outrun a Corvette, but it’s solid as a rock and
super-maneuverable and comfy and gets you there.</p>
<p><i>The Montana vans</i>.  Lots of well-designed stowage—really lots—and an
immense gas tank, so you can go a long way.  Pretty good pep, too.  But they wallow
along the road, galumph around corners, and lurch to a stop.</p>
<p><i>Twenty-year-old
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler_K_platform">K car</a></i>.  It
goes.  It almost never breaks.  It starts 
reliably in the Saskatchewan winter.  Its design was never very refined, and
after a couple of decades of Canadian Prairie weather, it has achieved a
disdain for mere appearance that approaches the monumental.</p>
<p><i>Recent Camry</i>.  What a great car.  Too bland for me, but it’s fast, it’s
lively, it’s comfy, it’s roomy, and it feels light and responsive.  I read that
it’s the best-selling car in North America, and I can see why.</p>
<p><i>Mid-size Ford/GMC/Chrysler boxes from rent-a-car companies</i>.  
Detroit is doomed.</p>

<title>Van Distortion</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We’re looking for a mini-van or equivalent, and it seems like the industry
really wants to sell us something less useful for more money.</p>
<p>While our Audi’s
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/09/09/User-Interfaces">been in the shop</a>,
two of the replacements were mini-vans, and we had an epiphany when we put in
the two kids in car seats and there was still room for luggage and camping
equipment.
So some sort of loaf-of-bread-shaped vehicle seems to be in our future.</p> 
<p>The invaluable
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/09/09/Consumer-Reports">Consumer Reports
Cars</a> makes a convincing case that the Toyota Sienna and Honda Odyssey are
pretty well the cream of the mini-van crop, with the Hyundai/Kia
Entourage/Sedona being worth a look.  The Toyota looks much nicer but they say
the Honda handles a 
little better and can turn off half its cylinders while cruising, to save
gas.  Not that either of them is a gas-saver.
They’re pretty reasonably priced though.</p>
<p>Well, I like cars and I like
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/01/01/Christmas2002">driving fast</a>, so I
wondered what was up-scale from the vans; something that might be a little
less ugly and a little faster and a little slicker.  The answer,
unfortunately, is SUVs.</p>
<p>I hate SUVs with a passion; I am not willing to spend a penny for the
ability to drive off-road because I don’t, and they’re ugly and pretentious
and overpriced and generally stupid.  But if you want to go upscale and still
want seven seats, you’re looking at an SUV.</p>
<p>There’s one interesting option, the Toyota Highlander, which you can get
with a hybrid engine that’s received good reviews and gives you good mileage
around town, which where we’d be, mostly.  But it’s got 38 cubic feet of cargo
volume compared to the Sienna’s 70.  Hrmph.</p>

<title>Making Markup Correctly</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’ve encountered three different Ruby libraries for generating markup:
there’s one
<a href="http://www.rubycentral.com/book/web.html">in the CGI library</a>,
there’s
<a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2006/01/04/creating-xml-with-ruby-and-builder.html">Builder</a>,
and there’s 
<a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/inspect/markabyForRails.html">Markaby</a>.
To some degree, all are heavily informed by the special case of generating
HTML; and maybe they’re OK for that.
But if you want to go further and generate XML, they’re all pointing in the
same, wrong, direction.
Maybe I’m missing something, but I do have an alternative to offer.  Plus, I
find a chance to laugh at myself gleefully.
<i>[Update: Ouch!  Refuted!] [Update: And again, more seriously.]</i></p>
<p><i>[Well, it turns out that I’m a Commuterrorist, my code is uglier than
goatse, and I’m the reason that Sun is the “zzz” in dot.biz.
<a href="http://chaoseffect.com/articles/2006/09/11/tim-bray-makes-markup-wrongly">Leon
Spencer says so</a>, very amusingly.  If you haven’t read this piece yet, stay
with me till the end, then I’ll link to him again and respond.  If you’ve been
here before and just want to see the update, jump to
<a href="#p-7">The Spencer Rant</a>.]</i></p>
<p><i>[Update: And again: Sam Ruby, who has more patience than I, shows that you
<a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/09/12/Dominion-and-Sovereignty">can use</a> the existing
XML::Builder framework to achieve the effect I was trying for.  He argues that
my effort would be better invested in fixing any flaws I find there than
inventing Yet Another Ruby XML Writer.  I think he’s right.]</i></p>
<p>All these markup generators adopt two principles:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You call a Ruby method to generate an element; it provides
the opening and closing tags and relies on a body to fill in the middle.</p></li>
<li><p>To generate a <code>&lt;foo></code> element, you call a
method named <code>foo</code>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>#1 is correct, and makes Ruby a really nice language for generating markup.
#2 is completely wrong in the general case.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Element = Method Fallacy</h2>
<p>Back when we were first doing XML, time after time someone would put up
their hand and say “Oh right, and then when you’re processing this stuff
you’ll dispatch the <code>&lt;foo></code> element to the <code>foo()</code>
method (or sometimes, the <code>foo</code> class)!  ”
This turns out not to work in the general case because <code>&lt;Tim.Bray/></code>,
<code>&lt;société/></code>, and <code>&lt;a-a_a/></code> are all perfectly
legal XML elements, and those names are awkward. Yes, Ruby does allow you to
have methods with funky names, but you have to do extra work to use them.
Also, you have to work around namespaces somehow.</p>
<p>This mistake is  particularly tempting in Ruby because it’s so easy to 
implement <code>method_missing</code> and say “Oh, they called
<code>foo</code>, did they?  Well, I’ll just slip in a <code>&lt;foo></code>.”</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>What Elements Really Are</h2>
<p>An XML Element has three ingredients: a namespace URI, a short name, and an
attribute list.  
(There are times when the programmer has to control the namespace prefix, due
to the bogosity of QNames-in-content.)
An attribute list has zero or more instances of name-value
pairs, where the name comprises a local part and an optional namespace
URI; the value is just a string.  Text in attribute values and element content
has to be escaped.</p>
<p>An XML-generating API that tries to fight against or work around this
objective reality is just fatally flawed, in my view.  So, can we cook up
something that is reality-based and also pleasant to use?  </p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Genx for Ruby</h2>
<p>The Ape needs to generate XML, and was going about it in a pretty ad-hoc
way.  So, to 
explore these ideas I cooked up a little library named <code>Genx</code>.
Code talks; here’s the Ape code for generating the HTML output.</p>
<pre><code> 1  @w = Genx::Writer.new
 2  @w.element(:html) do
 3    @w.element(:head) do
 4      @w.element(:title) { @w.text 'Atom Protocol Excerciser Report' }
 5      @w.nl
 6      @w.attributes =
 7        { :rel => 'stylesheet', :type => 'text/css', :href => '/ape/ape.css' }
 8      @w.element(:link)
 9    end
10    @w.nl
11
12    @w.element(:body) do
13      @w.element(:h2) { @w.text 'The Ape says:' }
14      @w.nl
15      if @header
16        @w.element(:p) { @w.text @header }
17        @w.nl
18      end
19      @w.element(:ol) do
20        @w.nl
21        @steps.each do |step|
...</code></pre>
<p>Notes, by line number:</p>
<p><b>2.</b> You’re not always going to be able to use Ruby’s
<code>:symbol </code>
thingies for element and attribute names, but where you can, it seems like a
good fit.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> In this case, the body all fits on one line.  I thought of
adding a convenience “content” argument to the <code>element</code> method for
this fairly-common case, but the idiom as it appears feels pretty natural.
See also lines 13 and 16.
The <code>text</code> method escapes its argument, of course.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> <code>nl</code> inserts a newline.  This is going to happen
a lot and it saves 7 characters over <code>text "\n"</code>.
You could try to get clever and arrange for the API to insert pretty-printing
line breaks for you, but down that path lies madness, and tossing in the
occasional <code>w.nl</code> hardly seems onerous.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> The <code>element</code> method actually takes up to three
arguments: the element name, the namespace, and a hash of the attributes.  But
that makes for long, awkward-looking calls that spill across lines; and
anyhow, you might want to re-use an argument list.</p>
<p>So the <code>attributes=</code> method sets the attribute-list for the next
<code>element</code> call; similarly <code>namespace=</code> sets the namespace.
Interestingly, <code>namespace=</code> is sticky but
<code>attributes=</code> is transient.  That is to say, you have to call
<code>attributes=</code> once per <code>element</code>.  This seems to work
well, since it’s common to spit out a bunch of elements in a row from the same
namespace, but rare to use the same attribute-list for successive
elements.</p>
<p><b>8.</b> This <code>element</code> has no body because 
<code>&lt;link></code> has no content.  The code will notice and generate
empty-element syntax.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Status</h2>
<p>This code is now what runs if you use
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ape/">the Ape</a>.
Next?  I’m not sure.  
I’m going to use this for my <i>[News flash: in progress]</i> 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> comment system, and that’ll force me to figure
out the right API.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Oops, I Did It Again!</h2>
<p>About the time I had the Ape running, an echo at the back of my brain (it’s
a vast empty space, there are lots of echoes) said “Didn’t someone already do
a Ruby wrapping for Genx?”</p>
<p>Well, what do you know,
<a href="http://genx4r.rubyforge.org/">Garrett Rooney did</a>.
And get this, here’s a little piece of his example code:</p>
<pre><code>  w.element("foo") do
    w.text("bar")
  end</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes, the right thing to do is obvious.</p>
<p>So maybe fiddling with Genx4r is the right thing to do.
On the other hand, I think that if you have a language and you want to write a
library for it, you should wherever possible write it in that language.  I
think this for a bunch of reasons, two of which are spelt CLR and JVM.</p>
<p>However, trying to make my current Ruby Genx general-purpose and reliable
would force me into going <i>mano a mano</i> with Ruby’s idiosyncratic notions
about strings and encodings and characters; for now it only really works with
UTF-8.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if I did pursue this work, I’d have the
quite-substantial C-language Genx test suite as a basis to work from, which
would be a major help.</p>
<p>Hmmm.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>The Spencer Rant</h2>
<p>When I read things like
<a href="http://chaoseffect.com/articles/2006/09/11/tim-bray-makes-markup-wrongly">Leon
Spencer’s fusillade</a>, it makes me regret being so careful what I write
here; I ought to allow myself the occasional explosion like that just for
fun.</p>
<p>Anyhow, Leon offers a Markaby example that emits the same HTML that
mine does while being quite bit more readable.
(In fact, it’s also quite a bit nicer than _why’s own example).</p>
<p>So, let’s grant the point; if you’re going to be working in an environment
where you’re sure you’re not going to have any odd-looking element names, and
you’re not going to have to wrangle namespaces, and you don’t mind the
framework deciding where it’s safe to put newlines in your markup, and you’re
not worried about element names colliding with well-known function names,
then, well hey.
So, am I a boring old
<a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.219431.12">factory
factory factory</a> fart wanting to inflict unnecessary pain and failing to
recognize the obvious 80/20 point here?  
Or will the pleasant buzz you get today from mapping markup into code maybe
give you a nasty hangover tomorrow?
Is it Truth vs. Beauty?  Is it Life vs. Art?  Is it
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0370263/">Alien vs. Predator</a>?
Oh, the anguish.</p>

Here’s a story of an

9/11 hero</a> that I hadn’t heard before.
I gather that our side has done a pretty good job of
getting the guys who organized it and breaking up their organization, but you
know, trying to fight a guerrilla movement by killing them one at a time has
never worked for anyone in any history books I’ve read.  
Bruce Schneier says what a lot of smart people are saying, that yes, this
<a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/09/more_than_10_wa.html">really
is a policing problem</a>.
It’s just everyone’s bad luck that the bad guys did the bad things at a time when the
U.S. administration contained what seems to have been an unusually high proportion
of feckless ideologically-blinded not-too-bright hacks.
Looking back in time, there are some things that make you shake your head
and think “That’s just completely crazy!”  History is full of them, from
Athens attacking Syracuse a couple of millennia back to 
Hitler attacking Russia within the memory of living people.  
It’s beginning to look like retaining Rumsfeld’s services will be seen as the

<body>
<p>Following on our
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/09/07/JRuby-guys">hiring the JRuby guys</a>,
I’ve had emails and links from representatives of pretty well every other
dynamic language:
<a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a>,
<a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>,
<a href="https://pnuts.dev.java.net/">Pnuts</a>, you name it.
All of them saying, more or less: “Why Ruby?  There are other languages which
are better (or better-integrated, or faster).”    Some of them would like jobs
(perfectly reasonable, we like getting that kind of email) and some of them
would like Sun to assign money and resources to their language project 
(we like to hear about those ideas, too).
So if you think those things should happen, I recommend looking at the JRuby
situation for lessons.  First, these guys took an existing semi-dormant project
and brought it alive, unprompted, unpaid, applying energy and
engineering skills to the problem in large quantities.  
Second, they were working in a field that
has a large and growing community; in this case because of the hype around
Rails.  Third, they were vocal and outward-facing and articulate, getting on
the stage at Java One and lots of other events with impressive demos.  Fourth,
they shipped code that worked pretty well and improved qualitatively from
release to release.  I’m not sure it’s Sun’s role to pick and choose the
winners and losers in this space, or anoint leaders; what would make us think
we’re that smart?  But when obvious leadership emerges in an interesting space, why
wouldn’t we get behind it?</p>

<title>On Innovation</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I really owe Nicholas Carr a vote of thanks; I believe no other single
individual has provoked so many <span class='o'>ongoing</span> entries of the
form “A is right about X” or “A is wrong about X”.  Today, Nick is
<a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2006/09/innovate_narrow.php">wrong
about innovation</a>.   To be fair, this is something that has driven
management practitioners and theorists crazy forever; the people running a
company tend to know pretty well where some innovation would be useful; adding
product value to give some price leverage; revamping manufacturing operations
to tie up less capital; it depends on the company’s pain point.  And that kind
of works, but only for the <em>little</em> innovations.  Maybe the best-known
example is 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen"><i>Kaizen</i></a>, as applied in the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System">Toyota
Production System</a>; which explicitly acknowledges that it’s chasing small,
incremental, steps forward.
But fortunes are made, and industry titans are built, where management isn’t
really looking, almost always.  The big pieces of innovation come out of
garages and low-rent offices in lousy locations, and they’re produced by
small groups without much management backing.  It <em>can</em> be done at big
companies (the business personal computer at IBM, Java at Sun) but then it’s
always in an off-the-mainstream skunkworks.
Nobody—I repeat, nobody—is smart enough to predict where the next big
strategic innovation is going to come from.  So if you “narrow your innovation
focus”, you’re almost guaranteed to miss it.  The best approach, I think, is a
combination of conscious focused incremental innovation—<i>kaizen</i>—combined
with a structure that’s loose enough that when someone wants to hide in a
corner and try something crazy, you don’t get in the way too much.</p>

the notion of using YouTube to deliver a fairly standard corporate marketing
piece just a little weird?  It’s convenient that venture caps are backing
startups that burn kazillions of bucks on bandwidth so that
large public companies can deliver video advertising for free.
Is it sustainable?  Weirder things have happened, I guess.</p>

<title>“Publish” Everywhere</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Atom, especially the Publishing Protocol, is moving into the evangelism
stage, since the committee work’s almost done and there are plenty of
implementations.  Here’s why I think Atom is important.  If you look at
<a href="http://www.sifry.com/alerts/">Dave
Sifry’s numbers</a>, the growth of the blogosphere is astounding; 
looking past all the fluff and chaff, there are somewhere
between five and ten million people out there who care enough to contribute to
the Net once a week or better.  
That may sound like a lot, but I don’t think it’s nearly enough.
Here at Sun, in a blogging-friendly tech-savvy culture, maybe 5% of the
people post regularly.  So I look at the number of people using the Net and I
wonder: “Why there aren’t 50 million, instead of five million, people contributing
every week?”  The answer: “Because it’s too hard”.  We can fix that.  Here’s
the Atom dream: <em>A “Publish” button on everything.</em>  On every word
processor and email reader and web browser and cellphone and PDA and
spreadsheet and photo-editor and digicam and outliner and sales-force tracker.
Really, <em>everywhere</em>.  If it doesn’t have a “Publish” button, it’s
broken.</p>

<title>Wikipedia: Resistance is Absent</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>What happened was, I went to check out the new Microsoft search engine at
<a href="http://www.live.com/">live.com</a> (it’s not bad), and I started by
looking for myself.  I was kind of surprised when my Wikipedia entry came in
ahead of <span class='o'>ongoing</span>.  (Wikipedia’s #2 at Google and
Yahoo.)
I’m seeing this pattern of Wikipedia inching up the search-result charts for a
whole lot of things.
Search-result rank, on the Internet, more or less equals Authority.  So this trend
has to worry the anti-Wikipedians.  It worries me too.  Maybe it could be
reversed, but I don’t think so.
<i>[Update: Byron Saltysiak 
<a href="http://www.bloglines.com/blog/byronsalty?id=5">suggests a more
positive aproach</a>.]</i>
</p>
<p>There’s an old saying in business: if you want to get credit, the first
thing you have to do is show up.  Let me rephrase that: if you want to have
authority on the Web, you have to show up on the Web.  And those who ought to
enjoy more authority than Wikipedia aren’t.
Let me make the point by example.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Tonight’s Assignment</h2>
<p>Let’s ask an interesting real-world question that real-world people might
ask: for each of the ten provinces of Canada, what is its population?
Let’s suppose you’re not a Canadian insider who knows that the Source Of All
Numbers is
<a href="http://www.statscan.ca/">Statistics Canada</a>. 
So, you could go to Wikipedia, which would be easy and quick.  From East to
West you’d look at
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfoundland">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfoundland</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Edward_Island">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Edward_Island</a>,
and, well, I’ll stop there, because the pattern is obvious.  On each of those
pages you’ll find the population, along with a lot of other basic facts,
presented crisply and legibly, no further steps required.</p>
<p>But you know, that’s just the Wikipedia; some joker might have gone in and
changed the number by couple hundred thousand up or down, just for fun.
Wouldn’t you be better off going to a source with some real
<em>authority</em>?
</p>
<p>I think you would.  And that authority would be, in each case, the
provincial government.
Well, the good news is that they’re easy to find.  Go to your favorite search
engine, type in “Government of Newfoundland” and you’re there in one
click.
Then the news gets bad; let’s go East to West.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfoundland">Newfoundland</a> is
poor start.  You have to go four clicks off the front
page, and it took me way more because the way to go isn’t obvious so I took
some side-trips.  Eventually you get to
<a href="http://www.stats.gov.nl.ca/Statistics/Population/">http://www.stats.gov.nl.ca/Statistics/Population/</a>,
but it doesn’t have the numbers, just links to a bunch of PDFs.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Edward_Island">Prince Edward
Island</a> also has a maze-like web site; once you find it, three clicks in is
<a href="http://www.gov.pe.ca/infopei/index.php3?number=5100">http://www.gov.pe.ca/infopei/index.php3?number=5100</a>
but, once again, the answer’s not there, just links back into Statistics
Canada.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia">Nova Scotia</a> could be worse: three fairly direct clicks to
<a href="http://www.gov.ns.ca/finance/statistics/agency/index.asp">http://www.gov.ns.ca/finance/statistics/agency/index.asp</a>
which actually has the number on it.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Brunswick">New Brunswick</a> Once again, three clicks to 
<a href="http://www.gnb.ca/cnb/nb/Pop-e.asp">http://www.gnb.ca/cnb/nb/Pop-e.asp</a>,
which gets straight to the point.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Québec">Québec</a> is better; I took one side-trip (perhaps due to weak French)
but it’s only two clicks to
<a href="http://www.gouv.qc.ca/portail/quebec/pgs/commun/portrait/demographie?lang=fr">http://www.gouv.qc.ca/portail/quebec/pgs/commun/portrait/demographie?lang=fr</a>,
which even provides a little commentary on the numbers.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario">Ontario</a> is a fairly straight three-click run, but the URL is frankly
astounding: 
<a href="http://www.gov.on.ca/ont/portal/!ut/p/.cmd/cs/.ce/7_0_A/.s/7_0_252/_s.7_0_A/7_0_252/_l/en?docid=EC001035">http://www.gov.on.ca/ont/portal/!ut/p/.cmd/cs/.ce/7_0_A/.s/7_0_252/_s.7_0_A/7_0_252/_l/en?docid=EC001035</a>,
and the page is full of anodyne marketing-speak, saying “With a population of
more than 12 million...”</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manitoba">Manitoba</a> is excellent: one click to
<a href="http://www.gov.mb.ca/faq.html#population">http://www.gov.mb.ca/faq.html#population</a>.
Hey, a FAQ page, what a concept.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a> only requires two clicks, but the first isn’t obvious
at all:
<a href="http://www.gov.sk.ca/aboutsask/">http://www.gov.sk.ca/aboutsask/</a>;
they call their FAQ page “Facts and Figures”.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta">Alberta</a> is one easy click:
<a href="http://www.gov.ab.ca/home/index.cfm?Page=2">http://www.gov.ab.ca/home/index.cfm?Page=2</a>
is a nice businesslike “Alberta facts” page.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia">British Columbia</a>, my own province, is awful; the front page has lots
of cheesy photos of the Premier but no useful facts-and-figures pointers, I
spent a few minutes poking around and gave up.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>The Right Answer</h2>
<p>It’s
<a href="http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo31a.htm">here</a>, but good
luck finding it.
I found it because it was (very quietly, easy to miss) linked from the Ontario population page.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Horrible URIs</h2>
<p>Cast your eyes back across those web addresses.  What are your chances of
guessing them?  Of remembering them?  Of writing them down accurately?  If you
bookmark them, how confident are you that they’ll be there after the next site
re-org?</p> 
<h2 id='p-5'>The End</h2>
<p>So if the public-sector community decided to standardize their URIs, or
adopt a principle that every front page should have a FAQ link, or make some sort
of concerted intelligent attempt to show up on the Web, they might grab some
authority back.  But they’re not.  And I don’t see any signs of interest.</p>
<p>So Wikipedia is going to win.  Do you see any other plausible outcome?</p>

<a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/09/15/cc-by-nc">Waiting for the

days.
Mark argues, and his argument seems awfully coherent to me, that the
“NonCommercial” option on Creative Commons is inconsistent with being an
Open-Source partisan.
I wonder if I’m weird, because I discover that my attitudes towards code and
non-code are different.  The notion of restricting anyone from <em>using</em>
code I contribute to feels entirely foreign, and if they want to use it
to make some money, good on ’em.  But I have <em>strong</em> negative feelings
about other people making money from my words or pictures without involving
me.  (Not that I or anyone else have actually made any real direct money from 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> fodder.)
In the time that 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> has been on the air, I’ve snarled a couple of
republishers off the air, without even thinking about it.  Call me a
greedhead.  And control freak.
That’s on top of being delusional about the potential value of these 
electrons.</p>

<title>Hot Kid, Tonto Woman</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’d kind of gotten off the book treadmill, what with trying to read the
Internet in real time.  But for some reason I’ve read a stack of books in
recent weeks.  One of them was
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hot_Kid">The Hot Kid</a> 
by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmore_Leonard">Elmore Leonard</a>,
who, Wikipedia tells me, has been publishing novels since before I was born.
It’s pretty good and, like every book Leonard’s ever written, has flows of
dialogue that pull you along and make you smile just at the joy of written
spoken English, done well.  It’s a pre-Depression gangster novel; the main
characters (and they’re all well-done) are synthetic, but Pretty Boy Floyd,
John Dillinger, Jay McShann, and other real people of the period hover around
the edges.  I enjoyed reading it but have a gripe; too much real dumbass
gunplay, a big piece of the flying-lead plot is about Our Hero’s
ability to draw faster than the bad guys.  Therefore, a pointer to
another Leonard, 1998’s <cite>The Tonto Woman and Other Western
Stories</cite>, a collection of nineteen short-form Westerns written
between the Fifties and Eighties.  The violence is implicit, threatened,
scary, off-stage, and very real, but it doesn’t happen much in the actual
narrative sequence.  The prose is amazingly lean; pared down almost to the
level of a <i>haiku</i>.  If you open this one up leave yourself two or three
hours before you go to bed, because you won’t be closing it.</p>

<p>I’m pretty busy with this and that but making good progress on the

comment submission/display system is easy, but even fairly

worth a certain amount of effort to avoid mandatory moderation.  
It’s all fairly
straightforward Ruby, no frameworks or databases or anything.  The only
downside is that I have to make a few adjustments to the current publishing
engine, which is Perl, and to the client-side stuff, which is of course
JavaScript.
I keep putting <code>:</code> in front of constant strings.  And forgetting
parentheses.  Especially empty parentheses.   
And semicolons.  Especially semicolons.  <em>Bloody stupid useless</em>

<p>We’re up to
<a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/draft-ietf-atompub-protocol-10.html">Draft
10</a> of the Atom Publishing Protocol, and it’s <em>very</em> close to what
the final product will look like.  The APP is getting more early developer support
and interop testing than any standards project I’ve ever been involved with,
and that includes XML.  DeWitt Clinton
<a href="http://blog.unto.net/atom/its-an-app-world-after-all/">covers
some of the bases</a>, but
<a href="http://rollerweblogger.org/roller/entry/atom_publishing_protocol_draft_10">Dave Johnson</a>
makes it nice and simple: “Atom
protocol can do everything that MetaWeblog API can do, and much more.”
On the subject of the Atom Feed Format, I don’t think much more needs to
be said, but the U.S. Intelligence community (which is quite feed-heavy
internally) commissioned a study:
<a href="https://dnidata.org/education/xnotes/RSS_and_Atom_Considerations.xml">RSS

<title>Who?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The concert calendar this fall features Paul Simon, the Rolling Stones, and
the Who; is it 1968 again?  I’ve seen ’em all and don’t feel much of an
urge to go back.  But then I thought of our seven-year old son, and about Roger
Angell, who writes beautifully for
<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/">The New Yorker</a>, often about baseball;
he was born in 1920 and has told about being taken, as a boy, by his dad to
see Babe Ruth play.  This feels like a direct living bridge to another epoch.
So I’m wondering if maybe I should scalp a couple of tickets 
so that when my little guy is an old man he can wow ’em with stories of having
seen the Who or whoever.
On which subject, I was driving around the other day and they played a couple
of songs from <cite>Who’s Next</cite>.  Anyone of my age has that music
permanently imprinted of course, but it’d been quite a while, and 
all these decades later, what stands out for me on those cuts is the
astounding, volcanic drumming.  Nobody has ever sounded like Keith Moon
before or since; he played like two men with three heads and six arms.  In
reviews of the latest Who tour, they say that Zak Starkey (Ringo’s son)
is channeling Keith remarkably, and that Townsend seems to be interested in
his guitar again.  Many years ago, last time I saw the Who, when they were singing
<i>Listening to you, I get the music</i> the stage went dark and the lights
all turned on the audience.  Impossible not to be moved.</p>

<title>Grass, Tea, Church, Search</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I gather there are people out there—lots of people—whose livelihood more or
less depends on their Google search rank.  Herewith some thoughts on why this
is scary.</p>
<p>First of all, check out this graph, computed on September 24th, 2006, of
the numbers of visits to <span class='o'>ongoing</span> via various search
engines.</p>
<img src="Image-Search-Mystery.png" alt="Search referrals, Sep. 2006" />
<p>Have a look at that “Google Images” line.  Its wild swings up and down have
been bothering me for a while now, and while I don’t have a complete
explanation, I do have some data.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Popular Pictures</h2>
<p>For quite some time,
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/08/30/SaskPhotos">Grass</a>, an 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> fragment from August 2004, was the most-read
page on the site, because the first picture there was one of the top results in a 
<a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=grass">Google Images
search for “grass”</a>.  There were a few other fragments with
similarly-elevated popularity, but <cite>Grass</cite> was the champ.
Then, sometime starting in the spring of this year, they Made Some Adjustments, and
quite a few of my pictures fell off the front page.  This accounts for a whole
lot of the decline in image-search referrals between April and August.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, I’ve noticed that
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/03/30/Teacup">Tea</a>
and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/03/17/Church">1921 Church</a>, both from this
last March, have become amazingly popular.  (For example, the <cite>Tea</cite>
page has been viewed 20+ times so far already on this slow Sunday morning.)
But neither shows up near the
top of Google Images.  I scratched my head and looked at the logfiles.
It turns out that if you do the image search starting at 
<a href="http://images.google.co.uk/">images.google.co.uk</a> (or
<a href="http://images.google.co.in/">.in</a>) rather than just
<code>google.com</code>, my tea-cup shot is third from the top, and the
prairie-church shot is #23, not even on the first page of results.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Aesthetics</h2>
<p>Normally I wouldn’t have much of an opinion about this; neither my income
nor my happiness is much related to how much Google likes my pictures.
But I am taken aback by the arbitrariness of it all.  I think that that
tea-cup is one of the prettiest pictures here, so it’s reasonable that it has
fans.  But I also think that the Saskatchewan-grass shot was good; better, in
fact, than quite a few things currently on the image-search front page.</p>
<p>But when I use Image Search myself to look for a picture of whatever, I
usually get pretty good results, so I guess I shouldn’t complain much.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Business</h2>
<p>But this does give me an appreciation for the stressful lives of those who live &amp;
die by their search rank.  I suppose that if I’d had a powerful idea for a
“grass”-related business (and we all know what Vancouver is famous for), I
could have been <em>rich, I tell you, rich</em>; but then the spring of 2006 would have
ended it all.</p>
<p>The stressful part is that I can’t control, or influence, or really even
understand the basis by which a picture is deemed good or not-good, and then
that decision shifts over time and place.</p>
<p>I think I’ll stay with software and evangelism for the moment.</p>

dropped by and they were sold out there too, but I totally recommend the

<title>5✭♫: Patti’s Gloria</title>
</head>
<body>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patti_Smith">Patti Smith</a> is
an interesting person and a fine musician, always worth listening to; I
particularly enjoy her recent recordings.  And in her 
youth, she recorded 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_%28Van_Morrison_song%29">Gloria</a>
by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Morrison">Van Morrison</a>; it’s a
contender for the best single-song rock performance ever.
<i>(“5✭♫” series introduction <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music">here</a>;
with <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music#p-1">an
explanation</a> of why the title may look broken.)</i></p>
<img src="Horses.png" alt="Cover of Horses by Patti Smith"  class="inline" />
<h2 id='p-1'>The Context</h2>
<p>Patti was a New York poet with chops, who came out of nowhere in 1975 on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horses_%28album%29">Horses</a>, 
featuring <cite>Gloria</cite>.  Her history is a long one, and I’m not going
to tell it all here, but you might enjoy reading up on her; she
toured and played with a lot of interesting people, then she retired from
music to raise a family, then her husband and brother died, then she got back
into the business.  I’ve not heard all her records, but have liked what I’ve
heard.</p>
<p>When our son was born in 1999, we didn’t get out much for a while.  The
first time we got a babysitter and went out, it was to see Patti in a big rock
&amp; roll ballroom. She was just totally beyond great.  We’d been away from
bars for many many months and in the interim the smoking ban had come in.
It was kind of disorienting; barroom ambiance, loud rock music, people
dancing, no tobacco (a modest amount of cannabis smoke drifting from the
corners though).  We went home exhausted but un-smelly and woke up clear-headed.</p>
<p>Patti’s been making records regularly since her return to the scene; I have
two of them,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gone_Again">Gone Again</a> and 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trampin%27">trampin’</a>, and I listen
to them quite a bit, <cite>trampin’</cite> especially.
It’s loud and uncompromising but still lyrical and lovely, which is a nice
trick if you can pull it off.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Music</h2>
<p>Patti’s <cite>Gloria</cite> is just under six minutes long and it’s not complicated.
Patti improved Van’s 
lyrics; she enters, snarling against a surging electric vamp: <i>Jesus died
for somebody’s sins, but not mine</i>.  Then for the next three hundred seconds or
so she rides the musical curve up and up and up into a Dionysian climax, and
ends with that same snarl about Jesus.
It doesn’t try, particularly, to be subtle or ironic or subtextual or any of
that crap; Patti just stays on the beat and pushes her voice and the band to
the edge and beyond, and if you play this loud enough your heart will be
racing and your head will be banging when they get to the top of the song.</p>
<img src="Patti-Smith.png" alt="Patti Smith" />

<p>Rock and roll played right (and Lord knows it doesn’t happen that often),
well there’s nothing else that comes close.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Sampling It</h2>
<p>I went to play the <cite>Horses</cite> CD to refresh myself in writing
this, and discovered to my horror that it’s not there on the shelves; nor is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Ethiopia">Radio Ethiopia</a>, in
either vinyl or silver.  So they must have fallen by the wayside, and the
track I’ve been headbanging to on airplanes must be classic-Napster fruit.
Well, I’m just going to have to go out and buy them; and you should too.</p>

<title>How Much Work?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Here are links to two explorations of the same question: why do we work the
amount we work?
<a href="http://strange.corante.com/archives/2006/09/24/eurofoo_working_a_four_day_week.php">Suw Charman recently
reported</a>
on a thought-provoking EuroFOO session by
<a href="http://www.carsonsystems.com/about.html">Ryan Carson</a>, who has
decided as a matter of policy to put his company on a four-day week.
Then today Brad DeLong
<a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/09/the_rainsoaked_.html">quotes
Robert Frank</a> on Keynes having been wrong about wealth and desire, but is
left unsatisfied, still wondering “Why 40 hours?”  Some of us, of course, have
vocations not jobs and are happily writing code and chatting with 
colleagues and blogging at 11PM.  But still... one would like the amount people
work to be explicable by rational economics.  DeLong doesn’t try, he veers
beautifully sideways into Cowboy Economics or rather Junkie Economics; well
anyhow, he quotes six verses of a song usually sung by Margo Timmins.
Which is a sane way to address a mystery.  But if I were going around
again, I think I’d be an economist.</p>

<title>Dynamic-Language IDEs</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I was reading Pat Eyler’s 
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/node/1000103">interview with the JRuby
guys</a> (that’s part 2, 
<a href="http://on-ruby.blogspot.com/2006/09/new-jruby-interview-part-1.html">Part
1</a> is good too); and I had an idea about building IDEs for dynamic
languages like Ruby.</p>
<p>IDEs do a bunch of nice things for you.
A lot of people think the nicest is
the refactoring support; check out Charles Nutter’s narrative in <a href="http://on-ruby.blogspot.com/2006/09/new-jruby-interview-part-1.html">Part
1</a> about
how it’s helped them in their work on JRuby.</p>
<p>The refactoring I use <em>all the time</em> is renaming, but there are lots
more.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Find Usages</h2>
<p>IDEs all have a “Find Usages” feature, which in itself is handy (“I’m
thinking of nuking this stupid method, where is it used?”) but if you think
closely, is also vital too pretty well every other refactoring operation.  If
you’re going to rename a method or a class or extract an interface, it’s
absolutely vital that the IDE know all the places where that code is used;
otherwise refactoring equals breakage.</p>
<p>Of course, the problem is harder with dynamic languages, because variables
aren’t declared, and because you can screw around with the insides of classes
at runtime, and for a bunch of other reasons that Thomas Enebo discusses in
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/node/1000103">Part 2</a>.</p>
<p>Thomas points out that, for refactoring, “open definitions and detecting
callers, etc., will only be accurate if you are actually running the
code. Which is something you really don’t want your IDE/editor to do”.</p>
<p>Well, I thought about that, and I realized that in fact, my IDE runs my
code all the time.
Another thing that IDEs make easy is unit testing, and competent programmers
take advantage of this and are hitting the “run tests” button every time they
change anything, just to make sure they haven’t broken anything.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Unit Testing and Learning</h2>
<p>So I wonder about bolting a bunch of apparatus on the side of the unit-test
runner.  Because when the test is running, if the IDE can peek inside the
run-time, it’ll be able to tell exactly which types get assigned to which
variables and which method-calls go where.</p>
<p>So I’m thinking of the IDE doing this and then persisting the information,
so that whenever you’ve got your cursor on a variable, it has a chance to look
at the last test-run cookie crumbs and figure out what that variable contains.
The effect would be, the better your unit-testing coverage, the smarter your
IDE would be, and the more useful auto-complete would be, and the more
refactoring would be possible.
Is that a virtuous circle or what?</p>

<p>On the weekend, we visited Steveston, a touristy little waterfront town in

&amp; chips on a floating dock at the west end of town.  Good fish &amp; chips
are not that easy to find.
The waterfront was formerly industrial (fish-canning mostly) and is becoming
recreational/residential.  But there are a lot of old wooden pilings left in in the
water.</p>
<p>As you can see, they’re not idle; each one is put to good use by
opportunistic vegetation and wildlife.</p>

<title>Practical Transparency</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A few days ago, our CEO Jonathan Schwartz 
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/one_small_step_for_the">sent a
letter</a> to SEC Chairman Christopher Cox calling for SEC
financial-disclosure regulations to allow for publishing material financials
on the Web.
It’s obviously a good idea, but there are some implementation issues.
(Hey, I’m an engineer, I can’t help it.)</p>
<p>It seems self-evident that the Web ought to be at least as good as the
traditional vehicles (press releases, telecons) at getting important business
news out to everyone at the same time.
But for any really material information, we’ll need a commitment to a little more
than 
“posting it on the Web site”.
Where on the web site?  And does the world get
any help in noticing that it’s arrived?</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Need For Feed</h2>
<p>It’s no accident that Jonathan wrote specifically of posting to a blog.
Because a blog has an RSS feed, and people who want to follow the news
can subscribe to it, and they’ll find out if anything shows up
there.  I’d say that if a company plans to release information on the Web, at
a minimum you’d want to require that it appear at a well-known location, and
that that location have a feed.  I’d further urge that an Atom 1.0 feed be
required; it’s a stable Internet Standard and you really don’t want to have to
worry about the RSS propensity for
<a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2004/05/28/detente">silent data loss</a>.
</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Need For Speed</h2>
<p>Even a nice clean well-known feed doesn’t quite solve the whole problem.
Your typical feed-reader is set up to poll every half-hour or even less often, and there
are those in the financial community who are not going to be happy with
a potential half-hour’s latency in getting the news.</p>
<p>I can think of one simple brute-force way to approach the problem, and
another that’s a little more sophisticated.
The simple solution is, assume that everyone who really cares will want to
poll that material-news feed every few seconds.  So, you stage Jonathan’s
feed, not on the ordinary blogging infrastructure, but on a hyper-fast cache
that can take that kind of transaction load; there might even be a business
opportunity here for some infrastructure player to offer this kind of
special-purpose staging.</p>
<p>If you want to get fancy, you could use something like the proposed new
<a href="http://www.xmpp.org/drafts/draft-saintandre-atompub-notify-05.html">Atom-over-XMPP</a> trick.  The idea is that people who want ultra-low-latency
feeds don’t poll, but set up a persistent connection to the provider’s server,
which pushes entries down the wire the moment they become available.
This is elegant in theory; in practice I’d bet on the
brute-force polling approach, at least off the top.</p>

<title>Transparent Business</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I spent a couple of fascinating hours Tuesday at a round table hosted by the United States
<a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2006/2006-166.htm">Securities and
Exchange Commission</a>.  The subject was
<a href="http://www.sec.gov/spotlight/xbrl.htm">Interactive Data</a>, a term
which is hardly self-explanatory but really means “Business Transparency”.
This in the
same week that Jonathan 
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/one_small_step_for_the">sent a
letter</a> on the same subject to SEC Chairman
<a href="http://localhost/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/04/SEC">Christopher
Cox</a>, who was also around the table.
Mr. Cox and the SEC are definitely on the right track; I expect bumps in the
road, but there’s a chance that Accounting As We Know It could be blown up.
Which would be a good thing; and not just because Open Source is creeping in.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Interactive Data?</h2>
<p>When they say this, they really mean 
<a href="http://www.xbrl.org">XBRL</a> (Extensible Business Reporting
Language), an XML dialect designed for encoding companies’ financial
statements.
This rebadging, I am told, is Chairman Cox’s idea, and you can see
his point; “XBRL” is neither euphonious nor compelling as a rallying cry.</p>
<p>The SEC wants public companies to replace the current practice of financial
reports being big fat globs of unstructured heavily-footnoted text by an
alternate reality in which they’re clean structured detailed machine-readable
edifices of transparent truth.  What’s not to like?</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Sidebar: Washington Surprises</h2>
<p>I’ve done a lot of business in That Nation’s Capital over the years, and to
be honest I love it.
Yeah, it’s slow and process-bound and infected with cronyism and worse things too,
but at the end of the day they’ve got their arms, up to the elbows, in the stuff
of reality.  And it can surprise you.</p>
<p>Chairman Cox and his SEC surprised me too.  He looks like the Republican
insider he is;  the haircut, the suit, the jaw, the smile.  
A lot of West Coast geeks would be apt to blow all this off as
old-school or right-wing or “Enterprisey” or whatever.
Which would be silly; Cox’s SEC is
taking steps to drag business reporting into the cold 
clear light of truth by way of what he calls Interactive Data
and I call XBRL, but the name isn’t the thing; and the parallels to the
Open-Source world-view are not exactly subtle.</p>
<p>Oh yes, Open Source; among other things, the SEC is putting its money
into some.  Although it’s not perfectly clear in
<a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2006/2006-158.htm">this press
release</a>, a substantial part of that $500K worth of software will end up as
Open Source. 
That’s my kind of Republican.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Sidebar: On Accounting and Evil</h2>
<p>It’s fashionable, in technology circles, to diss lawyers.  Not here; I’ve
been doing business for 25 years and while I’ve frequently complained about my
legal bills, I’ve long since come to appreciate how essential attorneys are to the
process of getting things done.</p>
<p>My <i>bête noire</i> has always been the practice of accounting.  The
reality is that in any given industry segment, exactly half of the
companies are doing worse than average.  Their management teams 
are highly motivated to conceal the truth.  All too often,
they find Generally Accepted Accounting Practices helpful.
A certain part of the deep complexity and abstraction in accounting theory is in
fact there to reflect business reality; but I’m convinced that another
part of it is there to serve as a carpet under which to sweep
inconvenient truths.</p>
<p>Attempting to impose accounting formalisms on business reality is always
going to involve compromises and various kinds of twisty little passages, but
some of those passages lead to the Dark Side, and I’ve seen companies go
there.
At a company I co-founded, we had to fire a CEO for “revenue
recognition problems”.  To those who don’t know what that means: keep it that
way as long as possible.  To those who do: XBRL is a tool that might turn turn
out to be <em>real useful</em> in fighting the bastards who do this kind of
thing.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Back to Interactive Data</h2>
<p>Anyhow, here’s the dream: right now, if you know the name of a company, 
you can be pretty sure that by visiting
<code>www.</code>company-name<code>.com</code> you can find the basics: 
where the offices are, who the CEO and Directors are, and so on.</p>
<p>I imagine a future in which you can go to <code>xbrl.</code>company-name<code>.com</code> and be
pretty sure of finding authoritative machine-readable financial data.
And in this picture, 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_Law">Metcalfe’s Law</a>
applies in more than one way: not only does the value of the financial data
increase as a strong function of how many companies are providing it, but the
pressure to join in does too, on those companies who aren’t providing it.</p>
<p>XBRL ain’t perfect; they made no particular effort to hit any 80/20 points,
so it’s big and sprawling and taxonomist-ridden and it tries to Solve the Whole
Problem.
In this particular case, I claim that the information is so valuable that it’s worth fighting
through all this and finding a way to make it work.</p>
<p>In this vision, it‘s a whole lot harder for a management team gone bad
to turn a decent company into a den of thieves.</p>
<p>Done right, the impact of XBRL oops Interactive Data could dwarf that of
RSS and Atom put together.
I’m on board, and anyone who believes “truthful business” isn’t necessarily an
oxymoron should be too.</p>

<title>Web Hacking With Real Money</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Looking for some new data for your next mash-up?  How about playing with
real money?  The U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission’s
<a href="http://www.sec.gov/spotlight/xbrl.htm">Interactive Data
Initiative</a> has an
<a href="http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/xbrlrss.xml">RSS feed</a> of company
financial filings; not just the text, but in a highly-structured XML format
called
<a href="http://www.xbrl.org/">XBRL</a>.  I glance at the feed this morning and
see data from ADP, Dow Chemical, Molina Healthcare, Xerox, GE, Infosys, 3M,
Bristol Myers Squibb, and lots more.
XBRL isn’t the world’s easiest format to grok; that’s partly because
the formalisms that govern accounting are non-trivial in the extreme.  But I’m quite
sure there are fortunes to be made by people who combine hacking chops with
financial savvy, and figure out how to automate digging insight out of
this data.  Of course, in most gold rushes, the best business angle is selling
tools and entertainment to the miners; so there is obviously more than one
way to work this territory.  And a great big tip of the hat to the SEC for
getting this stuff on the air.</p>

<title>On Comments</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’ve had comments running for a few days here now (I prefer to say
“contributions”, but whatever).  People are irritated at me because an
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> fragment shows up as unread in their
feed-reader whenever a new comment comes in.  I’m not sure what the right
thing to do is.  This piece outlines a few options and asks the community for
discussion.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Options</h2>
<p>Here are some of the things that could be done when a new comment is
contributed:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Change the feed entry’s <code>updated</code> timestamp.</p></li>
<li><p>Include the comment count in the entry’s <code>summary</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Include the comment count in the entry’s <code>content</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Include the comments themselves in the entry’s
<code>content</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Build a per-entry comments feed.</p></li>
<li><p>Build a global <span class='o'>ongoing</span> comment feed (this
already exists, I just haven’t figured out where to point to it from).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Any others that I’ve missed?  I’ll add plausible suggestions to
the list above.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Discussion</h2>
<p>Have at it in the comments, but if you want to say something long and
linky, you might want to do it in your own web-space and leave a pointer.</p>
<p>(Oh, by the way, comment authoring is apparently broken in IE6.  I really
must get around to fixing that, but for the moment go grab the nearest Firefox
if you’re an IEnaut.)</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>My Feelings</h2>
<p>When I update a fragment, I always bump the <code>updated</code> field and
put a notice in the summary so it’ll show up in the feed; I can suppress this,
but I have to push a special button; the default is to show the change.
To me, it seems really arrogant to do this for my own changes but not for
the contributions of others.</p>

<p>This is the latest paperback from 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gaiman">Neil Gaiman</a>.
I read it on the plane back from DC and it’s good enough that I had to
sit up late doing some work that I’d planned for the plane.  Gaiman’s novels
don’t Shift the Mass Understanding Of The Human Condition or Plumb The Depths
Of Postmodern Subtextuality, but the people in them are always real interesting and
the things that happen to them are entertaining and plausible (well, in the
sense that stories which routinely involve gods and alternate universes and
the working of magic can be plausible).
He’s got a 
<a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/">decent blog</a> too.</p>

<title>Grief Lessons</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is a recent book by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Carson">Anne Carson</a>, a poet and
scholar of whom I’d previously never heard.  The subtitle is “Four Plays by
Euripides”.</p>
<p>I read about it in some magazine, picked it up since I’m a 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/10/27/Xeonophon">sucker for the classics</a>,
and I’m glad I did.  The prefaces and interludes by Ms Carson are quirky and
interesting and worth reading, but not nearly as good as the four plays
translated between them:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heracles_%28Euripides%29">Herakles</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hecuba_%28play%29">Hekabe</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippolytus_%28play%29">Hippolytos</a>,
and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcestis_%28play%29">Alkestis</a>.
They are tragedies, and three of the
four are particularly tragic tragedies, with vengeful gods stirring a thick
brew of incest, madness, and murder.</p>
<p>But the words are stripped down and
stripped down and stripped down again, their edges left sharp as those on the
swords that shed the blood, and there’s lots of that, albeit mostly offstage .  
Herakles and Theseus
appear regularly, the profound ambiguity of their personalities and
semidivinity milked frankly for all it’s worth by both Euripides and
Carson.  Suffice it to say that you would not want to have
been a member of either’s family.</p>
<p>On top of the fine writing and translating here, the book is very
beautiful; plays-in-verse give the typographer many opportunities
for necessarily-careful exuberance, and the words are sprinkled on the paper
sparely and very beautifully.</p>
<p>I’m sure I’ll be picking up a couple of Anne Carson’s books now.
I already have enough Euripides.</p>

<title>On Comments (II)</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Thanks, everyone, for the high-quality
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/06/On-Comments#comments">discussion and suggestions</a> about 
comments and dates and updates and so on; if this were an IETF Working Group,
I’d be comfy declaring “rough consensus”.
I’ve made the obvious changes; herewith a description, along with general
remarks on how this whole commenting thing is going.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>How’s It Going?</h2>
<p>Great!
So far, I’m very pleased with the quality and tone.  For
example, if you cared about my piece 
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/09/29/Dynamic-IDE">Dynamic-Language IDEs</a> 
or the follow-up 
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/02/Cedric-on-Refactoring">Oooh,
Cédric</a>, I guarantee that you want to go back and read the comments on
each; you’ll learn more about the ins and outs of this (important) subject
than you would have from my original posts.</p>
<p>Also appearing in the comments have been 
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/04/SEC#c1160168501.649970">pointers
to interesting open-source projects</a>,
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/05/Intelligent-Search#c1160157554.298177">rejoinders
from technology insiders</a>, and 
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/07/Sorry-Pedro#c1160310813.210575">humor</a>.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>That Last Discussion</h2>
<p>Craig Andera

“About the only time comments are interesting in a feed to me is when I've
left one and I want to keep tabs on the responses”.  Gack.   I disagree.</p>
<p>Dare Obasanjo 
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/06/On-Comments#c1160164894.13223">suggests</a>
(along with others) using 
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4685.txt">Atom Threading Extensions</a>,
so I have.  I’ve implanted <code>replies</code> links and
<code>thr:in-reply-to</code> wherever it seems to make sense.</p>
<p>Antone Roundy, and others,
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/06/On-Comments#c1160164922.839497">point
out</a> the problems with per-entry comment feeds; namely, that various
idiotic clients will poll each and every one regularly from now until the heat-death of the
universe and there’s no way to stop them; given the volume at which I post,
this  would be untenable.</p>
<p>Sam Ruby
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/06/On-Comments#c1160165685.54652">argues</a>
that you shouldn’t mark an entry updated for new comments unless the comments
are right there in the entry; and also urges consideration of
<code>atom:author</code> and <code>atom:rights</code>.  Can’t see anything to
disagree with.</p>
<p>Justin Watt
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/06/On-Comments#c1160169877.474713">asks</a>
why I haven’t joined in the discussion in the comments.  I’m not going to say that
I’ll never do that, but at the moment I’m disinclined; the 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> fragments are my space, 
the comments are for the rest of
the world, and I’d rather not get in the way.</p>
<p>Paul Hoffman
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/06/On-Comments#c1160173201.351131">suggests</a>
“Feel free to update a posting with ‘There was an interesting comment about
...’ That’s you adding content to your own blog.”
That’s the right answer, I think.</p>
<p>Postmodern Sass
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/06/On-Comments#c1160184972.769047">wonders</a> why I’m adding comments now 
after three years without them.  The primary influence was probably
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan">Jonathan Schwartz</a>; I thought it
would be just crazy for him to turn on comments but he did anyhow, and it’s
worked out pretty well.</p>
<p>Sam Ruby checked back in to, among other things,
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/06/On-Comments#c1160223854.380904">complain
politely</a> about my cowardly insistance on moderation.  Cluck cluck cluck.
I’ll give it a try, but I need a couple more defense perimeters
in place.  Also  I need tool for efficiently mass-deleting comments
in large numbers, because I’m not going to win every round in the fight with
the spammers.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Rough Consensus</h2>
<p>The vast majority of people are irritated when the arrival of a comment
causes their newsreader to flag an item as updated.  Also, they want a comment
feed of some kind.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>What I’m Doing</h2>
<p>There’s now a global <span class='o'>ongoing</span> 
<a href="/ongoing/comments.atom">comment feed</a>.  It’s still a
work-in-progress and has at least one escaping (sigh) bug.</p>
<p>The number of comments is still shown on the
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> front page, and I think that’s OK, but neither
<code>atom:updated</code> nor the summary nor the content are touched.</p>
<p>I will, when I think a comment is particularly material and interesting,
update the top of the entry to say so, in such a way that it shows up in the
feed and summary; exactly in the way I’ve already been doing in response to
interesting comments, either via email or on other blogs.
If the experience so far is any guide, you can expect this to happen a
lot.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>To-Do List</h2>
<p>The most important to-do is to chase out a few lingering escaping bugs.
I’ll keep on tinkering with anti-spam defenses, but I admit to severe
nervousness about dropping the moderation; and I have to say, at this point
the conversation doesn’t feel broken.
Finally, I should improve the comment-authoring setup.  I’d really like to
avoid writing any code; there are all sorts of cool WYSIWYG-ish
comment-writing tools  out there, so I’ll try to put one to use here.
In the meantime, I encourage people to write comments in the comfort and
safety of their own blog, and just drop pointers into my comments.</p>
<p>Oh, and I really <em>must</em> fix whatever is stopping people using IE6
from seeing the “please contribute” message.  It’s actually pretty amusing, whenever
I say this to people face-to-face, the reaction is usually “yeah, whatever”
(as in, they don’t use IE), except when it’s “who cares what IE users think?”
I do.  I’ll get on it.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>The Software Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Since I’ve been writing <span class='o'>ongoing</span>, the code that I
write has been a fruitful generator of blog prose.  Not this time; the thing
works more or less as
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/05/15/Comment-System">outlined here</a>.
My take-aways: It’s nice working in Ruby; no frameworks required; no
databases required; XMLHttpRequest sure is handy.  But I’ve said those things lots already.</p>

<p>Today was Thanksgiving in Canada.  It’s hard to imagine anyone not liking
this New-World-only holiday; we all have lots to give thanks for and
dedicating a day to acknowledging it has to be a good thing.  Along with the
big things, a couple of small thanks-worthy events.  First,
at the outstandingly-beautiful
<a href="http://www.city.vancouver.bc.ca/parks/golf/qepp/index.htm">Queen
Elizabeth Park Pitch &amp; Putt</a>, I hit a hole-in-one at the tenth.  All of 70 yards,
mind you, and completely level, but still.  And later on, I undertook
management of the turkey and the dressing and the veggies on my own for the
first time ever, and they came out not too bad at all.  I also got a successful
gravy-making lesson from Peter Sharpe.
Then there’s the family and the weather and the job and all that other stuff
too.  Dear Universe: thanks!</p>

<title>5✭♫: Brahms’ First &amp; Haydn Variations</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>If I were asked to pick my favorite symphony, well, I couldn’t.   If I were
backed into a corner and really pressured, I still couldn’t.  But if it were a
matter of life and death and I were making short lists, 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._1_%28Brahms%29">Symphony No.
1</a> by 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Brahms">Brahms</a> would be
on all of them.   Some have argued that the <cite>First</cite> isn’t really his first symphonic
work; that would be
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variations_on_a_Theme_by_Joseph_Haydn">Variations on a Theme of Haydn</a>.  
Which, if granted, might not change my answer. 
<i>(“5✭♫” series introduction <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music">here</a>;
with <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music#p-1">an
explanation</a> of why the title may look broken.)</i></p>
<img class="inline" src="Johannes_Brahms.png" alt="Johannes Brahms" />
<h2 id='p-1'>The Context</h2>
<p>There’s not that much in the way of soul-clenching drama or hidden secrets
around Johannes Brahms.  When you’re talking about Dead Germans who wrote Big
Symphonies, he’s the one after Beethoven, alphabetically and
chronologically.  He was called old-fashioned in his lifetime, and there’s
nothing in his work that challenges the ear.</p>
<p>Even people who think his music is boring have admired the orchestration and
the incredibly-lush sonic textures.
I personally like the Big Serious Works, but 
he wrote lots of popular waltzes and <i>lieder</i> and of course the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahms%27_Lullaby">Lullaby</a> that the
tacky mobile we fasten onto my baby daughter’s crib plays when you wind it up.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Music</h2>
<p>Millions, probably, of incredibly erudite words have been written about the
<cite>First</cite>; I don’t think I have much to add, so I’ll keep this short.
<i>Item</i>: The
structure is formal, but that doesn’t get in the way of a whole lot of really
outstanding melodies.
<i>Item:</i> It sounds best played really, <em>really</em>, loud.
<i>Item:</i> Especially the whole first movement and the whole last movement.
<i>Item:</i> I hate it when classical music leaves you wondering “Is this the
end?  Is the music actually over?”  Brahms doesn’t; he uses lots of
exclamation points and draws a line under it and there is absolutely no doubt.
<i>Item:</i> The last movement quotes Beethoven’s <cite>Ode To Joy</cite>.
Someone pointed out the similarity to Brahms and he said “Any ass can hear
that”.  Except for, Brahms orchestrates the strings better.
<i>Item:</i> Those big slow <em>slow</em> horns in the last movement; oh my
goodness.</p> 
<p>Then there’s the <cite>Haydn Variations</cite>; if you define “Symphony” to
mean “Large-scale orchestral work constructed on formal principles”, this
would be one.  It’s formal all right, way out in Bach territory; and the big
central melody is plenty strong enough to hold up all the formal diddling with
no observable stress or strain.
Then that last variation comes around and neatly sums up all the chopping and
changing in a tone of cool triumph.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Sampling It</h2>
<p>It’s easy to say “Don’t even think about downloading this, go buy a good CD
or two”; but not so easy to say which recording.  The good news is that both
of these are hard to screw up.  For the <cite>Haydn Variations</cite>, the
choice is pretty clear:
<a href="http://www.mercurylivingpresence.com/">Mercury Living Presence</a>
434 326-2, <cite>Dorati Conducts Brahms &amp; Enesco</cite>, which also has
Brahms’ fine <cite>Hungarian Dances</cite> and Enesco’s <cite>Roumanian
Rhapsody No. 2</cite>.  Magnificent.</p>
<p>As for the Symphony, though, I don’t know.  I have a Giulini/Wiener
Philharmoniker CD on
<a href="http://www.deutschegrammophon.com/">Deutsche Grammophon</a> that has
both the <cite>First</cite> and the <cite>Haydn</cite> and it’s pretty
good.</p>
<p>But over the years, I’ve probably listened most of all to 
<a href="http://www.emiclassics.com/phpNewSite/home.html">EMI Classics</a> 7
54286 2, also pairing the <cite>First</cite> and the <cite>Haydn</cite>,
featuring
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Norrington">Roger Norrington</a>
and the London Classical Players.  Norrington is famous for “Original
Instruments” recordings, and indeed, the orchestras of Brahms’ time were
smaller and thinner than today’s.  Since Brahms’ music is big and thick, I
suspect that a well-done modern performance is probably a better choice.  But
Norrington’s take is incredibly transparent and intense and well-recorded, and
I love it.</p>

<p>There’s this new tech-news site,
<a href="http://www.infoq.com/">InfoQ</a>; they say they’re tracking
the “enterprise software development community”.  Somewhat along the same lines
as
<a href="http://www.theserverside.com/">TheServerSide</a>; but along with
Java, InfoQ covers .NET, Ruby, SOA, and Agile.  They’re currently running an

It’s <em>immensely</em> long; I took a look but my attention wandered
after ten minutes or so; I’m not sure even my Mom would last through the whole
thing.
As to InfoQ, they’re addressing a pretty big space, and now that traditional
technology journalism has been blown up, I’m 100% in favor of anyone who’s trying to
make new models work.

<title>The Money Statement</title>

<p>Somewhere in the code running inside our big HP household printer (and, I
suspect, every other printer on the planet) there’s a line of code, something
along the lines of <br/>
<code>if (drum_age > drum_warning_level)<br/>
  display BuyNewDrumWarning</code><br/>
Well, that warning message comes up awful early.  And it dawns on me that the
value chosen for <code>drum_warning_level</code> has an impact on HP’s cash
flow that’s measured in billions: smaller value, more money.  
And the temptation to move it down and then down again over the years, that’d
be irresistable.</p>

<title>Speedometer Suspicion</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I pulled the rental onto the Virginia highway and saw no other cars, so I stomped
the gas and enjoyed the kick.  That particular Malibu seemed well set up and
the needle headed for sixty pleasingly fast.  A little too pleasingly, maybe.
It occurred to me that automakers have a systematic bias in favor of making their
speedometers lie, on the high side of course; it makes the customers happy and the
police happy and probably saves some lives.  For rentals, bought a
fleet at a time, the pressure would be higher.  I wouldn’t be surprised if
some Operations-Research wonk in a back-room at Hertz or Avis or somewhere has
done the numbers: for every mile per hour of positive error on the dial, so many
fewer accidents, so many tens of millions of dollars of savings in repair bills, so many
dozen fewer lawsuits.  Plausible?</p>

<title>Ruby String Walking</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>In preparation for my presentation next weekend at
<a href="http://www.rubyconf.org/agenda.html">RubyConf</a>, I’ve been poking
around at Ruby’s string-handling.   One thing that text-wranglers such as
me like to do is walk through a string a character at a time, and Ruby doesn’t
make this particularly easy.
I ended up
implementing <code>String#each_char_utf8</code> three times along the way.
<i>[Update: Lots of interesting feedback, and a worth-reading
<a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.ruby.general/177147/focus=177147">ruby-talk
thread</a>.]</i></p>
<p>I poked around in the <code>ActiveSupport::MultiByte</code>
 (I can’t get it
to work on my computer, but I can read the source).
It appears that the only way to look into a Ruby string and see Unicode
characters is with <code>unpack('U*')</code>, or using a regexp with
<code>$KCODE</code> set to <code>'u'</code>.</p>
<p>So, I want to go walking through a string, looking at the Unicode
characters.
Maybe I’m parsing a big XML file using <code>mmap(2)</code> or some such.
What I want is an efficient <code>String#next_char</code>.
This will be hard in Ruby in the general case because Strings don’t know
what encoding they’re in; there’s <code>$KCODE</code> but that’s only defined
to work with regular expressions.  So let’s look at the special case of
UTF-8.</p>
<p>Of course, if <code>String#unpack</code> took a block like
<code>String#gsub</code>, that would give you the tools you need.  I looked at
<code>pack.c</code> and it would be real work, but it doesn’t look
architecturally impossible.  Failing that, let’s use <code>unpack</code> anyhow:</p>
<pre><code><![CDATA[def each_utf8_unpack(s, &block)
  s.unpack('U*').each &block
end]]></code></pre>
<p>The above sucks for big strings because you create a monster array of
integers.  Regular expressions are maybe a little more efficient
(this depends on the <code>$KCODE</code> setting, obviously):</p>
<pre><code>def each_utf8_regex(s)
  s.gsub(/./m) do |c|
    yield c.unpack('U').shift
    ''
  end
end</code></pre>
<p>The <code>unpack</code> voodoo is because I want the integer value of the
Unicode character.</p>
<p>Here is a more ambitious version, extending <code>String</code> and picking
the UTF-8 apart a byte at a time:</p>
<pre><code><![CDATA[class String

<p>Bob Sutor and Rob Weir (both of IBM) have been been whacking away at the
standards lipstick being painted on the Microsoft Office Internal Data
Structure XML Dump pig.  Oops, officially, that’s “ECMA Office Open XML”.
In 
<a href="http://www.robweir.com/blog/2006/10/leap-back.html">A Leap Back</a>
Rob describes Excel’s well-known
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/06/16.html">date-representation
bug</a> being encoded in an alleged International Standard.  Then 
again in
<a href="http://www.robweir.com/blog/2006/10/bit-about-bit-with-bits.html">A
bit about the bit with the bits</a>, he talks about bitmasks and offal
(really).
But it’s Bob’s point, in
<a href="http://www.sutor.com/newsite/blog-open/?p=1145"> Is Open XML a one
way specification for most people?</a>, that’s central: this is just a
six-thousand-page data dump describing a particular XML serialization of a
particular commercial application’s object model, completely oblivious to the
universe of publishing-related standards that have been hammered out and put
to work while MSOffice was being tended in Redmond.   You can write “STANDARD”
on it in letters as big as you want, but there will only ever be one full
implementation, and if you standardize on this standard you’ve locked yourself
in.
Shame, shame on the other companies on the committee, helping Microsoft
perpetuate this travesty.

<title>The Greatest Show on Earth</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Here in Canada, American politics is a spectator sport; and this year our
southern neighbors are putting on a terrific show.
The Washington machinations get further and further into
you-couldn’t-make-this-up territory.  My favorite this week: apparently
Republican supremo Ken Mehlman did sleazemeister Jack Abramoff a favor by 
<a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-mehlman15oct15,0,1634103.story?coll=la-home-headlines">getting
a government lawyer fired</a> for labor-policy reform efforts that were
bothering Abramoff’s clients.  Now, while this is an outstandingly clear
instance of corruption and evil in action at the highest levels, it’s really
nothing new; humanity is prone to corruption, large organizations 
(both public and private sector) are where it’s most profitable, and there will
always be a certain amount going on.  What pushed my weirdness-meter into
overload on this one is that while the <i>quid pro quo</i> was mostly at a
strategic level around large-scale campaign funding, in this particular case
Abramoff also scored Mehlman a couple of U2 concert tickets.  There’s just
something about U2 tickets being used to bribe officials to resist 
labor-law reform that resonates in all the wrong places.
And, for those who like to watch the show, I’m happy to report that

Any lover of engineering for its own sake would I think find the box breathtaking;
the cooling and power-supply designs are elegant and beautiful, and then the
whole thing being wrapped up in an anonymous steel rectangle is into
postmodern territory.  Suffice it to say
that some of the applications for this are things you Just Can’t Talk About,
and you can bet those aren’t going to have the snappy

it is just totally drop-dead fucking cool.

<title>Ubuntu Baby</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>What happened was, we had
<a href="http://www.hicup.com/bio/bio-index.htm">Kerith</a> over to take some
real family portraits (they came out great) and when I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/02/Scanner">scanned</a> her negatives,
there were gigabytes of pixels that I didn’t really want to copy
around the network, so I thought I’d drop ’em on a DVD.
This fragment combines Open Source serendipity, Microsoft-bashing, and
adorable baby photography.</p>
<p>Below, a four-month-old hand grasps a fifty-year-old finger. </p>
<img src="2-09.jpg" alt="Four-month-old hand grasps fifty-year-old finger" />
<div class="caption"><p>Photo by Kerith Paterson, via technology from Nikon,
Microsoft Windows, Ubuntu 
GNU/Linux, PhotoShop Elements, and
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Colophon">local bits &amp; pieces</a>.</p></div>
<p>I booted the Ultra 20 into Windows to do the scanning because that’s what
the Nikon software runs on.  When I was done, there were 3.3G of jpegs that I
wanted to look at and play around with on my Mac, and then keep
forever.</p>
<p>Given that networks are what they are, a DVD seemed the best answer to both,
and the Ultra has a DVD writer, so I slipped a blank in.  
Windows saw it all right, reported it accurately as a DVD-R blank, but when I
tried to drop files on it, I got the familiar old Abort/Retry/Cancel dialog
tarted up in cartoony XP colors.
Neither “burn DVD” nor “DVD-R”, typed into the Windows help popup,  helped in
the slightest, and and I sighed and consoled myself with the thought that the
wired part of the home network now runs at a gigabit.
Then I thought “hold on a second... Ubuntu“.</p>
<p>Ubuntu’s what normally runs on that Ultra except when it’s being used for
playing games or scanning.  So I did a quick reboot, 
and clicked on the thingie for the Windows filesystem to get at the
scans, and clicked at the thingie for the writeable-DVD, and dragged the
directory to the DVD and clicked “Write to Disc”, and it All Just Worked.</p>
<img src="DVD-writer-screenshot.png" alt="Ubuntu writing a DVD" />
<p>Nothing’s perfect; while burning, the time-remaining readout fluctuated wildly
between 5 and 40 minutes, no obvious pattern leaping to the eye.
And I should’ve edited the scans on the Gimp on Ubuntu, PhotoShop Elements on
the Mac 
screams for mercy and crashes regularly when you throw 35M slide scans at
it.</p>
<p>I keep asking: is Microsoft worried about Ubuntu?  They should be.</p>

<title>RubyConf</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I spent Friday through Sunday at
<a href="http://www.rubyconf.org/">RubyConf</a> in Denver; a small, friendly,
educational gathering.  The Ruby community is nice, and I’ve already praised
the technology enough; but the future is a bit opaque.</p>
<p>There are people here older than me—a handful.  
It’s a fairly standard-feeling OSS crowd.
Ruby has a serious demographic problem, pervasive in high-tech 
but worse here: there aren’t any women (maybe five among the 300 or so
attendees).</p>
<img src="IMG_5034.jpg" alt="An Embassy Suites, reflected here, hosted RubyConf" />
<div class="caption"><p>The conference hotel’s appearance is
much-improved by a little indirection.</p></div>
<p>The tech culture is Mac-heavy and text-heavy; a lot of talks started
with one or two creamy-smooth glamorous Keynote slides then switched into
command-line windows where the presenter interacted (live or recorded)
with the system.
Even the regular prize draws (for books) were accomplished by a 3-line
on-screen Ruby script that selected a random record out of a YAML file of the
attendees.</p>
<p>I can’t say enough good things about Chad Fowler, Rich Kilmer, and David
Black, the
<a href="http://rubycentral.org/">Ruby Central</a> guys who made it all go.</p>
<h2 id='p-15'>The Big Story</h2>
<p>Let’s start with a picture.</p>
<img src="IMG_5038.jpg" alt="Ruby Implementors" />
<p>Above, you see the Ruby Implementors’ summit.  Pardon the awfulness of the
shot; whatever skill it takes to get decent-looking interior shots in dark
rooms with a flash, I don’t have it.</p>
<p>“Implementors’ Summit?” you ask.  No, these aren’t just the people working on
Ruby the program; these are the people working on alternate/future versions of it,
including JRuby, RubyCLR, Rubinius, YARV, Cardinal (Ruby on Parrot).
If Ruby is a good language (it is) and people like using it (they do), 
why is all this going on?
One reason is that Ruby, compared to the competition like Python and Perl, is
kind of slow.  Obviously, there are lots of applications, like the kind Rails
builds, where the bottlenecks are the Web and the database and so on, and Ruby
doesn’t get in the way, but there are other applications where the performance
really is a problem.
While there’s another version of Ruby coming along to address this, there’s
still a lot of interim concern.
It looks like one substantial win came out of the meeting: an
agreement to work to aggregate and share test suites across all the
implementations.</p>
<p>There are a couple of other perceived problems with the current version of
Ruby; its lukewarm support for Unicode and the general weakness of its
built-in XML parser (for which, fortunately, there are alternatives).  So
there is hunger for fresh new versions of Ruby.</p> 
<h2 id='p-16'>The Mainstream</h2>
<p>There is a fresh new version of Ruby coming, to be called Ruby 2.0.
It’s being designed mostly by Matsumoto Yukihiro, the inventor of Ruby,
universally called
<a href="http://www.rubyist.net/~matz/">Matz</a>.  It will feature YARV, a new
virtual machine, 
being built by
<a href="http://www.atdot.net/~ko1/diary/">Sasada Koichi</a> (his online
handle is “Ko1” which is funny if you know a little Japanese).</p>
<img src="IMG_5046.jpg" alt="Ko1 and Matz" />
<div class="caption"><p>Koichi and Matz.</p></div>
<p>The problem is that Ruby 2 is not expected much before Christmas
2007.</p>
<h2 id='p-17'>Matz</h2>
<p>He is cheerful, thoughtful, and charming; he provides
fairly eloquent leadership of the Ruby community even though he has to shout
across the notoriously-difficult Japanese-English language chasm.</p>
<img src="Matz-2.jpg" alt="MATSUMOTO Yukihiro, a.k.a. Matz" />
<p>His keynote used the familiar bikeshed-at-the-powerplant meme in a
fresh new way (“Let’s turn all the Ruby 2 design problems into bikeshed
problems”).
He acknowledged the pressure for a new and better Ruby, but clearly it’s not 
bothering him very much; Ruby will be done in late
2007 and that’s when it’ll be done and that’s that.</p>
<p>His centeredness and calm has a Buddhist feel (actually, he’s Mormon).  
I’m not 100% sure he really understands the intensity of the
language fermentation he helped launch, now propelled by PHP and Rails and
TDD and loss of patience with frameworks that feel too big and heavy and
languages that feel too verbose and persnickety.
On the other hand, perhaps Matz just doesn’t see it as his problem; he’s concerned
with shipping a beautiful and useful tool, not with what the Western business
world sees as opportunity costs.</p>
<p>As of now, Rails continues to grow its fan base, Ruby books
sell like hotcakes, and a surprising number of developers here and there
around the world are just quietly using to Get Shit Done.
Almost anywhere you are, there’s a Ruby Users Group or a
Ruby Brigade meeting monthly.</p>
<p>Right now, I think it would be good for Sun and good for the Java community
and good for the industry if a whole lot more developers started
looking seriously at Ruby , either standalone or on the JVM.
I’m making that case a lot, and it would be an easier case to make if I didn’t
have to acknowledge Ruby’s performance and Unicode issues.  But those of us
making that case are having an impact
anyhow. </p>
<p>Maybe Matz is right.</p>
<p>And anyhow, with all these alternate-implemenation projects under way, I’d say
Ruby’s bets are pretty well hedged.</p>
<h2 id='p-18'>The Rest of the Conference</h2>
<p>I’d write it up but there’s no need; Curt Hibbs has
<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/ruby/blog/2006/10/blogging_about_rubyconf_2006.html">aggregated
the blogs</a> and
<a href="http://blog.nicksieger.com/">Nick Sieger</a> is capturing the whole
thing blow by blow.
My favorite talks were 
<a href="http://chopine.be/lrz/diary/">Laurent Sansonetti</a> from Apple on
using Ruby to automate OS X (No more AppleScript!  Yay!),
<a href="http://blog.talbott.ws/">Nathaniel Talbott</a> on

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing">Fuzzing</a>, if only because of his
minimalist gonzo slides, including a full-motion full-colour ASCII-art

<title>Oh My Goodness Gracious</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>In a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/17/In-A-Box">recent piece</a> on the new
<a href="http://www.sun.com/emrkt/blackbox/index.jsp">Project Blackbox</a>, I
used some coarse language, in an idiomatic way, not giving it much thought.  
The consequences were surprising.</p>
<p>Nick Carr
<a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2006/10/trailerpark_com.php">wondered</a>
about this, then an obviously-bored Martin Veitch
<a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=35246">had a little
fun</a> with the episode; his little gem being picked up as far afield as the
Malaysia Sun’s <cite>Technology News</cite> page.
Out of public view, the Sun internal bloggers alias exploded,
opinions ranging from those saluting me as an exemplar of
New Age Marketing and Proactive Transparency to others who felt my mouth ought
to be washed out; one person related that he’d heard from a Sun shareholder
who was going to sell as a consequence.</p>
<p>Dave Douglas, our VP of Advanced Technology, who’s one of the prime movers
on BlackBox, was surprised enough at all this that he wrote a thoughtful piece
entitled
<a href="http://www.nearwalden.com/blog/?p=510">Tim’s Bomb</a>.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>My Take</h2>
<p>Well, I could be flippant and quote Barnum about how I don’t care what they
say as long as they spell my name right.  And in point of fact, my little
BlackBox piece got way more traffic than it probably deserved.
But I really don’t think of it that way.</p>
<p>The pro and con of this are not that complex or subtle.  On the one side,
there are people who are genuinely and unaffectedly offended by 
coarse language; for them, my doing this devalues my message and even perhaps by
association, impairs their image of my employer.
On the other, I think that there is substantial value in the
transparency and honesty that characterizes the blogging medium in general and 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> in particular.  I am keenly aware that I am not
a great writer, and that the range of subjects on which I’m sufficiently
expert that my opinions ought to be taken seriously is pretty narrow.  
Given that, if I don’t offer 100% complete unvarnished honesty and
transparency, what am I offering?  And when I express myself naturally, my
language includes a certain amount of coarseness; nowhere the
Tarantino-screenplay level, but somewhere around the engineering norm.
So I’m reluctant to do anything that makes <span class='o'>ongoing</span>
read less like the way I really sound.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Surprise</h2>
<p>The real take-away is deeper.
Let me start here: I was surprised at this little flurry, because coarse
language has
<a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=fuck+OR+fucking+OR+fuckbrained+site%3Atbray.org">occurred
regularly</a> here at <span class='o'>ongoing</span>.
But not that much, because I’m used to surprise at the reactions to what
I write.</p>
<p>I long ago learned that carefully crafting a piece to get some particular
person’s attention, or to get it on Slashdot, was futile.
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/03/20/Women">Lovingly-crafted essays</a> on
subjects that I think are important sink without a trace, while
three-paragraph squibs touch off Minor Internet Memes and get hundreds of thousands
of reads.
Pieces that I think are lightweight and humorous offend people, and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/01/Bad-Craziness">edgy war diatribes</a>
bring me warm waves of supportive email.</p>
<p>As to the effect of what I write on the people who read it:
I don’t know.  I really, totally, absolutely, have no idea.  So what I do is
write the words that ask me to write them.  Then I read them again and decide
whether they say something that needs to be said, and if so I push the
“publish” button.</p>
<p>So, to anyone who was offended by my language: I’m sincerely sorry.  But that’s
really what I’m like.</p>

<title>Unicode and Ruby</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I gave a presentation called
<cite>I18n, M17n, Unicode, And All That</cite> at the recent
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/20/RubyConf">2006 RubyConf</a> in Denver.
This piece doesn’t duplicate this presentation; it outlines the problem, some
conference conversation, and includes a couple of images that you might want
to steal and use in a future Unicode presentation.
For those who don’t know, “i18n” is short for “internationalization”
(i-18 letters-n),  “m17n” for “multilingualization”, and you can call me
“T<b>1</b>m”.</p> 
<h2 id='p-1'>Background</h2>
<p>The object of my presentation was to argue, to the Ruby community and its
leadership, that I18n in general and Unicode in particular are really
important technologies which deserve to be taken quite a bit more seriously
than they currently are.</p>
<p>My 45 minutes included 20 or so introducing Unicode concepts and issues; I
was a little worried that this might be old hat, but when I asked for a show
of hands from people who thought they understood Unicode, damn few went up.
So I guess this was OK.  From that part of the presentation, here are a couple
of pretty graphics illustrating the structure and layout of the Unicode
character set.</p>
<img src="Unicode-Code-Points.png" alt="Unicode Code Points" />
<div class="caption"><p>Layout of the Unicode code-point space.</p></div>
<img src="Basic-Multilingual-Pane.png" alt="The Basic Multilingual Pane" />
<div class="caption"><p>Unicode’s Basic Multilingual Pane.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-6'>The Problem</h2>
<p>Right now, Ruby sees a String as a byte sequence, and doesn’t
provide much in the way of character-oriented, as opposed to byte-oriented,
functions.
Also, it has very little built-in knowledge of Unicode semantics, aside from a
few UTF-8 packing and unpacking capabilities, and some rudimentary regular
expression support.
Up till now, this hasn’t been seen as an urgent problem.</p>
<p>A solution has been promised in Ruby 2 (due next year, maybe); Matz calls
it M17n and has made some general remarks in speeches but hasn’t published
much in the way of code or documentation.</p>
<p>When I was preparing this talk, I sent email off to the Unicode people
saying “Hey, I’m going to be plugging your baby to an eager audience of a few
hundred eager programmers, want to send me some advertising?”  They sent me
some leaflets, but also a pre-release bound copy of the Unicode 5.0
manuscript.
All the previous versions of Unicode have been impressive and
beautiful books, and it looks like 5.0 will carry on the tradition.</p>
<p>Before my presentation, I was at the front of the room getting set and
talking to Matz, who was a little worried, I think, that I’d come in raining
fire and brimstone on all those who are not members of the Church of Unicode.
I got the 5.0 book out and told the organizers they could raffle it off (then
an idea struck) “...unless Matz wants it” and he did, so he has it now.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>Some Progress</h2>
<p>I had a talk over lunch with Matz and he made a couple of pretty good
points.
First, for operating on the Web, you just gotta do Unicode because it’s an inherently
multilingual place and Unicode is the only plausible way to deal with texts
that combine characters from lots of different languages.
But for people who are using Ruby to process their own data on their own
computers, compulsory Unicode round-tripping could be a real problem, because
it can cause breakage.
For example, take
currency-symbols.  In Japan, there is ambiguity in the JIS encodings
as to where the ¥ (Yen) symbol goes; anyone who’s used a Japanese keyboard and
seen a “¥” pop up when you hit the “\” key knows about this.</p>
<p>There’s another problem right here in our own round-eye gringo back yard;
namely the blurring of the border between two immensely popular encodings,
ISO-8859-1 and Microsoft Windows 1252.  Sam Ruby’s
<a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/stories/2004/04/14/i18n.html">Survival
Guide to I18n</a> (from 2004) covers these issues; also see a couple of slides
starting
<a href="http://intertwingly.net/slides/2005/etcon/39.html">here</a>,
<a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2004/09/23/Copy-and-Paste">Copy and
Paste</a>, and Mozilla
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=121174#c23">bug 121174
comment #23</a>.</p>
<p>So the problem with Ruby is, how do we make it easy and effortless for the
zillions of people who really need Unicode to Just Work, while at the same
time allowing others to avoid the potential round-trip breakage.</p>
<p>I don’t know the answer, but lots of people are looking at the problem,
along with Matz.  Julian Tarkhanov and Manfred Stienstra have been working on
ActiveSupport::MultiByte (get it from Edge Rails), Nikolai Weibull on the
<a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/char-encodings/">character-encodings
project</a>, and the JRuby guys are trying to build Ruby on a platform that’s
natively Unicode.</p>

<title>Telepresence</title>

<body>
<p>Check out
<a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/10/22/hd-telepresence-arrives/">Scoble
on Cisco’s HD telepresence</a>.  I think he’s underestimating the impact.  I’m
on the road every month, sometimes two or three times, and I hate the airlines
and the whole travel
system with the heat of a thousand suns.   Plus, I probably cost Sun the best
part of $100K a year in travel expenses.  Suppose you have a population of
employees like me; cutting travel costs in half for six of us would cover the
$300K price point.  Plus, think of the extra efficiency we’d get from not
spending all those endless hours in lines at airports.  Of the travel I do,
some part is actually need-to-be-there stuff; but if the HD telepresence
prices can be brought down a little and the virtual meetings cranked up a
little, this stuff is not that far from having slam-dunk ROI.</p>

<title>IBM vs. Amazon</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The Internet has been amazingly quiet about
<a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/20481.wss">IBM’s
litigation against Amazon</a>.  It feels to me like maybe the biggest Internet
story of, well, maybe, ever.
I haven’t gone and read the IBM patents yet, because reading patents always
depresses me.  If the titles mean anything (not always a sure bet), this might mean that IBM has finally managed to figure out how to
set up that Internet Tollbooth that we’ve always been afraid of.  If you’re
interested in “Presenting Applications in an Interactive Service”, “Storing
Data in an Interactive Network”, “Presenting Advertising in an Interactive
Service”, “Adjusting Hypertext Links with Weighted User Goals and Activities”,
or “Ordering Items Using an Electronic Catalogue”, apparently IBM thinks you
need to pay them for the right to do any of those things. 
If the courts agree with them, it’s time for me to find a new line of work.

<p>Check out
<a href="http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/166">Reinventing HTML</a>
by Tim Berners-Lee.  There’s going to be a new HTML Working Group, with a new
chair, new charter, new staff contact, new everything.  There’s no point me
reproducing Tim’s narrative about the charter, but it’s interesting; go read it.
I have had a very poor
relationship with the existing HTML WG, so I’m hardly unbiased;
but given the that the W3C’s impact on HTML over the last few years has been
essentially zero, I think that this has to be A Good Thing.

<title>Samsung, Ringtones, Fair Use</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>My cellphone expired, so I was poking around here and there on the net looking
for something unlocked in a GSM flavor; but one of my key criteria
is big buttons that I can see without my reading-glasses, and the Web just
doesn’t help you there. 
I ended up at a local grey-market emporium where a friendly 
Russian sold me a 
<a href="http://www.samsung.com/me/products/mobilephones/gsm/sgh_d600.asp">Samsung
SGH-D600</a>; it definitely meets the no-reading-glasses criterion and seems
like a pretty nice phone.  
This cute little slidey black goober lets you use any old MP3 as a ringtone.  Given
that most of us have tons o’ music on our computers, and it’s pretty easy to
slice out a sub-ten-second clip and Bluetooth it over to the phone, I guess
the ring-tones business is dead.  It seems obvious to me that using music I’ve
already paid for in this way is Fair Use, but I bet there’s a lawyer somewhere
who’d disagree for a fee.   So I sat up late one evening cackling fiendishly
over the audio software, and my ringtones are:
Mancini’s <cite>Peter Gunn
theme</cite> (the classic
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Anthony">Ray Anthony</a> version of
course), the opening sequences of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Spear">Burning Spear’s</a>
<cite>Slavery Days</cite> 
and Deep Purple’s <cite>Highway Star</cite> (off
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made_in_Japan_%28album%29">Made in

Horses</cite> from Phil Glass’ wonderful
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishima:_A_Life_in_Four_Chapters">Mishima

<title>Autumn Leaves</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>At RubyConf, a person I’d never met before said “You should be running more
pictures” and he was right, for some reason the camera hasn’t leapt out of my
pocket as readily in recent times.  But today I was walking down to the store
and there was this tree with the sun behind it and the leaves just
reached in and pulled the camera out.</p>
<p>The usual process is, you shoot a few dozen interesting shots and cut them
down to the one that’s essential.  But hey, they’re just bits, right, why not
keep more than one?</p>

<title>Lost Souls, Documented</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>On Saturday night I marched in the 
<a href="http://www.publicdreams.org/event_details.html?day=28&amp;month=10&amp;year=2006">Parade
of the Lost Souls</a>.  It was a thrilling evening; I came home exhausted,
sore, and happy.  It was also extremely well-documented.
<i>[Update:
<a
href="http://vancouver.metblogs.com/archives/2006/10/parade_of_the_lost_souls_2006.phtml">Another
write-up</a>.]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Event</h2>
<p>I marched as part of an African-drum band led by 
<a href="http://www.drumming.ca">Russell Shumsky</a>; Eleven
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djembe">Djembés</a> and five
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunun">Dununs</a>.  We played for 2¾
hours, with maybe half an hour of breaks.
I don’t know how good we really were, but people clapped when we stopped and
danced like crazy whenever there was room, which is a fine thing to see.</p>
<p>We were one of three marching bands—there was also a stage with other bands
performing—and then there were many non-musical performers:
stilt-walkers, fire-dancers, fire-eaters, fire-throwers, fire-worshippers, and
then all the usual things you find at street
events.</p>
<img src="IMG_0493.jpg" alt="Tim playing Djembe at the Parade of the Lost Souls" />
<div class="caption"><p>Your correspondent. <i>[Photo by 
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>.]</i></p></div>
<p>Also, some tens of thousands of Vancouverites were there for the fun;
quite a few of them in costume.
There’s no such thing as a homogeneous crowd in this town; they ranged from
Commercial-Drive hipsters to exuberant sexual minorities to just plain folks
from the burbs.  There were electric guitarists in the
trees and giant spiders in the alleys 
and lanterns in the dark and drums,
drums everywhere, not just us.</p>
<p>Was it perfect?  
No, some idiot threw a powerful firecracker right at my
feet from behind as we were playing; it scared me half to death and
deafened me temporarily in one ear.  Banging on a drum puts you in touch with
your inner cave-man; I turned and howled, ready to inflict
massive violence; if whoever it was hadn’t faded into the crowd I’d have done
my best to tear his head off on the spot.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Documentation</h2>
<p>Right away, as soon as the parade started, I noticed a whole lot of
cameras, video and still.  Some were elaborate, obviously
in the hands of professionals, zooming in for close-ups and back for pans as
we pounded along the route.</p>
<p>Then there were the amateurs; we were taking a break and two giggly teenage
girls came up and asked me to pose with one for the other.
“Wow, that came out <em>great</em>!” she said; but I’ll never see it.</p>
<p>This morning, I glanced at Flickr.  There
were a few when I got up, and now, 24 hours later as I write, 
<a href="http://flickr.com/search/?q=++parade+lost+souls+&amp;d=taken-20061027-&amp;s=int">there
are 478</a>.
One
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/trentm/282946467/">photo of our band</a>
made into the first couple of screens-full of “most interesting” pictures, and I
even show up
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/lens_flair/281988445/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Hey, there’s a
<a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=2d_fUxPTR-I#">pretty decent video</a> from the 2004
parade (there was none in 2005) on YouTube; I bet there’ll be some from
this year up there soon.</p>
<p>Now, what with one thing and another, Vancouver is a little more
Flickr-centric than most places, but still, I think, this is the future.
Nothing can be done in secret at a public event now, it’ll be captured for
sure, probably many times.  And then remembered for ever for everyone.</p>

<title>Data that Holds Still</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>These last few days, I’ve been sketching in some code for an idea I have
that you’ll hear about if it works.  Unlike most of my recent projects, it’s
got no network links or message-passing or socket-munging, it just processes
some data and produces some other data.  The main
difference is, it’s incredibly easy to unit-test.  There are lots of
network-programming tasks where I just don’t even know how to unit-test, and
where you can do it, it takes a lot of extra work and orchestration, and so
the temptation to slack off can be irresistible, for me at least.
Someone who really wanted to advance the state of the art in software could
work on reducing the friction for developers who believe in TDD but have to write
distributed code.</p>

<title>Zend/PHP Conference</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I spoke Tuesday morning at the 
<a href="http://www.zendcon.com/">Zend/PHP Conference &amp; Expo</a> in San
Jose.  I was kind of overloaded and only had four hours among the PHP gang,
but it was instructive, particularly in the context of my recent
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/20/RubyConf">RubyConf</a>
experience.</p>
<p>The conference was exhaustively blogged by
<a href="http://dshadow.livejournal.com/tag/zendconference2006">John
Bafford</a>; judging by his report of the panel I was on, I’d say this is good
accurate stuff.  
I’d report that panel, but I don’t need to because
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/10/31/HNzendpanel_1.html">Paul
Krill did</a>, very nicely.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>PHP Culture in Bullets</h2>
<p>Let’s assume that this conference is representative of PHP culture.
I don’t use bullet points in my conference talks any more, but that doesn’t
mean there’s anything intrinsically wrong with them:</p>
<img src="IMG_5065.jpg" alt="Mark de Visser, Andi Gutmans, Zeev Suraski" />
<div class="caption"><p>Mark de Visser, Andi Gutmans, and Zeev Suraski of
Zend.  The name “Zend” is derived from Andi and Zeev.</p></div>
<ul>
<li><p>Everyone in the leadership has an accent falling somewhere in the
MittelEuropa-to-Israel spectrum.</p></li>
<li><p>They worry about performance a lot, all the time.  Every speaker
without  exception stressed the performance angle of whatever they’re
doing.</p></li>
<li><p>There are more women, maybe around 20%.</p></li>
<li><p>There was a guy in the plenary carrying a skateboard over his
shoulder.</p></li>
<li><p>They had 550 attendees.</p></li>
<li><p>There was good old fashioned conference schwag in the conference bag; a
cool flashing yo-yo and a deck of playing cards.  My seven-year-old has
both.</p></li>
<li><p>Andi Gutmans said “the right way to think about PHP is
as Visual Basic for the Web.”</p></li>
<li><p>They had no trouble putting together a plenary panel with
representatives from Microsoft, Oracle, Sun, MySQL, and IBM.</p></li>
<li><p>Unicode support is shaky, but they take the problem seriously and plan
to fix it in PHP6, in what looks to me like a smart way.</p></li>
</ul>
<img src="IMG_5072.jpg" alt="Bill Hilf" />
<div class="caption"><p>Bill Hilf of Microsoft.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-2'>PHP and Microsoft</h2>
<p>Right now, a lot of PHP developers develop but don’t deploy on Windows;
apparently there are real performance and reliability issues.  Microsoft has
noticed this; they sent the excellent Bill Hilf to the conference, and are spending
money and resources to fix the problem.
For example, IIS is getting a PHP-friendly FastCGI add-on.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>PHP and Ruby</h2>
<p>In the plenary Q&amp;A, one question was “ActiveRecord for PHP?” and
another was “What do you think of Rails?”  The answer to the first was more
or less, “We’re not convinced that’s an appropriate direction” and to the
second was frankly snotty: “Ruby is appropriate for computer-science-loving
people who have a puristic <i>[sic]</i> attitude”.</p>
<img src="IMG_5069.jpg" alt="Andi Gutmans and Andrei Zmievski" />
<div class="caption"><p>Andi Gutmans with Andrei Zmievski, who’s leading the
charge on adding Unicode to PHP6.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-4'>On Stacks</h2>
<p>My impression is that most LAMP apps are deployed on a catch-as-catch-can
stack, the integrator putting together an OS/database infrastructure depending
on local standards and conditions.  I get the feeling that quite a few vendors
would like to be in the business of selling integrated stacks and are trying
to build a case that that’s what people should be deploying.
It’ll be interesting to see how this plays out.</p>
<p>I’m not sure; one of LAMP’s big strengths is that it offers excellent
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/webmink/entry/freedom_to_leave">freedom to
leave</a>.  To the extent that you commit to someone’s integrated stack, you
may compromise that.  On the other hand, removing integration friction has to
be a good thing.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>My Opinion</h2>
<p>PHP has had a lot of successes and has a vigorous, aggressive culture. 
I don’t think Sun is doing enough to support it.</p>

<title>Startup Camp</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I spent Thursday and Friday at
<a href="http://www.startupcamp.org/">Startup Camp</a>, at the
<a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/">Computer History Museum</a>.
This event was sort of originally my idea, but smart Sun people retained the
good parts—make it an unConference, involve David Berlind—and discarded
my silly theming notions; the “Startup Camp” pitch obviously touched a nerve,
because the place was packed.</p>
<p>My notes on the event are pretty disorganized, and I can’t think of an
obvious way to straighten them out, sorry.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Web Video</h2>
<p>There were a couple of sessions on multimedia.  YouTube has proved that
anyone can post video to the Net in a way that anyone else can see, as long as
you don’t mind it looking like shit.  For people like me, who
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/Video/">care about high-quality video</a>,
the news is lousy.  As soon as you start asking Someone Who Knows about What
You Should Do, they descend into arcana about codecs and de-interlacing and
MPEG-this and AVC-that.
Someone will eventually get it right.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Good Sound-Bites</h2>
<p>“Your garage is your personal input/output port.”
“Second Life?  I don’t have a first life”
- <a href="http://www.sifry.com/alerts/">Dave Sifry</a>.
“All the major players in Identity think they have the best protocol.  They
can’t all be right” -
<a href="http://netmesh.info/jernst">Johannes Ernst</a>.
</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Second Life</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.syndic8.com/weblog/">Jeff Barr</a> was much in evidence,
wowing everyone with how he uses Second Life to support his evangelism work.
I still fail to really “get Second Life”, but this sounds like it might be an
actual practical useful application.  I was sufficiently motivated to sign up
for a year’s paid membership and walk
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/03/27/Full-of-Second-Life">Bengal
Solzhenitsyn</a> into a store and buy him a new cowboy hat.  (But I really want
a sharp Humphrey-Bogart fedora.)</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Speed Geeking</h2>
<p>It works great!  If you can’t give your pitch in five minutes, you’re
hosed anyhow, and if you’ve heard lots of pitches, you know that most of them
are bad, and the guarantee that you’ll be out in five minutes is a big plus.
The good ones, you can go back and talk to later.</p>
<img src="IMG_5080.jpg" alt="Gretchen DeKnikker from EchoSign, contest winner" />
<div class="caption"><p>One of the contest winners discovers that an Ultra 40 <em>will</em>

<a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>, and an as-yet-unnamed Fashion
Predictor startup (they got my vote, and you’ll be reading more about them
here if they get off the ground).</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Why?</h2>
<p>Why did Sun put this on?  To listen.  This is the pointy end of the pointy
end of the economy’s hottest growth area.  Sun is pretty good at figuring out
what big Establishment companies need, but it’s actually hard to guess
what next year’s startups are going to care about.  So get a bunch of ’em in
the room and listen and they’ll tell you.  Cheap at the price.</p>

<p>I’m here at Startup Camp, which is a blast and I’ll write about it.  
But I just heard that we’ve gone public with the Sun
<a href="http://sun.com/startupessentials/">Startup Essentials</a> program.
That page is a little marketing-heavy but I can squeeze it into a sentence: If your
company is in the US, is less than four years old, has 150 employees or
less, <s>and you’re willing to run Solaris</s>, you can get deep,
<em>scary</em>-deep,
<a href="http://www.sun.com/emrkt/startupessentials/offerings.jsp">discounts</a> on our hardware.
Check it out.  Hmph, they don’t say what the discounts are, you have to join
up and log in to see them.  Also, it’s a bug that this only applies in the
U.S., I assume we’ll fix that.  But still, this seems like A Good Thing.

<p>When I do talks for Sun events and where the material needs to be
re-usable, I always use the
<a href="http://www.neooffice.org/">NeoOffice</a> version of OpenOffice.org, because
then I can give people ODF (or PPT, or PDF, or just about anything else you
can imagine).  When I’m doing an outward-facing presentation and either I
really <em>really</em> care about trying to move the needle with the audience,
or I have my back to the wall time-wise, I use
<a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/">Keynote</a>.
It’s been a few busy travel-packed weeks, and I had speeches to make at
<a href="http://jax.de/">JAX.de</a> and the
<a href="http://phpconference.com/">International PHP Conference</a>, both
audiences important, I thought, so they got Keynote presentations.  Anyhow,
my real purpose here is just to say that the Keynote authoring interface is
just totally excellent, amazingly good; and I speak as a pretty expert user of
both PowerPoint and OpenOffice.org.
For my money, maybe the best app Apple ships.</p>

<title>Metered Approval</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>What happened was, as we were getting ready to leave the apartment in
Frankfurt a bunch of comments showed up, and when I clicked “Approve” the Net
had gone away for some reason and we had to leave.  At the airport, I noticed
they had lots of these hokey Internet-by-the-minute kiosks; I’d never used
one.  While writing <span class='o'>ongoing</span> fragments requires an
intricate web of technology and a solid <code>ssh</code> connection, the
comment system is pure browser-based simplicity.  The kiosk interface is
slick, it lets you enter a URL and doesn’t ask for money until you say ”Go“. 
So I slapped in a €0.20 coin and
started struggling with the German keyboard, which makes the “Y” and “/” hard
to find.  Eventually I reached the approval page and got logged in
and saw the comments again.  I was about ready to hit the button when this
thing popped up on the screen, “Your time is running out in 30 ... 29 ... 28
...”, quite nerve-wracking in fact.  I dove into my pocket and found
another double-Euro-dime with seconds to spare, giving me time for the approval
to complete and to use the “logout” button.  
What a weird feeling.
I wonder if these things are profitable?</p>

<title>An RX for Ruby Performance</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is an insanely long and gnarly essay about implementing, then optimizing,
the low-level bits of a pure-Ruby XML parser.  If you obsess about XML reading,
deterministic finite automata, or Ruby code optimization, you may find some part
of it interesting.  There may perhaps be six people in the world who 
care about all three; others are warned that an attempt to read this end to end
may lead to general paralysis and perhaps even
clinical brain-death. <i>[He’s not kidding. -Ed.]</i> 
By way of compensation, I’ve tried to be offensive
wherever the opportunity presented.
<i>[Update: Outstanding comment from Avi Bryant below, which he repeats and
expands
<a href="http://smallthought.com/avi/?p=17">here</a>.]</i>
</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Problem</h2>
<p>The state of XML parsing in Ruby is not that great.
The incumbent default is
<a href="http://www.germane-software.com/software/rexml/">REXML</a>.
Let me start out by saying that its XPath implementation is first-rate, and
you can do almost all day-to-day network message processing—for example,
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/11/Meet-the-Ape">implementing the APP</a>—by throwing XPaths at your message buffer.</p>
<p>Also, REXML comes with a DOM mode, a pull parser, and an event-stream parser, all
of which are Good Things.</p>
<p>Those aside, REXML has problems.  To start with, it’s non-conforming,
busted, incorrect, you pick the imprecation, because it happily eats
lots of mangled, non-well-formed byteglobs which claim to be XML but aren’t, in
direct contravention of 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#dt-fatal">this rule</a>.
<i>[Isn’t this a little anal/pedantic? -Ed.  And your point is?  -Tim]</i>
</p>
<p>Another irritant is that the API, and the documentation for the API,
take great care never to describe the parts of an XML document using the terms
defined in the XML specification.  Consider for example, in the event-stream
parser, the
<a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/rexml/rdoc/classes/REXML/StreamListener.html#M000129">DOCTYPE 
declaration handler</a>, which was apparently designed on Mars.</p>
<p>Finally, REXML is regarded by some as slow.</p>
<p>There are alternatives; you can get XML handlers based on libxml2 and
expat, the two most widely-used C-language XML processors.  At that recent
RubyConf I attended, REXML complaints were usually dismissed with a brusque
“So use libxml already”.</p>
<p>I have three problem with those approaches.  First, they mean you have to
download, compile, and install new software, which sucks.  
Second, all of this software is, uh,
“lightly maintained” (REXML too).  Third, I think that key Ruby
libraries should, insofar as possible, be written in Ruby.  There are
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/20/RubyConf#p-15">lots of
different efforts</a> to re-implement Ruby, any of which could end up being
dramatically faster and better than the current C implementation in some set
of circumstances, and to the extent that the libraries are in Ruby, they’ll
come along for free.  Also, C programming rots your brain.
<i>[Really?  -Ed.  Your spleen too. -Tim]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Lark</h2>
<p>Back in 1996, I wrote the world’s first reasonably-conformant XML 1.0
processor, named Lark, in Java.  It’s called “Lark”
because on our honeymoon, my wife Lauren ripped her knee up and we had to
spend a few days camped out with her leg raised and immobilized, so I used
that time to do the coding; thus Lark for “<b>La</b>uren’s <b>r</b>ight
<b>k</b>nee”.  
<i>[Hey, your tenth anniversary is coming up. -Ed.  But you digress.  -Tim]</i></p>
<p>As a side effect of writing Lark, I learned Java, using Microsoft’s “Visual
J++”, which in its early releases was a terrific product, before they ruined it.
Lark was quite successful and fairly widely deployed in production, but after
a while
there were parsers on the market from Microsoft, IBM, and James Clark, and I
just didn’t feel like maintaining it as a permanent sideline, so I let it
lapse in 1998 sometime. <i>[Is there an attention-span issue here?  -Ed.
What? -Tim]</i>
</p>
<p>I’m going to have to give a fairly detailed description of how Lark worked
if the rest of this is going to make any sense.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Parser Flavors</h2>
<p>There are a lot of standard parser architectures:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser">recursive-descent</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LR_parser">LR</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LALR">LALR</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_state_machine">state-machine</a>,
and so on.  Most XML parsers are some flavor of recursive descent, but Lark
was a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton">deterministic
finite automaton (DFA)</a>.</p>
<p>A character-driven DFA couldn’t be simpler.  You keep track of what state
you’re in, and read the next character.  Each state has a list of transitions
for particular characters, so you look up your character and and find
the transition—if there isn’t one that’s a syntax error.</p>
<p>Since you’d like your parser to actually do something, not just parse, it’s
common to associate “events” or “actions” with transitions.  It’s also common
to enhance a DFA slightly with a push-down stack, so you can jump to another
state and remember where to come back to at some future point.</p>
<p>The simplest way to implement a DFA is a simple two-dimensional array; each
state has a number, which indexes the rows of the array, and you use the
numeric character value to index into a per-state array of transitions.  So
the inner loop of your code would end up looking something like this:</p>
<pre><code>state = dfa[state][character]</code></pre>
<p>You can use a similar trick to look up the actions or events associated
with a transition.</p>
<p>Of course, in practice, the arrays could get very big (Unicode has
potentially a million or so characters), so  DFAs are often
implemented using lists or sparse-matrix tricks.</p>
<p>The great virtue of a DFA parsers is that <em>you only have to look at each
character once</em>.   Lark, in its day, was blindingly fast, and only James
Clark managed to produce a faster parser using all sorts of brilliantly sleazy I/O tricks;
I was pretty sure I could have leapfrogged his performance if I’d gone back
and stolen some of them.
<i>[Coulda been a contender, eh? -Ed.]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-9'>The Machine</h2>
<p>The way Lark worked was, I hand-wrote the automaton in a language I made up
in a hurry for the purpose.  
<i>[Not XML?  -Ed.  Why would I use XML? -Tim]</i>
Here’s a sample, describing the state
where you’re cruising along through the text and have seen a <code>&lt;</code>,
signaling the start of a start-tag, end-tag, empty-element-tag, or processing instruction.</p>
<pre><code>1. State SawLT BustedMarkup {after &lt;}
2. T ? Push(InPI,InDoc) !ColdStart
3. T ! MDO
4. T / ETAGO
5. T $NameStart StagGI !HotStart</code></pre>
<p>Line 1 gives the state name, “SawLT”, and then there’s another state,
“BustedMarkup”, to fall back into for error-reporting purposes if the next
character isn’t valid.  The curly braces enclose some text to help build an error
message when things go wrong.
The rest of the lines, starting with “T”, describe this state’s transitions.</p>
<p>Let’s do line 3 before line 2, because it’s simpler.  It says that if
you’re in “SawLT” and you see a <code>!</code>, you should do a transition to
the state named “MDO”; the name is taken from the XML spec production, in this case
standing for Markup Declaration Open.  In fact, this has to be the start of a
CDATA section.</p>
<p>Line 2 says that when you’re in “SawLT” and see a <code>?</code>,
this has to be the start of a processing instruction, so you push to the
“InPI” state, leaving the “InDoc” state on the stack; a subsequent
<code>Pop</code> when you see the end of the PI will take you back there.
Also, this transition will fire the action called <code>ColdStart</code>,
which means the parser needs to start saving the characters going by, starting
with the <em>next</em> character.</p>
<p>Line 4 is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<p>Line 5 has a couple more wrinkles.  First of all, the transition isn’t
on a character, it’s on <code>$NameStart</code>, which is short-hand for “any
character which can be used to start an XML name”.  Also it fires the
<code>HotStart</code> action, which turns on character saving with
<em>this</em> character. </p>
<p>By the way, you can have more than one action associated with a
transition.</p>
<h2 id='p-10'>Little Tables</h2>
<p>It turns out that the automaton had less than 256 states, so the state
number would fit in a byte.  Cool!  But the characters, being Unicode,
obviously wouldn’t.  So I was driven to trickery.  For most of the parser states,
notably when you’re reading text, any old Unicode character that’s not a magic
syntax character like <code>&lt;</code> or <code>&amp;</code> will do, so you
save the real character, but substitute something 
like <code>~</code> to drive the automaton;
it’ll have the same effect.  
For some states, the value of the character
matters, as in the example above.  In which case you have to 
check that the character you saw is an XML <code>NameStart</code>,
but if it is, you can slap in <code>a</code> or any other valid name-starter
and that’ll drive the automaton fine.
So all you need is a per-state table of which character-classes apply in which
states. It turns out that there aren’t any states in which more than one class
has a valid transition, and that in most states, none of them matter.
Thus the cost of all this jiggery-pokery is low.</p>
<p>The core of the Lark machine was a <i>transitions</i> table indexed by
byte-sized state number, each state being a byte array indexed by the next
input character or a class surrogate.
Similarly, there was an <i>actions</i> table indexed the same way.
Thus, the main loop of the parser ends up looking something like this:</p>
<pre><code>state = START_STATE
while true
  c = next_char
  break if c == nil
  next_state = machine[state][c]
  if next_state == 0
    handle_syntax_error
  end
  action = actions[state][c]
  if action
    call_action_routines(action)
  end
  state = next_state
end</code></pre>
<h2 id='p-11'>RX</h2>
<p>So I Ruby-fied some of Lark, for the moment calling it RX because I had to
think up a name for the development directory.
I really hadn’t (and still haven’t) worked out the goals; if it turned out
to be both more correct and faster than REXML then maybe it might be worth
seeing if it could be slipped in underneath, preserving REXML’s crunchy XPath
goodness.  But really, I mostly did it because I could.</p>
<p>The implementation was pretty well pure fun; particularly the part that
read the automaton and wrote the machine: <code>class MachineBuilder</code>.
I stored both the transitions
and actions tables in Ruby strings, which conveniently act like byte arrays
when you throw a <code>[number]</code> at them.
I had to generate some Ruby code; there are hand-written Ruby methods for each
of the actions that can fire, so I wrote a little <code>do_action</code>
routine which used a giant <code>case</code> on the action number to
select which routines to call.  Also that file contained the grungy logic for
looking in the XML character-class tables to determine whether something was a
<code>NameStart</code> or <code>NameChar</code> or <code>Digit</code> or
whatever.</p>
<p>The actual parsing code was really simple, way under 500 lines.
The input-handling code was also short but harder; it had to do the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-guessing">character encoding
auto-detection</a> and turn UTF-8, UTF-16 (I also did ISO-8859-1 and ASCII)
into streams of Unicode integer code points.</p>
<p>On my first pass through, I entirely resisted the premature-optimization
temptation, implementing everything in the most simple-minded way possible;
this was easier than you might think because my Ruby experience is brief
enough that I have few misleading intuitions about what’s fast and what’s
slow.</p>
<p>As I write this, the MachineBuilder reports “110 states, 28416 bytes, 69
actions”, and the generated Ruby file has 683 lines of really boring code.</p>
<p>The machine is a whole lot smaller than the version in Lark, and to explain
why, a digression is necessary.
<i>[This is already too long.  -Ed. A man’s gotta do what he’s gotta do. -Tim]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-12'>Network-Safe XML</h2>
<p>As I reviewed the Lark code, my mind boggled at the high proportion that
existed to handle what XML calls “General Entities”, that is, the entities you
can define yourself in your DTD.  XHTML, for example, has hundreds of these,
like <code>&amp;yen;</code> and <code>&amp;copy;</code> and so on and so
on.</p>
<p>The problem is that in the general case, XML lets you define the entities
right there in the document, and furthermore lets them include other entities,
so that the parser has to have a fairly sophisticated stack manager and input
stream manager.</p>
<p>As I looked at this and thought about the work I’ve recently been doing
with Atom, I got more and more nervous and unhappy.  I thought of the “billion
laughs” attack, and other things bad guys could do with DTDs.</p>
<p>So I threw out the internal subset.  This seems like a good solution to
me.  <i>[Are you raping XML? -Ed. Go away.  -Tim]</i>
The parser reports entity references, so if you know you’re handling,
for example, 
XHTML, you can provide the appropriate replacement values.  But I just
couldn’t get comfortable with arbitrary macro processing in-file.
RX still parses the DOCTYPE, if present and tells you what the public and
system identifiers are, but if it sees an internal subset it stops cold.</p>
<p>Yes, arguably I’m fucking with the basic nature of XML here, but I suspect
I’m right.  In practical terms, REXML doesn’t really handle XML general
entities either, so I’m no worse.  More discussion is probably called for.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>First Cut</h2>
<p>I have unit tests for the input manager and the QName wrangler
(thankfully, there are lots of XML test suites out there).  I was pondering
how to test the actual parser; an automaton is a great big glob of pretty
abstract code, and the high-level unit-testing approach wasn’t obvious.
Obviously I cared not only about XML conformance detection, but about the data
passed to the app using the parser.</p>
<p>So I implemented REXML’s
<code>StreamListener</code> event-stream interface, and figured that for my
first debugging pass, if I could get the same results as REXML on some
nontrivial XML files, that’d be a start.  So I wrote this little chunk of code
that counts the number of processing instructions, elements, paragraph
elements, <code>img</code> elements that have a <code>src=</code> attribute
with a value ending in <code>jpg</code>, and occurrences of the word “the” in
text content.</p>
<p>It wasn’t too long before I was getting the same results as REXML on quite
a few different chunks of XML, most notably 2½ meg of 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> articles. <i>[Is my blog eating my life?  And
that 2½M was before I started writing the tome you are now reading.]</i></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the first cut was approximately ten times slower than REXML.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>The Profiler</h2>
<p>So, I broke out the Ruby profiler. <i>[Cue crazed laughter in the
background.]</i>  Which is perfectly fine, except for it’s, well, slow.  As in
really slow.  As in one particular run which normally took 0.826 seconds of user time
burned 134.36 seconds with the profiler’s help.</p>
<p>The profiler revealed a whole bunch of things.  First, my naïve input
implementation predictably sucked rocks.  
<i>[“Sucked rocks”? -Ed.  Uh, kind of weak, isn’t it?  -Tim]</i>
It was using byte-at-a-time input
reads to drive character-at-a-time parser input.  So I hacked in a fairly
standard buffered I/O setup.  If I had a nickel for every time I’ve juiced up
a program by fixing the I/O buffering I’d have, well, a couple of bucks
anyhow.</p>
<p>The next obvious sinner was that <code>do_action</code> routine, which had
a 69-way <code>case</code> selecting among all the possible sets of actions that
a transition could fire.  
I was seeing major time vanishing there and, via it, in
<code>Fixnum#===</code>.
Gack.  I’m an old C/Java hacker, and I had this notion that most language’s
<code>case</code> constructs were there to provide <em>rapid</em> selection
among a bunch of alternatives.   Ruby’s, on the other hand, provides all sorts
of cool features not found elsewhere, but they don’t include rapid selection.</p>
<p>OK, so for each of the 69 action combinations, I generate a method, here’s
one of them:</p>
<pre><code>    def action_5(c)
      result = false
      result ||= a_Push(c, 60)
      result ||= a_ColdStart(c)
      result
    end</code></pre>
<p>Then I loaded up an array like so:</p>
<pre><code>    def load_actions
      @@action_dispatcher = [
        nil,
        method(:action_1),
        method(:action_2),
        ...</code></pre>
<p>Then <code>do_action</code> became:</p>
<pre><code>    def do_action(i, c)
      @@action_dispatcher[i].call(c)
    end</code></pre>
<p>All this made a remarkable difference.  
<i>[This sucks. -Ed.  I’m not sure -Tim]</i>
But I was still way behind
REXML.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Second Cut</h2>
<p>After spending more quality time waiting for the profiler, it became
obvious that my per-char main loop was killing me.  Here’s the actual code
that’s run, with the input character living in <code>c</code> and the
automaton driver (see above) in <code>b</code>:</p>
<pre><code>        @buf &lt;&lt; c if @saving

        index = (@state * 128) + b
        @to = nil
        action = do_action(@@actions[index], c) if @@actions[index] != 0

        # turn crank unless action already set the next state
        @to = @@machine[index] unless @to

        @state = @to
        ...</code></pre>
<p>It was burning the vast majority of my CPU.  Not having any brilliant ideas
        how to optimize it, it struck me that I ought to do it less.</p>
<p>At this point I had an inspiration (which could have been used with the
        original Java-flavored Lark, too).  An XML parser’s performance is
        especially interesting when the input is large.
	Large XML documents typically contain large runs of text content, and
        the state machine is going to spin its way stupidly through these,
        saying, for each character, “is this <code>&lt;</code> or
        <code>&amp;</code>? Nope?  Save it and move right along, nothing to
        see here.” </p>
<p>So I refactored away, changing the input subsystem to turn its input buffer
        into a list of buffers, some of them one character in length and
        containing either <code>&lt;</code> or <code>&amp;</code>, and others,
        any length at all, guaranteed not to contain either magic syntax
        character.</p>
<p>Then the main parser loop, each time around, would check whether it was in
        the well-known plain-text-reading-state, and if so, was it more than
        one character into the input buffer, and if so, ask the input system
        for the whole buffer, known not to contain any syntax.</p>
<p>This successfully cut down the number of times through the main loop.
Unfortunately, it also made everything slower.  Why?</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>Third Cut</h2>
<p>Let’s have fun waiting for the profiler again, shan’t we?
Gack!  <code>Array#index</code> and <code>Fixnum#==</code> are eating my
brain!  You see, I’d exploded the input string, be it UTF-8 or UTF-16 or
        whatever, into an array of Unicode character integers, and was using
        <code>index</code> to find the syntax characters.  Silly, silly me.
At this point I reflected on the downside of making classes like
        <code>Fixnum</code> and <code>Array</code> open, and took a couple of
        days off to think.</p>
<h2 id='p-17'>Fourth Cut</h2>
<p>Well, REXML is faster, I thought, and it’s regexp-based, so they must be
        fast, unlike <code>case</code> constructs and
<code>Array#index</code>.  So I buckled down and made my input subsystem
        much more complex; in the case where the input is something Ruby
        regular expressions can handle (as in, most single-byte encodings) I
        used regular expressions to chop up the input strings.</p>
<pre><code>        @bufs_waiting = buf.scan /&lt;|&amp;|[^&lt;&amp;]+/mu
        @bufs_waiting.map! { |b| b.unpack('U*') }</code></pre>
<p>This made a huge difference; I was now within spitting distance of REXML.
It turns out that <code>unpack</code> is real fast.  Pity about the people
        who use UTF-16; I had to write horrid per-byte expansion logic for
        that case, and I haven’t measured it, but I bet it’s gonna suck.</p>
<h2 id='p-18'>Fifth Cut</h2>
<p>Another run with the profiler <i>[Row, row, row, your boat, gently
        down the stream/merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream]</i>
        suggested that Ruby method dispatch is simply not up to processing any
        nontrivial text on a per-character basis, so I changed the interface
        to the input subsystem from <code>next_char</code> to
        <code>next_chars</code>.  Yep, that helped.</p>
<h2 id='p-19'>Conclusions</h2>
<p>For C and Java programmers like me, Ruby is a new territory and things may
        not be what they seem.  I’m OK with the <code>case</code> construct
        being what it is, and with using regexes to pick things apart.
	But I’m irritated about the lousy performance of integer arrays.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing: Inside the computer, arrays of numbers is all there
        are.  Over the years, I’ve developed an instinct: if you can find a
        way to represent a problem so that you store and manipulate the data
        using arrays of integers, you usually win, big-time.  This is one
        reason why finite automata can be made to run so fast.
	Apparently, in the world of Ruby, my instinct is wrong.
	The problem is really the open classes; because I might choose to
        override <code>Array#index</code> or <code>Fixnum#==</code>, the
        runtime isn’t allowed to notice that these are just integer arrays and
        emit low-level indirection-free code to treat them that way.
	So maybe Ruby needs a <code>FrozenArray</code> or
        <code>FrozenFixnum</code> class, to make bit-bangers like me happy.
	</p> 
<p>Except for, everyone says that Smalltalk VMs can do this kind of thing real
        fast.  Gilad
        Bracha, where are you?</p>
<h2 id='p-8'>As Of Now</h2>
<p>The code is 
<a href="/code/rx.tgz">here</a>.
And here’s a profiler run showing everything that used 0.5% or more of the CPU
        time.  RX is
        still only about half as fast as REXML.  I haven’t given up yet, and
        I’ve learned a few things.

<title>Comparing Frameworks</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>On Wednesday in Frankfurt at the
<a href="http://phpconference.com/">PHP International Conference</a> I gave a
fairly general talk on issues in Web frameworks.  I had fun making a
graph comparing Java, PHP, and Rails, and you might enjoy
it too.
<i>[Update: Theserverside.com has a grossly inaccurate flame-bait take on
this, and won’t let me sign in to comment; won’t take my password, and also
won’t take the one they email me when I say I forgot.  Grr.]
[Update, February 2007: There’s now a 
<a href="http://kaistizen.net/EE/index.php/comparing_frameworks/">Korean
translation</a> by CHOI Jae-Hoon; thanks!]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Context</h2>
<p>The problem at hand is Web Application Building.  Thus we are <em>not</em>
considering general issues of compute performance, because in Web apps, you
don’t do much computing.  You get some values from the browser, you use them
to pull some info out of a database, you report them to the user, maybe you
update the database, and that’s about it.</p>
<p>Here’s the graph, followed by some applications.</p>
<img src="Comparison-1.jpg" alt="Comparing Web Frameworks" />
<h2 id='p-2'>Scaling</h2>
<p>If you’re actually doing any computing, Java is obviously the fastest.  For
running web apps, the maximum scalability is probably about the same, because
there’s not much computing there.  After all, Java runs EBay while PHP runs
Wikipedia and Yahoo! Finance.  Both clearly scale “well enough”.</p>
<p>For Web apps, I’ve given PHP the edge, because I think building scalable
PHP is a little <em>easier</em>.  By default, PHP gives you a “shared-nothing”
(or at least “shared very little”) architecture, which means you’re going to
scale out pretty well until your database hits the wall.
Java is a much richer system and assumes you’re smart enough to know whether a
shared-nothing architecture is appropriate or not.  The effect is, you have to
be smarter to get the same kind of scaling out of Java.</p>
<p>As for Rails, I think it’s probably the case that you can build a Web-scale
app, just like Java and PHP, but we don’t know because nobody’s done it yet.
Also, we have to penalize Rails a bit because most apps end up having a little
computing in them, and Ruby is quite a bit behind the alternatives in that
department.</p> 
<h2 id='p-3'>Development Speed</h2>
<p>The question is “All other things being equal, how fast can I get my
Web app on the air?”  I think Rails has set a new benchmark here; you keep
hearing astounding stories of serious applications going up in days rather
than months and weeks rather than years.</p>
<p>Having said that, Rails’ sweet spot (CRUD-oriented greenfield apps) is
well-understood; but still, it seems obvious that Rails has some lessons to
teach that the rest of the frameworks would do well to learn from.
And I’d argue that the current direction of Java EE is evidence that that
learning is happening.</p>
<p>PHP’s original claim to fame was that it was the quick-and-dirty way to get a
Web app on the air.  There’s no point trying to sweep the “dirty” bit under
the carpet; a lot of those quickie PHP apps are butt-ugly.
One of the reasons Rails is interesting is that it’s quick <em>and clean</em>.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Developer Tools</h2>
<p>Application building and maintenance isn’t a sprint, it’s a marathon.
Your overall results in the long term are going to depend a lot on the quality
of your tools.  Happy developers are productive developers.</p>
<p>Java is the obvious winner here, by a mile.  Granted, Rails has TextMate and
PHP has the Zend stuff, and while there is work over in Eclipse to add support
for both PHP and Ruby.  But the comprehensive, integrated, polished, fast
support that a Java developer gets from NetBeans or Eclipse or Idea is miles
beyond any of these things.  I’m not really up-to-date on Eclipse or Idea, but
if you look at the recent NetBeans 5.5, the amount of automated support for
Web-app development is astounding; if I’d been graphing NetBeans instead of
Java, I suspect it’d have equaled or passed PHP in the development-speed
department.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Maintainability</h2>
<p>Good apps, once built, tend to be in production for an astonishingly long
time.  Which means that they have to be maintained for an astonishingly long
time.  Which means that maintainability is important.
There are a lot of things that go into maintainability, but I suggest that
the biggies are object-orientation, MVC architecture, 
code
readability, and code size (less is more, a lot more).</p>
<p>This is PHP’s  Achilles’ heel, of course.  Yes, it is possible to write
clean, object-oriented, modular, MVC-style PHP applications.  But most people
don’t; the majority of apps that I’ve seen have spaghetti PHP code
wrapped around spaghetti SQL embedded in spaghetti HTML. 
Also, a lot of the people who really understand O-O and MVC and maintainability
would rather work in Java or Rails.</p>
<p>I’ve put Rails ahead of Java just because there’s so much less code.  The
maintenance cost of code is strongly related to its size.  Clearly, Java’s
excellent developer tools make a difference, but still, I think that this is
another area where Ruby and Rails are teaching lessons the rest of the
industry would do well to learn from.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Omissions</h2>
<p>.NET and the Python frameworks, starting with Django, are notable by their
absence here.  Sorry; I just don’t have any first-hand knowledge on them.
And .NET isn’t open-source, so why would you use it?</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>Irritants</h2>
<p>I’ve already got people mad at me, because they think I said “PHP is faster
than Java” (I didn’t) and because I said Rails is faster to build and more
maintainable than PHP (I did, and I stand by it).</p>
<p>Obviously, there are edge
cases; I’m sure you can find examples where Rails runs faster than the
alternatives, or a Java app can be built fastest, or there are superb PHP dev
tools for some type of app, or there’s a horribly-architected unmaintainable
piece of Java framework crap.</p>
<h2 id='p-8'>What Matters?</h2>
<p>The question “Which of Java, PHP, and Rails is best?” is just silly.  The
answer, as with so many engineering questions, is “it depends”.  My personal
opinion is that for most Web apps, scaling isn’t really a good basis for
making a choice; if you have a decent application architecture, you can make
any of these scale enough, and if you don’t, you can’t.</p>
<img src="Comparison-2.jpg" alt="Importance of Web-framework issues" />
<p>In recent years things like PHP and Rails have taught us that development
speed is more important than we thought it was.  
On top of the obvious business value of delivering functions faster,
there’s the
Agile/XP view that you really don’t understand a feature till you’ve built it,
so the faster you can build them the faster you understand them.</p>
<p>Developer tool quality is something you ignore at your peril; application
development and maintenance is an endless grind, and you’re going to be a lot
happier at work, long-term, living in a tool like NetBeans or Eclipse.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s just because I’m a grizzled 25-year veteran, but my feeling is
that in the real world in the long term, maintainability is a really
<em>really</em> big deal, the biggest of all.</p>
<p>Out there in the wild woolly “Web 2.0” world, maybe getting it built quick is all
that matters, because after you’ve knocked ’em dead and been acquired, you can
use the money from the Yahoo! buy-out to rebuild everything right the second
time.
In the enterprise though, I kind of suspect that smart developers and smart
managers know that for real apps, the big development cost starts to happen
after they’re delivered.</p> 
<p>Whatever; you have to make your own choice based on your own application,
business, and people constraints.  That’s not controversial.</p>
<h2 id='p-9'>PS: Integration</h2>
<p>This stuff was only about half my talk.  The other half was about
integration; your stack’s internal integration, about integrating with
Identity technology, and about the general problem of heterogeneous framework
integration across the network.
That part was actually more interesting.</p>

<p>I don’t know why this tickles me so much, but it does:
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> is getting a couple of thousand visits a week from
people searching for “tea” or “cup of coffee” on Google Images.  
The
piece entitled, well, <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/03/30/Teacup">Tea</a>, is number one!  And for “cup of coffee”,
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/12/10/Brazza">A Damn Fine

Interestingly, neither of them show up anywhere near the top in the

In fact, typing those words in and seeing what the three engines produce is

<p>What happened was, I gave the talk in Frankfurt and
<a href="http://blog.thinkphp.de/">Björn Schotte</a> pulled out a couple of
slides for his blog, without much comment aside from saying the speech was
interesting.  TheServerSide.com ran a story whose title was a lie, without
talking to me or anyone, presumably looking for flameage, and they got some.
<a href="http://www.infoq.com/">InfoQ</a> approached it differently;
Floyd Marinescu emailed me, and I quote: “This blog <i>[pointing to Björn’s]</i> is 
starting to be noticed in the Java community and I thought it
would be more constructive for InfoQ to post a link to it including  a quote
from you on what you meant rather than post speculation/flamebait.”
So I wrote back “About to blog it.” and he wrote back “Hey,
do me a favor and answer a couple questions?” and I did, and Floyd wrote a
<a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2006/11/tim-bray-intrinsics">pretty good
piece</a> on the whole thing.

<title>Remembrance Day</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’ve always cared about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day">Remembrance Day</a>;
never been to war, but I’ve lived close to a couple and seen what happens when
the wrong people win one.  But here in Canada, those memories are growing dim;
my uncle
<a href="http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=collections/virtualmem/Detail&amp;casualty=2642271">Allen Scott</a> died in the Netherlands in 1944, but the number of people with
even that direct a connection to what we still call “The War” is growing
smaller (and I just came back from a pleasant visit to Germany, hanging out
with our former enemies).
That was until this decade. Now, our young people are falling in war in Afghanistan;
<a href="http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/focus/fallen/index_e.asp">these
ones</a>, I mean.  I’m touched to see that some of them are having their identities
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Forces_casualties_in_Afghanistan"> immortalized
online</a>; thanks to whoever’s doing that work.
The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban_insurgency">bad guys</a> in
Afghanistan are 
really genuinely bad; I don’t think there are many of us who object to taking
them on, or to trying to give the long-suffering Afghans a leg up.
Lots of Canadians are worried whether what we we’re trying to do
can be done; and it doesn’t help that our work in Afghanistan makes us a
nominal ally of one side in the botched, duplicitous, brutal war next door.
Whatever; Remembrance day is—or should be, anyhow—becoming more relevant, more
vital, more central.
But the troops that are important are the ones who are alive and working; if you’re
a Canadian you can 
<a href="http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/Community/Messageboard/index_e.asp">send
’em a message</a>; I assume other countries have similar systems.

<title>Java Is Free</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>When I took the job at Sun in early 2004, I had a long talk with John Fowler,
about this blog among other things.
John said: “You might end up happier if you don’t blog
about open-sourcing Java.”  That was then.  Today’s story is simple:
<em>Unmodified GPL2 for our SE, ME, and EE code.  GPL2 + Classpath exception
for the SE libraries. Javac and 
HotSpot and JavaHelp code drops today.  The libraries to follow, with pain expected
fighting through the encumbrances.  Governance TBD, but external committers
are a design goal.  No short-term changes in the TCK or JCP.</em>
There are a ton of presentations and an (excellent) FAQ and so on, all to show up at
<a href="http://www.sun.com/opensource/java">sun.com/opensource/java</a> 
sometime in the next few hours.
I wanted to add a couple of remarks on areas that stuff doesn’t highlight.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Why Free?</h2>
<p>I’m committed to Open Source but not generally a member of the Free Software
movement.  For Java, though, it’s the only thing that makes sense.  It’s been
given away freely for so long, and it’s worked its way into so many places, that
it should belong to the community, and if anyone figures out how to make it
better, they should just bloody well give that discovery back.
So for my money, the GPL’s the only sane choice.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>History</h2>
<p>There’s a lot of it, and I don’t know it, and I like it that way.  I’ve had
a few people say things like “I’ll never forgive Sun for what <i>[name deleted]</i> said
in 1998” or “The liaison from <i>[company deleted]</i> were lying bastards and
only in it to rape us.”  And so on.  Well, it’s history, it’s water under
the bridge, <em>forget it!</em></p>
<p>And I bet that nobody else will talk about this, so I will: there
was internal resistance, and it was passionate.   I
disagreed, but I have a lot of respect for those
people; they had good arguments that we need to keep carefully in mind,
going forward.
There are people who are bruised and hurting now and <em>really</em>
unsure that this is the right path.  I totally hope that, in a couple of
years, this will be a tempest in a teapot, seen in the rear-view mirror, and
that we’re still all on the same team.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Forks</h2>
<p>The FAQs argue that the risk of forking under the GPL is low;
the Free Software and OSS communities don’t want to; and given the
massive installed base of compatible Java, nobody seems likely to try a repeat
of the Microsoft shenanigans that we went to court over.</p>
<p>But I think there’ll be lots of forks, and I approve.
I suspect that basement hackers and university CompSci
departments and other unexpected parties will take the Java source, hack
groovy improvements into it, compile it, and want to give it to the world.
They’ll discover
that getting their creation blessed as “Java” requires running the TCK/trademark
gauntlet, which isn’t groovy at all.  So they’ll think of a clever name for it
and publish anyhow.</p>
<p>Which is terrific.  I see no downside, and I see huge upside in that
the Java mainstream can watch this kind of stuff and (because of the GPL)
adopt it if it’s good, and make things better for everybody.</p>
<p>Remember: However many forks there are, it ain’t 
Java unless it’s called “Java” or has the coffee-cup on it.  If it has the
name and cup, it <em>is</em> Java and it’s compatible.
And Sun <em>will
absolutely</em> enforce that in court if we have to.  We
have in the past and we will again.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>TCK</h2>
<p>What to do about the TCK code?  Its status is still TBD, and is 
going to take some careful thought.  Right now, the TCK is like the road test
that you have to pass to get your driver’s license.  It’s a hugely important
piece of the Java compatibility story.  It has to maintain its integrity and
it has to be <em>perceived</em> as maintaining its integrity.  So, what’s the
right licensing structure to achieve that?  Beats me.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Long Term?</h2>
<p>Anyone who tries to predict the long-term future effects of Free Java
is braver than me.  I have one concrete hope: that the people working on the
GNU/Linux desktop can be unshackled from the tyranny of C++.  Aside from that,
who knows?  Freedom is scary; but on balance I think Java’s new path will be
more interesting and more profitable and more fun.</p>

<title>5✭♫: Rough Mix</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is a 1977 album by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Townshend">Pete Townshend</a> of
the Who and the late
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Lane">Ronnie Lane</a> of the
Faces.
It’s a rarity in that most of it, while unquestionably rock music, is also
gentle.   Of its eleven songs, eight or nine are extremely beautiful, the singing is
tuneful and heartfelt, the playing (lots of
stars sitting in) is great, even the lyrics will grab you.
<i>(“5✭♫” series introduction <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music">here</a>;
with <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music#p-1">an
explanation</a> of why the title may look broken.)</i></p>
<img src="RM-cover-1.jpg" alt="Rough Mix, with Pete Townshend and Ronnie Lane" />
<h2 id='p-1'>The Context</h2>
<p>Pete Townshend doesn’t need any further introduction; obviously he’s one of
the giants of twentieth-century music (and this would be a
piece of evidence I’d use to support that claim).  Ronnie Lane,
though, was not seen one of the big Faces forces; his artful songwriting and
appealing singing on this were a surprise to me when I first ran across
it.
Lane was diagnosed with MS during the making of this recording; he lived
for another twenty years.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>The Package</h2>
<p>It looked great in the LP
format and doesn’t work on CD.  Pete and Ronnie have faces like two comfy old
shoes, which is truth in advertising because that’s how their voices sound
too.  The back of the LP was covered with pictures of a zillion little tiny cards, the
kind that must have come in packages of cereal or smokes or gum or whatever.</p>
<img src="RM-Cover-2.jpg" alt="Rough Mix, with Pete Townshend and Ronnie Lane" />
<h2 id='p-2'>The Music</h2>
<p>The arrangements are mostly acoustic, with a sprinkling of electric guitar
here and there; the band is mixed well back,  leaving lots of space for the
voices.  Those voices: middle-aged tarnished tenors, neither conventionally
beautiful, but with so much heart, and Ronnie exhibits some
surprising flexibility and verve.  Of the eleven songs, five are by Townshend,
two by Lane, two more by Lane-and-friends, one by Townshend and Lane, and then

<p>They mix up the vocals, singing their own songs, harmonizing, and on
Townshend’s luminous <cite>Heart To Hang Onto</cite>, trading off on verse and

<h2 id='p-5'>The Songs I Like, in Detail</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><cite>My Baby Gives it Away</cite> A light-hearted, tuneful, amusing song
about low-rent prostitution.</p>
<p><i>When you're alone in some city hotel,<br/>
You can get company by ringing a bell.<br/>
...<br/>
My baby's brother never break a your arm.<br/>
My baby ha, ha, I love her.</i></p></li>
<li><p><cite>Nowhere To Run</cite>  Beautiful harmonica from Peter Hope-Evans.
Lyric sample:</p>
<p><i>Make no sail for a gift of the wind<br/>
Drives you slow for this dream never ends...</i></p></li>
<li><p><cite>Rough Mix</cite> The band lays down a fast, gentle groove (yes, it’s
possible) and Eric Clapton plays fierce but relaxed lead (yes, it’s possible) 
over it.  Pete throws in a few licks that are mostly the spaces between the
notes.  You could dance to it.  What’s not to like?</p></li>
<li><p><cite>Annie</cite>, by Lane/Lambert/Clapton.  This song is so sweet and
sad, even 
one drink and you might find a tear falling. An unironic violin shadows the
melody, a good one.  Ronnie sings:</p>
<p><i>All those colors have faded<br/>
When ol' Jack comes to call<br/>
Don't tell him no, tell him maybe<br/>
Ohhhhh now, Annie, may God bless us all</i></p></li>
<li><p><cite>Keep Me Turning</cite>
Now this would be your vintage Townshend.  Lovely tune, the spiritual
anguish in the words is overdone but that’s OK because the guitar chords
are are excellent. </p></li>
<li><p><cite>Catmelody</cite> is a straightforward honky-tonk
barrelhouse party song, with Ronnie Lane gleefully slinking around and over
the surging piano and Charlie Watts backbeat:</p>
<p><i>This story's old, this heart is cold<br/>
This old street corner has heard it all before<br/>
But if I can bum just one more one<br/>
I'll say so long, I'm going home</i></p></li>
<li><p><cite>Misunderstood</cite> It’s crucial that Townshend sings this in a
gentle, ruminative, almost bashful voice over an acoustic backdrop.  It starts
like this and there are lots more verses, all about the same and all fun to
hear, over a really <em>really</em> eccentric rhythm, with tasty harmonica.</p>
<p><i>Just wanna be misunderstood<br/>
Wanna be feared in my neighborhood<br/>
Just wanna be a moody man<br/>
Say things that nobody can understand</i></p></li>
<li><p><cite>April Fool</cite>
A sad, beautiful Ronnie Lane song, maybe the most beautiful on the record.
Lots of acoustic guitars behind it with heartbreaking Dobro from Clapton, then
the singing stops and the guitars go on and on, soft and deep, I’m astounded that
nobody’s used this sequence in the climax of a movie romance, it’d make a
stone weep.  Ronnie sings:</p>
<p><i>I see the wheels there rusted in the backyard<br/>
I know we're not going anywhere<br/>
We used to roam so freely. It's been so long<br/>
I take my dreams to bed now where they belong</i></p></li>
<li><p><cite>Street in the City</cite>  Self-indulgent Townshend wanking,
with a full string orchestra no less behind it.  Having said that, it’s kind
of fun to listen to, music and words too  (<i>The news is written in the eyes
of us all</i>).  Intelligent wanking, I should have said.</p> </li>
<li><p><cite>Heart To Hang On To</cite>
This is one of my top favorite songs, ever, and I’ve learned to play it on a
bunch of different instruments over the years.
Ron sings the verses and Pete the chorus which is the title, and is there
anyone who doesn’t need a heart to hang on to?
The arrangement is pure magic; there are guitars and keyboards and all sorts
of stuff offering contributions precisely as needed, no more no less.</p></li>
<li><p>The last song is <cite>Till the Rivers All Run Dry</cite> and it’s here
because it was a big fave with whichever Indian guru was in fashion at the
time, Baba Rum Raisin I think.   Mostly harmless.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It seems that I’ve written up all the songs.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Sampling It</h2>
<p>What are you, crazy?  Go and buy the whole record, in an uncompressed form,
vinyl or bits, there have been very few aggregations of this many good songs,
in any format, ever.  Get the package deal.</p>

<title>The Morning After</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Well,
<a href="http://www.sun.com/software/opensource/java/">that</a> was quite a
party.  Herewith a few notes on communications, reactions, and names.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>How to Tell the World</h2>
<p>Here’s what we did:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Over the last couple of weeks, we did literally dozens of NDA briefings
with journalists and analysts.  I lost count, but think my count was nine or ten.</p></li>
<li><p>On the Sunday before, we had a teleconference for our bloggers, and
unleashed them at the same time the press embargo lifted: 9:01PM Pacific
on Sunday 12th (12 hours before the Monday-morning session).</p></li>
<li><p>On the Monday morning, we had a live meeting at the Sun campus, with a
Webcast.</p></li>
<li><p>There was a press session right after the Webcast.</p></li>
<li><p>We had an IRC get-together that we invited lots of tech bloggers to,
and then the whole Classpath community showed up.</p></li>
<li><p>We had a Second-Life press conference in the early afternoon.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I hit the “publish” button on
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/11/12/OSS-Java">Java Is Free</a> precisely at
9:01.  As a result, it got links from a few other early announcements, showed
up on Reddit and TechMeme and TailRank, and had over 16,000 direct views by
the end of Monday, plus ten or twenty thousand more via my Atom feed.</p>
<p>The IRC session was intense and, I hope, useful.  There were so many
threads going by so fast that I’m pretty sure we missed some good questions.  
I have to say, the love coming from the GNU/Java communities verges on the
embarrassing, in particular Dalibor Topic’s throwing promiscuous IRC hugs left and
right.</p>
<p>The Second Life thing, well, I don’t know.  It was a lot of work to get
going and it costs us real money, and then our pavilion can only hold 63
avatars, so the ROI seems questionable.  It got nice write-ups from
<a href="http://www.knowprose.com/node/16643">Taran Rampersad</a> (who in
Second Life is the <em>cutest</em> little penguin) and
<a href="http://www.illuminata.com/perspectives/?p=234">Jonathan Eunice</a>.
Absent the IRC confusion, the Q&amp;A flow was much more linear.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Reactions</h2>
<p>Most people seem pretty happy.  IBM officially 
<a href="http://news.com.com/2061-10795_3-6134853.html">sniffed and grumbled</a> 
because Java went GPL rather than Apache, but
<a href="http://www.sutor.com/newsite/blog-open/?p=1199">Bob Sutor was
gracious</a> and I’m pretty sure IBM will be present and constructive down the
road.</p>
<p>The press coverage has been generally friendly, even the perpetually grumpy
Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols allowing that it
<a href="http://www.linux-watch.com/news/NS4045253737.html">might not be too
late.</a>  Given that SJV-N’s normal approach to Sun involves ripping out bleeding
chunks of flesh, this is high praise indeed.</p>
<p>Simon Phipps has a
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/webmink/entry/kudos_and_grace">nice roundup</a>
of early reactions, including some that—impressively—occur as code not words;
way to go!</p> 
<p>Microsoft maven
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=101">Mary Jo Foley wonders</a>
what Redmond should do and polls her 
readers; I’m shattered to report that only 4% think that hiring me is their
best bet.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>*inj</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.snellspace.com/wp/?p=523">James Snell</a> is the first
to point out that all the non-compatible forks of Java will have to have names
ending in “INJ” for “is not Java”.  He proposes TINJ for “This is not Java”,
but the form is extensible: how about BINJ, HINJ, NINJ, SINJ, or WINJ?  I’d go
for Ninj myself, but time will tell.</p>

<p>Check out Jason Matusow’s
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jasonmatusow/archive/2006/11/11/your-input-requested.aspx">Your
Input Requested</a>, on the reaction to the recent
Microsoft-Novell deal.  Jason notes the push-back and seems to be saying that
some of it is reasonable and they’re willing to fine-tune.  But there’s this
one sentence that leaps off the screen at me: <i>We are not interested in
providing carte blanche clearance on patents to any commercial activity - that
is a separate discussion to be had on a per-instance basis.</i>  Oh really.
At one level that’s a tautology, but placed like this in the immediate context
of the Novell deal, it’s more than a little threatening.
It’s hard for me to imagine Microsoft firing a barrage of litigation, or even
of royalty demands, at a bunch of Linux developers or integrators or
packagers—that 
would be a nuclear first strike and who knows who’d be left standing—but then
strange things happen in this world.  
Maybe the nonspecific saber-rattling is the real point, just trying to create
enough not-unreasonable doubt in the minds of high-tech legal departments to
put a little drag on OSS business momentum.
Of course, they don’t say what the
patents that apply in this context are, but that’s not unique Microsoft evil,
it’s just the evil way that these things are usually done. 
<i>[Update:
<a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/microsoft/archives/108806.asp">Ballmer
confirms</a>: “the fact that that product uses our patented intellectual
property is a problem for our shareholders.”  And “anybody who has got Linux in their data center today sort of has an undisclosed balance sheet liability”]</i></p>

<title>RX Redux</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Thanks to the commenters on
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/11/09/Optimizing-Ruby">the previous RX
piece</a> who recommended <code>ruby-prof</code> (there’s a gem install), which
is a much faster and thus better profiler than the built-in one.  I learned a
few more things.</p>
<p>The commenter who hit closest to the mark was
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/11/09/Optimizing-Ruby#c1163516919.120060">Aristotle
Pagaltzis</a>, who references
<a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=241385">Perl lore</a>: “The
fastest way to do something in Perl is frequently the one that implements the
most costly step in the fewest ops.”  The reasons will be obvious on a little
thought, but the PerlMonks piece is worth reading.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Looping Blues</h2>
<p>When I run the parser over 2,477,645 bytes of XML, because of the 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/11/09/Optimizing-Ruby#p-6">buffer-skipping
trick</a> it only actually has to look at 484,021 characters individually,
and that loop still burns 25% of the 13 seconds it takes on my PowerBook.  I’ve
looked at it pretty hard, sliced and diced the loop two or three
different ways with the profiler, and squeezed a few improvements out, but at
the end of the day, it’s pretty simple sensible code.   For now, my conclusion is
that the current Ruby implementation is just not gonna be fast enough in
<em>any</em> algorithm that requires looking individually at a nontrivial
proportion of the characters.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Packing Blues</h2>
<p>The other problem is that RX internally processes XML text as an array of
numeric values identifying Unicode characters; but APIs are going to want to
deal with Ruby strings, so the arrays have to be run through <code>pack</code>
before handing data to whatever API is in use.
This hurts; <code>Array#pack</code> was burning 11%
of my time.  What puzzled me was that <code>Integer#to_int</code> (a
no-op) was getting called 2,354,147 times and burning another 6.59%. </p>
<p>So I poked around and it turns out that <code>any_array.pack('U*')</code>
calls <code>to_int</code> on each element; duck-typing culture at work.</p>
<p>If there were such a notion as an array known to contain only Fixnums, or a
<code>pack</code>-type operation that was allowed to throw an exception if its
arguments weren’t Fixnums, things might be better.</p>
<p>Now, in the case where the input is already UTF-8, there’s a chance for a
special-purpose hack to avoid the String->Array->String round-trip, but that
feels both brutal and discriminatory.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The notion of picking one of the libxml or expat based Ruby libraries and
maintaining it properly and blessing that as the “right” way to do XML in Ruby
is looking better and better.</p>

<p>I feel guilty sometimes about the lull in my WS-Rants, because the forces

<p>We’re only three weeks away from
<a href="http://2006.xmlconference.org/">XML 2006</a>.  Which brings to mind that it
was ten years ago at that same conference (different name then) that we showed
the world
the first draft of the XML spec.  It was a carefully-staged event, and one of
the most intense 45 minutes in my life.  Ah... Back to this year.  Looks like
David Megginson has put together a program that is notably free of the usual
suspects and rich with new stuff.  I see presenters from Google and the Motley
Fool, and on PHP and (my goodness) JSON.  Looks very good.</p>

<title>Bad Weather</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>You don’t really expect much from the weather up here in the November
Pacific Northwest, but boy, it’s been brutal.
We’re way past the average rainfall for the month and we’ll probably set a
record; enough Wednesday to dump landslides into
<a href="http://vancouver.metblogs.com/archives/2006/11/quick_geography_lesson.phtml">the reservoirs</a> and
now we’re all drinking boiled water.
Trees down in the wind, and a four-story steel-frame building under
construction.
Nobody hurt on that one—it was at night—but you gotta feel sorry for the
guys who showed up to work on the site in the morning.
I took a picture outside my office.</p>
<img src="IMG_5118.jpg" alt="Bad weather in Vancouver" />
<div class="caption"><p>It gets dark early; this is about 4PM (egregiously
Photoshopped).</p></div> 
<p>To make things worse, they’re building new sidewalks on the street where my
office is; there’s another bunch of construction workers to feel sorry for.
The
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/11/30/Lustrous">store downstairs</a> is

<p>I’m having trouble, this
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/11/17/Brutal-Weather">dingy Friday
afternoon</a>, with episodic random defocusing.
I don’t listen to music when there’s a chance of serious work happening; right now I’m

M. Moreno or M. Robert, but I sure like the music they pick.  
It’s deliciously eclectic, which in practice means 
ridiculously corny sometimes; but in a good way.  Just now they were playing

is appropriate given what’s going on outside.</p>

<title>The Week After</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A few browser tabs have built up with follow-ons from last week’s
<a href="http://www.sun.com/software/opensource/java/getinvolved.jsp">Java
source code</a> news. 
The best single day-after piece is Mark Reinhold’s
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/mr/entry/behind_the_scenes">There’s not a moment
to lose!</a>; I was on that IRC channel for the “Vijay is on it” moment.
Mark also points at
<a href="http://javaposse.com/index.php?post_id=151153">Java Posse</a>
coverage.  I listened to it and ten minutes in was getting dubious, there
wasn’t much new news.  But about halfway through they started getting
technical; as in, is building the JDK more like building Linux (easy) or like
building OpenOffice.org (hard)?  Listen for details.
Then there’s an 
<a href="http://www.eclipsemag.net/ecm/ecmnews/psecom,id,382,nodeid,2.html">interview with me</a> in
<cite>Eclipse Magazine</cite>.
Two amusing points:  when Sebastian Meyen
sent me the questions, he mentioned half a dozen different web sites
and magazines they might run it in, but not <cite>Eclipse mag</cite>
(Sebastian, it’s just fine); also, 
contrast the fanciful article title
and my answer to the community-models question.  Speaking of Eclipse and
snickers, there’s Mike Milinkovich
<a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=194300265">telling
Information Week</a> that we made the open-source move in reaction to
<a href="http://harmony.apache.org/">Harmony</a>.  Look, Eclipse is an
important part of the Java ecosystem, and Harmony is an interesting project with
really smart people, but gimme a break.  
You might want to look past the conspiracy
theories and industry tectonics, and consider a
<a href="http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2006-04/sunflash.20060424.2.xml">simpler
explanation</a>.
Moving on: I took my daily glance at Slashdot today and damn if
there isn’t a great big honking get-the-Java-source-code ad all up and down
the right sidebar.
I would never have thought of doing that, and I don’t claim to understand the
advertising strategy or tactics; but seeing it made me happy.
Closing note: You have no idea how much work this has been, for a whole lot of
our best people; my hat is off to ’em.</p>

<title>On Attacking Iran</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There’s a term in Political Science that I’m looking for (and if the
LazyWeb speaks up, I’ll re-write this to accommodate it).  It’s the technique
of gradually shifting the center of a debate, first by introducing notions
previously unthinkable at the edge, then gradually moving them towards
plausibility.  It seems to be happening right now, with the objective of dragging
aggressive war against Iran to stage center.  Just this last weekend, the LA
Times ran an opinion piece with the admirably-straightforward title
<a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-op-muravchik19nov19,0,5419188.story?coll=la-home-commentary">Bomb
Iran</a>, and Ha’aretz was right behind them in line with
<a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=789940&amp;contrassID=1&amp;subContrassID=1">Bush: I would understand if Israel chose to attack Iran</a>.
There’s even a schedule: <i>In recent talks with their Israeli counterparts,
French government officials estimated that Iran would reach the “point of no
return” in its nuclear program by spring 2007, in approximately five
months.</i>
I am no lover of the corrupt theofascist oppressors in
Tehran; and I suspect that nearly everyone agrees that we lose every time
nuclear weapons cross another border.  But still, are we so blind to history
that anybody believes that such an attempt will succeed; or, whether
succeeding or failing, improve the situation?
<i>[Update: The term I was looking for was

<title>Kill Switch Nightmare</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/">Mary Jo Foley</a> (who has been
excellent recently, a must-read) reports that both
Windows Vista and Office 2007 
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=111">have a “Kill Switch”</a>; if
you can’t prove you’re properly licensed, the software turns itself off.
Maybe I’m missing something, but this seems like complete batshit-looney territory.
Let’s see, suppose I’m a black-hat profiteer sitting beyond
the reach of Western law but with control over a few
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet">botnets</a>.  If I can
get my hands on your Kill Switch, I’ll have a nice little extortion business, as in
“Pay up or all your desktops will decide they’re unlicensed and turn off.”
It’d work best in a sales-centric business near end-of-quarter.
Another potential victim would be any government (or company even) that has a
lot of enemies; they don’t want your money, they just want to take you down.
So, without thinking too hard, here are some attack vectors I’d consider:
If I can subvert your network routing, <em>gotcha!</em>  If I can subvert the
registry on your desktop machines, <em>gotcha!</em>  If I can subvert the NTP
protocol (how most computers learn what time it is), <em>gotcha!</em>  I’m sure
that an actual seasoned network engineer could think up a half-dozen more
attack scenarios over a cup of coffee.
Finally, never ascribe to malice that which can be explained by incompetence;
WGA is software and software has bugs and if one of those bugs flipped the
Kill Switch on your sales infrastructure offline during the Christmas rush,
well, there wouldn’t be any malice involved, but it’d sure be a pity.
What prudent businessperson, I wonder, is going to install critical infrastructure that
can be turned off remotely, trusting the claims that only the good guys
will be able to find the key to the “off” switch?

<p><span class='o'>ongoing</span> has had comments for a couple of months now;
I’m really happy with the way it’s worked out, so, first of all, <em>Thank
you!</em> to the people who are doing it;  I checked this morning and there’ve been
449 contributions.  The quality is by and large high; for example, in the last
day, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/11/20/WGA-Nightmares">Kill Switch
Nightmare</a> got a really smart 
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/11/20/WGA-Nightmares#c1164057312.258661">comment
from Colin Jeanne</a> pointing out that for the bad guys, there may be easier
and deadlier attack vectors than the Vista/Office “Kill Switch”.  And somewhat
to my surprise,
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/11/20/On-Attacking-Iran#c1164049489.589824">Bob
Aman responded</a> to

Attacking Iran</a>, taking the other side of the issue and demonstrating that
not everyone who’s considering this is a complete fruit-loop.
Yes, they’re still moderated; I’d like to turn that off, but I watch everyone
I know on commercial packages burning time and cycles battling the
ever-mounting spam wave, and I get scared.  Call me a chicken.  Cluck-cluck.
I’ve got a to-do list for a dozen minor improvements, all suggested by you
(thanks!); I’ll get to them.</p>

<p>That
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/11/17/Brutal-Weather">bad weather</a> I wrote
about a couple weeks ago is still bad, the baby and I are both sick; things
could be lots worse but complaining is a sacred human right.  With
pictures.</p>
<p>Wind and rain and wind and rain and wind and rain.   There was an episode of
what they call “sunlight” the other day and I snapped this moderately-pretty
tree across the street.</p>
<img src="IMG_5121.jpg" alt="Tree with a few yellow leaves left" />
<p>A couple of nasty windy days later those yellow leaves are gone; here’s
that same tree and its neighbor at sunset.</p>
<img src="IMG_5122.jpg" alt="Autumn sunset, Vancouver" />
<p>The baby girl is having her first cold; it started out with a maybe-related
eye infection; she looked like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marty_Feldman">Marty Feldman</a> with a
hangover, or like someone who came out on the short end of a long boxing
match.
Now her eyes are better, but she’s congested and can’t eat properly and can’t
sleep properly and so neither can we, and she gave me the cold too so I feel 
like severely sleep-deprived crap; Lauren is getting less sleep than me and
needs more, so it’s not good all around.</p>
<p>Down South they’re having Thanksgiving, thank goodness, it means not much
email or telephone traffic, I can prop myself up in front of the computer and 
pretend half-heartedly to work.</p>
<p>And thanks are due, she’s basically a healthy baby and in a few more days
we’ll be enjoying her twinkling smiley eyes again.</p>

<title>RX + YARV</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’m in about round eight of my duel with Ruby, trying to make a correct
automaton-based parser run as fast as a regexp-based one that has a casual
attitude toward the rules.  (Our story thus far
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/11/09/Optimizing-Ruby">here</a> and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/11/15/RS-Redux">here</a>.)
I thought I’d try out
<a href="http://www.atdot.net/yarv/">YARV</a>, the heir-apparent Ruby VM.
<i>[Update: Hah! Improved RX a little more.]</i>
</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>More RX</h2>
<p>I’d added one more optimization since the last report: when the parser
wants to assemble
characters into UTF-8 strings to pass to the API, it gets them from the input
subsystem, since if the input were already in UTF-8, there’s a chance to dodge 
string recomposition overhead.  It bought about 20% on large
UTF-8 input documents.</p>
<p><i>[Update, Friday night.]</i>  I was trying to check out JRuby timings and
something wasn’t working; a closer look at the code revealed 
a bone-headed programming error that was doing a useless (and expensive)
rexexp match on every buffer refresh.  The numbers below are a little better.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Ruby 2 Breakage</h2>
<p>There will be some incompatible changes in Ruby 2.  One of the most visible
is that indexing into a string returns a one-character string, as opposed to
the value of the byte thus indexed.
I think that in general I probably approve of this behavior, and most programs
that it breaks will probably be getting what they deserve, since they were
probably heading for an i18n brick wall anyhow.</p>
<p>Of course, RX used strings to hold the automaton itself and a couple of
related data structures, so they all had to have <code>.bytes.to_a</code>
applied, and all the numeric references are into <code>Fixnum</code> arrays,
not strings, which I’d like to think is cheap, but I haven’t measured yet.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>TDD Rah Rah</h2>
<p>Refactoring the code to deal with the new String regime wasn’t that tricky,
but I bow my head in the general direction of whichever deity governs Unit
Testing.  If I hadn’t had a fairly decent set of input-subsystem tests, it
would have been nightmarish, automaton-based parsers being fairly tricky to
debug.</p> 
<h2 id='p-3'>The Numbers</h2>
<p>Once again, the benchmark is 2,477,645 bytes of 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> source text; the code counts the number of PIs,
Elements, <code>p</code> elements, <code>img</code> elements whose
<code>src</code> attribute points at something ending in <code>jpg</code>, and
occurrences of the word “the” in running text.</p>
<p>The numbers are averages of a few runs, and consider only “user” CPU time
as reported by Mac OS X.  Units are seconds, smaller is better.</p>
<table cellpadding="5">
<tr>
	<td class='etd'></td>
	<th>RX</th>
	<th>REXML</th>
	<th>Δ</th>
</tr>
<tr align="right">
	<th>Ruby 1.8.5</th>
	<td>11.53</td>
	<td>4.52</td>
	<td>2.55</td>
</tr>
<tr align="right">
	<th>YARV 0.4.1</th>
	<td>6.99</td>
	<td>3.08</td>
	<td>2.27</td>
</tr>
<tr align="right">
	<th>Δ</th>
	<td>1.65</td>
	<td>1.47</td>
	<td class='etd'></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>This is fairly self-explanatory; RX and REXML both got a shot in the arm
from YARV; RX’s was a little bigger, so it’s not quite as far behind REXML as
it used to be.</p>
<p>Frankly, I’m disappointed.  I’d have thought that if there’s anywhere a
VM, as opposed to an interpreter, ought to do well, it’s this kind of
stripped down array-lookup-and-dispatch code.</p>
<p>Next step; track down what they use for profiling in YARV-land, and find
out what’s going on.

<p>There’s been much jawing about David Pogue’s claim in the <cite>New York
Times</cite> that
<a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/11/21/21pogues-posts-2/">5
megapixels is enough</a>.   He didn’t just claim it, he claims to have
<em>proved</em> it.  I think he may have a point, but the quality of evidence
is crappy.
First of all, he doesn’t say where the 13MP picture came from
(probably a pretty high-end camera), nor how he photo-reduced it (PhotoShop and
friends have all sorts of smart anti-aliasing), nor how the print enlarging
was done (are the results comparable to the ones you’re going to get at your
local print-shop?)  It would have been way more interesting if he’d taken a two
carefully-composed pictures, one with a 5MP camera and one with a bigger one,
had them both photo-enlarged at the nearest drug-store, and compared those.
Also, he ignores a real advantage of having more pixels; you can crop a
picture way down to focus on the interesting parts and still have enough
pixels to look good.  Weirdly, he also fails to point out the
<em>downside</em> of bigger pictures; they’re slower to transfer, edit, and
display on-screen.  So this is hardly a triumph of journalism.  In this week’s
other photo-news, the much-ballyhooed
<a href="http://www.leica-camera.us/photography/m_system/m8/">Leica M8</a>,
maybe the world’s most expensive consumer digicam, turns out to have
<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0611/06112402leicam8fixes.asp">quality
issues</a>.
I still want one; but that would be unforgivably self-indulgent, I’ll only
award myself one as a prize, say if I manage to bring peace to the Middle East, or (even
tougher) make my Ruby parser go fast.</p>

<title>A Canadian Evening</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>That cold has now struck down ¾ of the family, so we stayed inside this
afternoon and evening, and watched Hockey Night in Canada 
[<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/">home</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_Night_in_Canada">Wikipedia</a>]
which is
pretty central to who we are here.</p>
<p>It works like this: they show two games.  In
the first intermission, they have
<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/hnic/coachs-corner.html">Coach’s
Corner</a>, featuring
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Cherry_%28hockey%29">Grapes</a>
and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_MacLean">Ron</a> in a
buffoonish, over-the-top set piece that they’ve been  polishing these last
twenty years and it’s probably past its best-by date, but still worth a laugh
sometimes.</p>
<p>This evening, when the 2nd intermission came around I was cooking dinner
and thus listening to “Satellite Hotstove” in the background and just enjoying
the sound of half-a-dozen middle-aged Canadian male accents in a light-hearted
but erudite discussion of the game’s internals; if you don’t know who Lou
Lamoriello or Guy Carbonneau are, they’re not going to stop to explain, but
you’ll learn a whole lot about hockey, listening.</p>
<p>To make the evening really Canadian, an unusual (for here) winter
snowfall set in, Mother Nature apparently trying to make November 2006 the crappiest
weather month on record for Vancouver.  As I type this, nearing midnight, the
snow is ankle-high and starting to stick alarmingly; I bet there’ll be power
failures by morning.</p>
<p>One of the snow casualties was our satellite dish, so we didn’t get to
watch the second game; oh well, time to hit the sack and try to get better.</p>

<title>Choose RELAX Now</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Elliotte Rusty Harold’s
<a href="http://cafe.elharo.com/xml/relax-wins/">RELAX Wins</a> may be a
milestone in the life of XML.  Everybody who actually touches the technology
has known the truth for years, and it’s time to stop sweeping it under
the rug.  W3C XML Schemas (XSD) suck.  They are hard to read, hard to write,
hard to understand, have interoperability problems, and are unable to describe
lots of things you want to do all the time in XML.  Schemas based on Relax NG,
also known as ISO Standard 19757, are easy to write, easy to read, are backed
by a rigorous formalism for interoperability, and can describe immensely more
different XML constructs.  To Elliotte’s list of important
XML applications that are RELAX-based, I’d add the
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4287">Atom Syndication Format</a> and,
pretty soon now, the Atom Publishing Protocol.
It’s a pity; when XSD came out people thought that since it came from the W3C,
same as XML, it must be the way to go, and it got baked into a 
bunch of other technology before anyone really had a chance to think it over.
So now lots of people say “Well, yeah, it sucks, but we’re stuck with it.”  <i>Wrong!</i>
The time has come to declare it a worthy but failed
experiment, tear down the shaky towers with XSD in their foundation,
and start using RELAX for all significant XML work.

<p>That would be Bill Clementson, in
<a href="http://notlog.blogspot.com/2006/11/bill-clementsons-blog.html">
Concurrent/Parallel Programming - The Next Generation</a>.  I’ve been working
on so much other stuff that the concurrency’s kind of been crowded out.  Which
isn’t good, because the 
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/Concurrency/">highly-parallel future</a>
hasn’t stopped getting closer, and I just haven’t heard that much exciting concurrency
news recently.  Except from Google, where MapReduce and Sawzall may be
pointing one of the ways forward.  I actually did a little fooling around with
Erlang (damn, that is one heavyweight install) and there’s a lot to like, but I don’t think the world is ready to give up object-orientation.
There’s low-hanging fruit out there, and lots of pieces of the solution are
in plain view, and we know where we’re trying to go: to a place
where ordinary application programmers’ code naturally and effortlessly takes
advantage of multi-core, multi-processor, clustered, or otherwise parallel
hardware deployments.  Because scaling out, rather than scaling up, is still
the future.</p>

<title>The Colours of Snow</title>

<p>We’ve had a lot of snow and and a long freeze to keep it on the ground.
All those shades of white and grey pulled the camera out of my pocket as much as any
summer day’s flowers, this year.</p>
<p>Our magnolia, much-featured here in every shade of pink and violet, cannot
be anything but beautiful, any time of year.</p>
<img src="IMG_5127.jpg" alt="Snow-covered magnolia limbs" />
<p>I had a 20th-floor meeting downtown, with a view of two
construction sites.  There’s a lot of geometry in this one.</p>
<img src="IMG_5131.jpg" alt="Snow-covered downtown Vancouver construction site" />
<p>The second site was at first less interesting; I was looking down at the top
of the big crane, then saw the two guys walking around on it,
fixing something or other, hundreds of feet up on snowy steel at -6°C.  Look close and
you’ll see them.  
I’m not complaining about my job today, I think.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.webmink.net/">Simon Phipps</a> pointed me at 
<a href="http://techp.org/petition/show/1">Protest the Microsoft-Novell Patent
Agreement</a>, 
saying “The emotion is remarkable”, and he’s right, it is.  
The more I thought about that deal the less I worried about it.  Sure,
software patents being what they are, GNU/Linux, like every nontrivial chunk
of code, doubtless infringes lots.  So who’s Microsoft gonna sue?
Any large-scale Linux user is also a large-scale Microsoft customer; that
would be bad for business.  They could go after Red Hat or Canonical, but
that’d end up hurting their customers, helping Sun, and
anyhow you could no more squish Linux that way than you can squeeze water in
your fist. 
“Never ascribe to malice that which can be explained by incompetence” they
say, and it’s true too;
so maybe some Redmond strategist thought the 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/11/15/Microsoft-Linux-Patents">vague FUD
cloud</a> would actually move the needle.
Well, it has; but perhaps not quite as planned.</p>

<p>What happened was, <em>very</em> shortly before last month’s 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/11/02/Startup-Camp">Startup Camp</a>,
they started cooking up this idea of 
<a href="http://www.sun.com/startupessentials">selling Sun gear really cheap to
startups</a>.
Someone asked “Can we announce it in conjunction with that camp?” and the
answer was “Well, uh...”, so 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/11/02/Startup-Essentials">we did</a>.
So, we all of a sudden had a bunch of people wanting in, and our lawyers told
us “You have to exercise due diligence to make sure they really are real
startups” and someone had to cook up a process out of nowhere double-quick.
It seems to be working; yesterday Adam Kalsey got approved and
<a href="http://kalsey.com/2006/11/sun_startup_essentials_pricing/">dumped the
numbers</a>.   I saw it and thought “Hah, gotta blog that” but

<title>Intel Java Voodoo Huh?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Check out
<a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=24781">Intel's new
instructions to Rockton round the clock</a> from <cite>the Inquirer</cite>.
This is consistent with what
<a href="http://blogs.codehaus.org/people/geir/">Geir Magnusson</a> said in
his (very good) OSCON presentation; that Intel might like to load a
custom JVM with secret code that took advantage of
their inside knowledge of the silicon, so Java would run better on Intel; one
reason they might have preferred Apache to GPL licensing for the Sun Java code.
Me, I’m puzzled.  If there are special instructions to make Java bytecodes (or
.NET CLR code) run fast, uh, how are they going to keep them secret, and why
wouldn’t they end up in <em>every</em> JVM and CLR implementation?
And why wouldn’t this be good for Intel? 
There are disassemblers and so on, you know, and plenty of hackers who are
accomplished at picking apart x86 binaries.
Maybe there’s something else we don’t know.

and Geir Magnusson says I’m all wrong about Intel.

<p>The news is not all bad.  Take a minute-really, even if you’re
busy—and watch
<a href="http://mediastorm.org/0011.htm">Iraqi Kurdistan</a>, built around 
photographs by Ed Kashi; it’s beautiful.  There’s at least one part of Iraq
where people are getting on with living their lives.  One of the first pieces
I ever wrote here was called
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/14/Kurds">Kurds</a>; it’s come out better
than I predicted.
Enough good news.  
I think Fareed Zakaria has it about right in 
<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15897617/site/newsweek/">The Next Step?
Think Vietnam</a>; Iraq is slipping into sectarian war, and the
murderers on both sides would like the US to leave because they think they can
win the bloodbath that comes next.
Even <a href="http://www.economist.com/debate/democracyinamerica/2006/11/annan_and_bono_to_run_iraq.cfm">The
Economist</a> (in their excellent new <cite>Democracy in
America</cite> blog) says “In the end we’re going to have to accept the fragmentation
of Iraq”.   If I were religious I’d be praying for the Iraqis; nobody deserves this.
Those, like me, who thought the war wasn’t insane were guilty of
failing to apply Occam’s razor.  
The simplest explanation in 2003 was that the war-starters were incompetent lying
scum and that no good result could be expected from their actions.  And the
simplest explanation was true.
Oh well, it doesn’t help the people in the Middle East, but for those of us
who really want to know what’s going on, both
<a href="http://www.haaretz.com/">Ha’aretz</a> and
<a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/">Al-Jazeera</a> now have decent

<a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/">here</a> and Ha’aretz
<a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/objects/pages/rss.html">lists a
bunch</a>.
Thanks to Dave Winer for the
<a href="http://www.scripting.com/2006/11/27.html#alJazeeraInTheUs">Al-Jazeera
link</a>; I wasn’t sure what to expect from them, but they’re useful.
So far nothing has been offensive and occasionally there’s a surprising outburst
of humor: they were the first with the

newspaper-depth, but still, the more voices the better.
Hmm, maybe praying works even if you don’t believe?  Let’s hope.</p>

<p>The animation in Web display ads is outta
control, <em>outta control, I tell ya!</em>  They slither and shake and squirm
and flash and jitter and morph and I’m gonna start
bleeding from the eyeballs.  I’ve always eschewed ad-blockers and
Flash-blockers, because advertising <em>should</em> be part of the ecosystem; but
things have gone too far.
Ads in magazines don’t offend me in the slightest, I even enjoy some,
have even been informed about something I might buy.
But on the Web... my instinct tells me that these things not only hurt my
brain, they can hardly be achieving the intended effect. </p>

<title>Liberal Oratory</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>In Canada, we have three significant political parties. The right-wing
Conservatives (Tories) occasionally get to form the government (like
now, for instance).
The centrist Liberals are sometimes called “the natural governing party” and
have definitely spent more years in office; at the moment they’re in
opposition after getting a well-deserved spanking
from the voters over a nasty little corruption scandal.  Then there’s
social-democratic NDP.
The Liberals are currently having a convention to pick their next leader,
quite possibly our next Prime Minister.  Tonight we had the big speeches from
all eight (!) candidates and the first ballot.
Probably of interest only to Canadian-politics fans.</p>
<p>All the red—T-shirts, ribbons, ties, dresses, faces—makes for good TV.
The Liberals’ historic tight interlock with the immigrant communities is
obvious, looking at the convention floor.</p>
<p>What’s the deal with the candidate videos?  If I were a delegate I’d be pissed; I can
watch the video at home any time; this was the chance to hear them set the air
in vibration with their own lungs; if I were one of them, I’d take every
available minute to talk live.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>The Second Tier</h2>
<p><i>Martha Hall Findlay</i> She’s sincere, lovable, appealing, but just not
that great a speaker.  The implicit indictment—the only woman on the platform
is a no-hope trailer—is pretty stinging.</p>
<p><i>Scott Brison</i>  A good speaker, handles his voice well, and an
appealing guy.
He turned his
speech into a powerful environmentalist global-warming pitch; not a hard one
to make, these days.  A few enjoyable zingers:  “Quoting Bill Clinton, It’s
the <em>green</em> economy, stupid!”  
He said that green business was potentially another Klondike: “A green rush”.  “What’s
Harper saying about the environment this week?  What did the Bush White House say
last week?”
Maybe he’s got himself a crack at the environment portfolio in some future
Liberal government.</p>
<p><i>Joe Volpe:</i> I could hardly bring myself to listen to this pathetic
hack, and when I did tune in there was nothing there: clichés delivered
without benefit of rhythm or flow. </p>
<p><i>Ken Dryden:</i>  He’s not much of a speaker, his face and voice both slow
and heavy.  I appreciate his attempt at a poetic invocation of Canada,
starting with sunrise in Newfoundland.  And the single best piece of language
construction; his pieces-of-Canada rap veered from exalted and touchy-feely to
gritty and funny, meeting someone down on his luck at 10PM outside Vancouver’s
safe-injection center, who said “Hey, Ken Dryden!  He shoots, he scores!”
(Canadians will know why this is funny.)
He came alive quite a bit on global warming, and had a few good lines:  “We
don’t like the poor being poor”.  “This is a find-a-way world; we’re a
find-a-way country.  The answers aren’t in ideologies.” </p>
<p>And now on to the evening’s big stars.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Stéphane Dion</h2>
<p>His warm-up act, some recently-elected Ontario MP,  banged the
environmental drum; maybe a little too long, since Dion ran out of time.
Dion’s probably my fave candidate just because he’s so smart and strong on the
issues and it’s possible to believe he’s in it largely for reasons of
public-spiritedness.</p>
<p>His good lines were mostly in eloquent French: “There’s more culture in a
bowl of yogurt than the Conservative government.”
“Tories don’t really like government; since we Liberals are compassionate,
we should show them some compassion and run them out of government.”</p>
<p>In English he said “We have a Prime Minister who thinks that child-care is
delivered through the mailbox” and “The
economy and the environment; the people and the planet” and 
“There are three pillars: the market economy, social justice, and the
environment. 
The NDP doesn’t understand the market economy, and the Conservatives don’t
understand social justice.”</p> 
<p>His English is maybe
weak enough to hurt 
his electability; but Lauren said  “His accent’s kind of cute”.</p>
<p>He echoed Brison’s line about there being good money, as well as good
morals, in green business, saying Canada has a chance to be a leader.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Gerard Kennedy</h2>
<p>I hated most of this speech; it was polished polished polished polished;
but mostly just the mouthing of platitudes.  
His real message is “I can win an election” which many say is the core of what
the Liberals are about.  He would be, as he pointed out, 
“the first Liberal leader born and raised in Western Canada;
will not spot the Tories 80 seats west of Kenora.” </p>
<p>In his closing minutes, he came alive
talking about his lengthy food-bank experience (which is a credit to him), and
the general decency of people, given a chance.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Bob Rae</h2>
<p>On the upside, he didn’t have anyone to introduce him, but on the downside,
his video was way too long.  He spoke without a teleprompter, walking free on
stage, which I thought worked well.</p>
<p>His speech was smooth and powerful, with good rhythm.  
But he wasn’t saying that much. </p>
<p>He made a good point along the lines of “Yes, those guys are right about the
environment, but we need to convince Canadians to be green not just in general
but in particular.”</p>
<p>I can’t actually remember much of what he said, but he came across as
grown-up, trustworthy, smart; a safe pair of hands, maybe?   He really should
have spoken more French, though, because when he did, it wasn’t too bad.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Michael Ignatieff</h2>
<p>He’s carrying a ton of baggage because he’s never really lived in Canada as
an adult, but he’s obviously a smart and accomplished guy, and when you’re
hiring a CEO, it’s a good idea to look for someone with connections.</p>
<p>Another overly-long video.
I thought he was great-looking but Lauren was unimpressed.
He had a good opening; “Tonight’s the night the Liberal party begins again”
and his mix of English and French was elegant.</p>
<p>At the beginning of his speech his words were weirdly slow, but he warmed
up and I thought delivered the sharpest political oratory of the night.</p>
<p>“The party of hope—<i>le parti d’espoir</i>—and hope begins with
opportunity.
Opportunity has to begin with education... we must be the party that says to
every young Canadian who wants to go to college: ‘You get the grades, you get
to go.’”
“We must put a price on pollution and on carbon emission and we will.”</p>
<p>I thought his getting two call-and-responses going, one in French, was
good political theater.  He touched one traditional Liberal button:
“National Unity is the Liberal Party’s most important work; it always has
been and it always will be.” But then stepped outside with “Let’s win some
seats in Alberta.”</p> 
<p>His Tory-bashing was not as effective as the others.  But still, a pretty
good speech.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Results, First Ballot</h2>
<div class="caption">
<table>
<tr align="center"><td></td><th>Votes</th><th>%</th></tr>
<tr align="right"><td>Ignatieff</td><td>1412</td><td>29.3</td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td>Rae</td><td>977</td><td>20.3</td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td>Dion</td><td>856</td><td>17.8</td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td>Kennedy</td><td>854</td><td>17.7</td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td>Dryden</td><td>238</td><td>4.9</td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td>Brison</td><td>192</td><td>4.0</td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td>Volpe</td><td>156</td><td>3.2</td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td>Findlay</td><td>130</td><td>2.7</td></tr>
</table>
</div><p></p>
<p>Findlay’s dropped from the next ballot and Volpe went to Rae.</p>
<p>What does it mean?  Nobody knows.  Since people think Dion’s speech was
poor, he would have been hurting, except for he managed to squeak past Kennedy
into third place.  Ignatieff significantly under-performed expectations; the
conventional wisdom is that he has little growth potential.</p>
<p>Nobody, <em>nobody</em>, has a useful prediction for the second ballot.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Me, I’d bet on Rae vs. Dion in the last ballot, and think the Liberals
would do OK with either.  But that’s not the key take-away.</p>
<p>What’s important is that this is wonderful, gripping, political theater,
the tired whorish old Liberal party has managed to put on its best clothes and
brightest faces and seem interesting and even intermittently inspiring; they
might convince some people they actually stand for something.
I wouldn’t be surprised if political parties from elsewhere in the world are
watching this with eager attention.</p>

<title>Stéphane Dion</title>
<p>So the Liberals picked the pencil-neck geek with the bad hair, and his
acceptance speech wasn’t very good TV.   Still, he’s kind of appealing, he’s
real smart, and he knows how the system works.  That cynical old lizard
Chrétien gave a darn good speech, I thought.  Harper, Dion, Layton, Duceppe;
there are lots of countries whose citizens are looking at worse choices.</p>

<title>Web Application Security</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A pretty fierce debate has broken out on how to do security for
Web-applications (REST, WS-*, 
whatever).  I’m gratified that it seems to have started in the comments to
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/11/16/WS-Socratic">S for Simple</a>.
The proponents are
<a href="http://1raindrop.typepad.com/">Gunnar Peterson</a> and
<a href="http://wanderingbarque.com/nonintersecting/">Pete Lacey</a>, and what
they have to say is interesting.  I think Gunnar didn’t do a good enough job of
filling in one of the bases of his position, although in private email he sent
me a link to
<a href="http://www.ebankingsecurity.com/ebanking_bad_for_your_bank_balance.pdf">a
PDF from eBankingSecurity.com</a> which is worth a look.  The point is that a
significant proportion of Windows PCs are compromised with trojans and
keystroke-loggers and other flavors of bad-ware; significant enough that
the pretty-decent transport-level security provided by TLS is immaterial.
Those of us who are technically-competent and don’t use Windows
can feel individually secure, but that doesn’t mean Gunnar doesn’t have a point.</p>

<title>Wikipedia Churn</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There’s been something happening recently in my little corner of Wikipedia,
and I don’t know if it’s an anomaly or evidence of a trend; so this is raw
random anecdotal data.  By “my little corner” I mean the small collection
of articles that I track via a recent-changes Atom feed, have contributed to
quite a bit, and feel a little bit of shared responsibility for.  There’s been
a surge of recent editorial activity, with super-energetic (and
apparently well-informed) new contributors trimming and
tweaking and growing the articles, often several times per day.
In general, while I haven’t been convinced that 100% of the changes are
improvements, the quality of the articles as a whole is definitely trending
up.
Also, the random drive-by teenage defacements are getting fixed
<em>really</em> fast.
Anyone else seeing this?</p>

<title>Defining HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There’s a new thing in the world.  Since I got mixed up in the Web a dozen
years ago, there’ve always been groups of people trying to standardize HTML (at
the IETF, at the W3C, wherever) and as long as I can remember, they’ve been
genially ignored, mostly, by browser makers.
Maybe no longer; it seems that the
<a href="http://www.whatwg.org/">WHAT-WG</a> has broken through and been
noticed.
Mozilla engineer Rob Sayre 
<a href="http://www.imc.org/atom-syntax/mail-archive/msg19192.html">tells</a>
us that WHAT-WG is better than the previous contenders to the
HTML-standardization throne, 
that Firefox has already picked up one piece of their draft-ware, and will
be implementing more.
Meanwhile, Sam Ruby is
<a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2006/12/01/The-White-Pebble">doing
outstanding work</a>, apparently persuading the WHATters of the virtues keeping
what they’re calling “HTML5” somewhat compatible with the rest of the world’s
markup.</p>

<title>Microsoft XML, the Mac Angle</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There’s been a lot of noise these last few days about the Microsoft Office
XML file formats; the world doesn’t need my opinion again.  I’d vaguely noted
that Mac Office would be a little behind on the new XML, then
<a href="http://www.webmink.net/">Simon Phipps</a> shot me links to a couple
of closer looks, which shed an instructive light.</p>
<p>Andrew Shebanow
<a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/shebanation/2006/12/open_xml_one-way.html">does
some numbers</a> based on what we’re hearing and tries to estimate
how many person-years it would take to implement MSOXML; yow!</p>
<p>The impact is that for the next few months, Mac people, just like Linux and
Solaris people and everyone else who doesn’t use Windows, aren’t going to be
able to read Office’s native file format.  That’s OK, Sheridan Jones
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/macmojo/archive/2006/12/05/converters-coming-free-and-fairly-fast.aspx">suggests
a workaround</a>: “For now, we recommend that Mac users advise their friends
and colleagues using Office 2007 to save their documents as a
‘Word/Excel/PowerPoint 97-2003 Document’ (.doc, .xls, .ppt) to ensure the
documents can be shared across platforms.”  Right, then.</p>
<p>Students of message management will be amused at the conversation launched 
by 
<a href="http://www.schwieb.com/blog/">Erik Schwiebert</a> in
<a href="http://www.schwieb.com/blog/2006/12/05/conversion-factors/">Conversion
factors</a>.
He dives deep on the Mac Office file-format issues.  One fairly
astounding statement was “there are certainly a variety of XML parsers out
there, including libxml, but the only one that ships on Mac OS by default is
libxml and it doesn’t support everything that the new file formats need.”
Now that’s guaranteed to raise eyebrows in markup-land.
Predictably, the comments got a little heated, and it didn’t help when Erik
added “libxml didn’t handle the latest open standards that the XML spec
details”.   I’m trying hard to find a way to see that as anything other than a
blatant lie, but it’s tough.</p>
<p>Eventually Rick Schaut (who seems like a Real Smart Guy) pulled aside the
curtain of marketing weasel-speak and 
<a href="http://www.schwieb.com/blog/2006/12/05/conversion-factors/#comment-5270">laid out</a> the 
actual real engineering issues regarding libxml and MSXML and they’re not
surprising or nefarious; but you rarely see such a nakedly exposed linguistic
framing gradient.</p>
<p>I should close by saying that I’m a huge fan of the MacBU and think that 
Mac Office is probably the single best piece of software that Microsoft ships,
and that I’ll probably end up buying it.</p>

<title>On Bacon</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>You buy it shrink-wrapped in the supermarket, right?  And it’s not bad;
perhaps a slightly guilty pleasure and certainly best enjoyed in moderation.
But you know, that’s not real bacon; somehow, despite having grown up partly
on a farm, until a few weeks ago I’d never tasted the real thing.
On Main Street in Vancouver (which is not and has never been the main street)
at the corner of 20th Ave you’ll find Continental Sausage Co., which I guess
supplies restaurants and has an unpretentious little deli that we’ve started
patronizing.  The meats are in the German style and the ambiance
and pace are definitely of another era.  Anyhow, on impulse one Friday I ordered six
slices of bacon for Sunday breakfast, and she pulled out a big brown slab and
sliced them on the spot.  Oh my goodness gracious, it’s nothing at all
like what the supermarket has.  Now what I <em>do</em> remember from the farm
is fresh eggs, laid in the last day or so.  I wonder where I can find those in
Vancouver?</p>

<title>On Email</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>For years, I’ve had two email addresses; the current job and the long-term
personal one.  The latter is unfortunately one of the world’s most public,
appearing among other places on the front of the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/">XML specification</a>, and thus gets a
lot of spam.  I mean really a lot.  Which was causing some pretty severe pain,
but I’m using the Gmail dodge, and that helps quite a bit.</p>
<p>Mail client filtering these days is not too bad (except for the penny-stock
scum) but still, the volume (via POP3) was causing problems.  On the ISP side,
if I went offline
for a few days the mail spool would fill up and things would start bouncing.
And on my laptop, everything would get irritatingly sluggish when all the
spam was downloaded and filtered.  Particularly if I’d been offline for a
while, like say two hours.</p>
<p>I was thinking about changing ISPs and server-side filtering and IMAP and so on,
and feeling grumpy about the work, so instead I just redirected all my
personal email to my Gmail account (one tick-box at the ISP).   It works pretty well.</p>
<p>The Gmail spam
filter isn’t perfect but it’s not bad, and it all happens on some big data
farm out there that Google’s paying for; the amount of data that gets pushed
back and forth between my Mac and the Net has been slashed astoundingly, two
or three orders of magnitude, I bet, if I measured it.</p>
<p>Above my inbox is sometimes a little one-liner text ad (can’t complain,
somebody’s gotta be paying for this) and sometimes a little wee news snippet,
apparently driven by a random number
generator.
Hey Google, both the ads and news need some work, I’ve never felt the
slightest urge to click on either.</p>
<p>Also, it’s nice to have search that works; something about my mail backlog
persistently blows up Spotlight.</p>
<p>One nice thing about Gmail is the keyboard shortcuts; my only real gripe is
that there’s no shortcut for “delete”; I’m on all these nicely-archived
mailing lists, for the 90% or so of the messages that I don’t care about, I just
want to make ’em go away, why do I have to click on a button?  There’s a
GreaseMonkey plug-in for this, which <em>might</em> be enough to convert me
from Camino to Firefox.</p>
<p>Amusingly, in a few weeks of doing this, with not that much archived, and
letting Gmail erase the spam and trash after 30 days, I’m using 220MB, or, as
they say “(8%) of your 2792 MB”.  With that kind of volume, it’s astounding
that the Internet is holding together at all.  And, uh, 2792?  Anyone have an
explanation for that number?

<p>Actual real people I know doing actual real
work that pushes Java to the edge have been making happy noises about the
performance; to a degree greater than that graph would suggest.  It’s hard to
believe that after all these years that there’s much left to squeeze out of
the JVM; you have to be impressed.

<p>I’m no expert on this, but apparently the structure by which you can buy
support for Java apps has been re-built, for example see
<a href="http://www.sun.com/service/javamultiplatform/index.xml">Sun Spectrum
Java Multi Platform</a>.  People have been working terribly hard on this and
expect great things.</p>

<p>The JRuby releases come thick &amp; fast these days.
<a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JRUBY/2006/12/10">JRuby 0.9.2</a> is
another rung in the ladder; they’re closing in on

<title>Apple App Attrition</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Yes, it’s another anguished chapter in my relationship with OS X
and its posse.   Baubles already hanging on this chain include
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/16/Back-to-the-Mac">Back to the Mac</a>,
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/06/15/Switch-From-Mac">Time to Switch?</a>,
and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/03/29/Switch">Unswitch</a>.  Weirdly, unless
my logfiles are lying, people like reading them.  Anyhow, I had a
<em>hard</em> crash this afternoon when I unplugged my external screen, and
after OS X came back, both Mail.app and
<a href="http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=NetNewsWire">NetNewsWire</a> had lost their memory.
It turns out NetNewsWire takes a daily backup of your subscriptions (that
Brent Simmons, <em>he da man!</em>) so that only took a couple of minutes to
recover.
But Mail.app, like iCal, seems to think a crash is a good enough reason to
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/05/11/iCal-still-sucks">discard user data</a>; all
my preferences and profiles were gonzo, I had to start from scratch.  It still had my
old POP mail without the account they belonged to, but it’d forgotten about my
Sun IMAP world. 
I got it working again, but then there were some folders I didn’t recognize,
so I deleted them, and now it’s borked again; says “Synchronizing with server”
and never comes back.  So I said the hell with it and now I’m running 
Thunderbird, which ain’t as pretty but seems to work.  I’m still OK with OS X,
but the number of its apps I use is down to Address Book, iTunes, iMovie, and (until the
microsecond I find an alternative) iCal.  Apple makes nice computers and a
good operating system. Aside from movies or music, I’d stay away from the rest
of the apps.  OK, let’s try to be fair: I use computers and applications way
harder than most, and plenty of people are unlikely to push these apps into
breakage. 
And Apple’s mail and calendar and browser and so on are polished and easy to
use.
But I just can’t rely on them any longer.

engaged.  For evidence, check the

<title>5✭♫: Better Get Hit In Your Soul</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This piece appears on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mingus_Ah_Um">Mingus Ah Um</a>, a 1959
album by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Mingus">Charles Mingus</a>, and on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mingus_at_Antibes">Mingus at
Antibes</a>, recorded live the next year.
There may be a few rock-&amp;-roll fans who haven’t heard this and don’t know
how hard jazz can be played; I can’t imagine any band ever playing harder.
<i>(“5✭♫” series introduction <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music">here</a>;
with <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music#p-1">an
explanation</a> of why the title may look broken.)</i></p>
<img src="Mingus-playing.png" alt="Charles Mingus" class="inline"/>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Context</h2>
<p>Mingus (1922-79), spent much of his life at the top of
the jazz world.  He was prolific; there are many records and I only own a 
handful, but I look forward to exploring the rest.</p>
<p>The idiom is hard-bop, most of the playing fast, stepping out of
the bounds of traditional Western tonality as required, pushing hard at the
boundaries of what was then considered sanity in the arrangements and
ensemble. Some of it goes way out into what was later called “free-jazz”
territory, but Mingus had the wisdom to keep that short and then re-converge
with a bang, so for me, it mostly works, and I have trouble with most free
jazz.</p>
<p>It’s always a small ensemble, something like trumpet/sax/sax/bass/drums/piano.
There are big solos but a lot of the improvisation is collective, with the
players lashing each other higher and higher.  The debt to New Orleans parade
music and black-church gospel is obvious and was freely acknowledged by
Mingus.</p>
<p>He was an angry, sometimes nasty, sometimes violent, man.  Some of it was
political; it was reasonable for a talented black person born in the Twenties
to have spent most of his life angry.  But he went beyond that, sometimes
assaulting people on the stage and in the studio.
Late in life, he collaborated with Joni Mitchell, and on that record (which I
can’t seem to find at the moment) there’s a Mingus soliloquy entitled
<cite>Lucky Man</cite>; given his reputation, it’s oddly sunny and relaxed.
He talks about how life is really shitty for some people, but for himself, he
can’t complain too much; “I always had money to rub together in my pocket” he
explains.</p>
<img src="Mingus-Ah-Um.png" alt="Mingus Ah Um" />
<img src="Mingus-at-Antibes.jpg" alt="Mingus at Antibes" />
<h2 id='p-2'>The Music</h2>
<p>What happened was, sometime in the Seventies, I was in university majoring
in sex, drugs, rock&amp;roll, and left-wing politics, and I heard the
<cite>Antibes</cite> version of <cite>Better Get Hit In Your Soul</cite> very late
on one of those nights before the morning after and my eyes got big as
saucers, “There’s jazz that’s hotter
than Deep Purple?!?”  Well, not much, actually; but Mingus is at the center of
it.</p>
<p>I’ve come to like the studio version of <cite>Better Git Hit In Your
Soul</cite> on <cite>Mingus Ah Um</cite> too, it’s
got most of the energy but there’s more room between the notes, and they
have time to caress them a bit.  Also
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_Parlan">Horace Parlan</a>
provides nice light fast piano support.</p>
<p>But the <cite>Antibes</cite> take
discards all that subtlety crap and explores what happens when one
of the great jazz bands of all time puts the pedal right down to the metal and
holds it there for 11:34.  Another description would be “divine madness”.</p>
<p>Here’s what I wrote when I listened to it just now:
Bass intro, big loud brass call/response, a
chorus that sounds like schoolyard taunt, a sizzly sax plays alone, then the
band rolls in behind to make it faster and hotter, colourful explosions of atonality,
back to the fast sizzle, the rhythm section goes away and the band claps
behind the saxes, sizzle again, those atonal bits work because the music
is so hot that he just <em>had</em> to explode outside the form, now Mingus is
whooping and chortling into a little drum break, now the band vamps fast
behind
trumpet fireworks from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Curson">Ted Curson</a>, oops, there go the drums again, there’s
the vamp, 
there’s Ted, suddenly we’re listening to Charlie play big piano chords in
front of the drums.  Return to the opening call/response, but they’re shouting
now, and a wrap-up that Tchaikowsky would have been proud of.</p>
<p><cite>Antibes</cite> has two more of these hell-for-leather charges,
<cite>Wednesday Night 
Prayer Meeting</cite> and <cite>Folk Forms</cite>.
A couple of the tracks veer into boring self-indulgence though, the pit that free
jazz is always skating close to the edge of.</p>
<p>On balance, <cite>Ah Um</cite> is maybe the deeper recording, it has the
incandescent <cite>Goodbye Pork Pie Hat</cite>, the studied <cite>Fables of
Faubus</cite>, the slow funk of <cite>Pussy Cat Dues</cite>, the silky
trombone blues of <cite>Jelly Roll</cite>, and pretty well no wasted notes.</p>
<p>The sound quality on both records is pretty wonderful; it’s amazing what
you can accomplish by pointing high-quality electromechanical microphones at a
stage and capturing the output on high-quality magnetic tape.  None of that
digital crap, you know.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Sampling It</h2>
<p>That’d be silly.  Both <cite>Ah Um</cite> and <cite>Antibes</cite> are
superb records that will stretch your mind and have you boppin’.  So go
buy a shiny silver disc or two already.</p>

<title>Blogstitution</title>

<body>
<p>Someone named Vaspers asks 
<a href="http://vaspersthegrate.blogspot.com/2006/12/what-will-kill-blogosphere.html">What will kill the blogosphere?</a>
and thinks the answer is various forms of marketing-driven corruption lying in
the direction that
<a href="http://payperpost.com/">PayPerPost</a> is pointing.
<i>[Update: Good comments; pile on!]</i></p>
<p>He might have a point.  Assaf Arkin agrees, and declares Labnotes to be a
<a href="http://blog.labnotes.org/2006/12/13/blogstitution-free-zone/">Blogstitution-Free Zone</a>.
Among other things, he says “I will not blog favorably about a product/service
unless I’ll <b>go out of my way</b> to get it <b>with my own money</b>”.</p>
<p>Commercial pressure on blogs is absolutely
increasing; I now get story pitches most days from PR folk, in
varying degrees of cluefulness.  The lamest are something like
“In the SOA-driven Web 2.0 era, enterprises need the awesome power of
inferential data integration!  We have this vital story, straight from the
horse’s mouth!  And we can adapt it to your blog format for you!”</p>
<p>On the other hand, some are of the form “I’m a PR consultant working for
Frowlotron Information Injectors; they’ve got an XML database with a
high-performance Atom adaptor, seems like your kind of stuff, want to take a
look or talk to our guys?”  I
usually don’t, but I also don’t object to this kind of approach at all.</p>
<p>By a weird coincidence, I got one this afternoon:</p>
<blockquote><p> Hi, this is Amy from Buzztone. I enjoy reading your blog and I
was wondering if you would be interested in working together in a
promotion.</p> 
<p>Legendary artist, Yusuf, formerly Cat Stevens, is releasing his first new
album in 28 years this week titled "An Other Cup." I believe some editorial or
information about Yusuf’s album will be great for your site. I can provide you
with digital assets like photos, bio, news release and a CD for your
review.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At one level, kind of irritating about how their stuff will be “great for
my site”.  But the proposition seems straightforward.  I wrote back saying
“Sure, send me a CD and I might write about it and I might like it, I liked some
of Mr. Stevens’ stuff back in the day.”</p>
<p>Amy wrote back:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Tim,
That’s fine. I'll send you the Yusuf CD and you can see what you think. I
am also including a CD called Rytems Del Mundo which is a compilation of
music by big artist like Coldplay, Arctic Monkeys, and Sting remixed with an
Afro-Cuban sound. It was done by Ibrahim Ferrer and Omara Portuondo of Buena
Vista Social sound. Let me know how you like them and if you end up writing
about either of the albums.</p></blockquote>
<p>If she needs help finding out when a blogger’s writing about her
product, a lesson in Technorati 101 would be in order.  But still, seems fair enough.
And obviously,
<a href="/ongoing/What/Arts/Music/">I like writing about music</a>.</p>
<p>If I write about the music, pro or con, I’d need to disclose
that it was a freebie.  Professional music reviewers don’t, but that’s
fine because we assume they’re all freebies.
There’s the potential for corruption, I guess; I might be incented to write
glowing reviews of everything so that record companies send me free music.
I don’t think I’ll do that, but if I’m transparent enough, my readership is
intelligent enough to figure it out one way or another.</p>
<p>So is this just a pleasant perk of having a moderately-popular blog, or am
I stepping onto a slippery slope? </p>

<p>Heard about it via
<a href="http://blog.rapidred.com/articles/2006/12/14/changing-the-present">Bruce
Tate</a> who’s apparently building it, and at first glance I’m very
<em>very</em> impressed. 
<a href="http://changingthepresent.org/">ChangingThePresent</a> is trying to
bring web-commerce techniques to philanthropy, and off the top I can’t see why
it won’t work.  When it’s this easy to pick a cause, pick a vehicle, and throw
a few bucks into the pot, why wouldn’t you do so every time you read a
particularly grim headline or see a particularly horrifying picture?
And lord knows there are enough lame presents exchanged this time of year.
If they succeed in getting a feedback-heavy community built up around this, it
could really be a new thing in the world.
The jury’s out, obviously; but I’ll be watching.</p>

<title>On Email Clients</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>As I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/12/11/Mac-Crash">wrote recently</a>, Mac
Mail 
lost some of its memory in a crash and, when I restored things, stopped
working.  I was keeping it running so I could go search for things, and then
one day I accidentally clicked “Get new mail” and it did, so I guess it’d
worked through its issues, whatever they were.  Now that all my non-IMAP mail
is
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/12/10/EMail">on GMail</a>, I can switch
clients back and forth a bit; so herewith, comparative remarks on GMail,
Thunderbird, and Mail.app.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Thunderbird 1.5</h2>
<p>Get it
<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/thunderbird/">here</a>.
It’s probably the least feature-ful of the three alternatives, but it feels
solid, and given the number of heavy geeks who are now using it, I’m confident
that it’ll go on being maintained and enhanced more or less forever.</p>
<p>It’s got one really nice feature that none of the others have; space-bar
takes you through the message text and when you get to the end, offers to take
you to the next unread message in whatever mailbox.</p>
<p>For a Mac user, it’s irritating that it doesn’t integrate with the system
address-book and misses some other Mac niceties like the emacs keystrokes.  
In fact, I couldn’t find any way at all to customize the key-mappings.  This
is really irritating on a big keyboard, because the DEL key doesn’t delete a
message; you have to use the Backspace key (the one that’s labeled “delete” on
laptop keyboards).</p>
<p>Weirdly, it doesn’t let you keep a bunch of different signatures around and
slap one one to a message.</p>
<p>But the biggest Thunderbird gripe is that it’s really kind of slow;
fetching mail, sending 
mail, and just moving from message to message.</p>
<p>I suspect that in the long run, Thunderbird is where I’m most likely to end
up, just because I don’t think any commercial vendor is going to be able to
keep up with the Mozilla tribe in terms of fixing bugs and adding new
stuff.</p>
<p>Also, there’s already an active community building add-ons and plug-ins;
that’s a real plus.
Given that, the announced feature list for Thunderbird 2.0 is fairly unexciting.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Mail.app</h2>
<p>This is the mail program that comes with the Mac.  It’s quite a bit
snappier than Thunderbird and  well-integrated with the rest of the system.
It’s got the nice control-N/P/F/B/E/A keystrokes from Emacs, which are a real
time-saver when you’re composing messages.</p>
<p>It’s a whole lot prettier to look at than Thunderbird, and in the long
term, that matters.</p>
<p>For many people, it offers first-class search via
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spotlight/">Spotlight</a>, which
for some reason that just silently fails to work for me, so I have to run
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/04/21/Routing-Around-Spotlight">slow shell
scripts</a> to search message content.</p>
<p>And that’s the biggest problem; the whole thing feels a little shaky; it
crashes a little too often, locks up a little too often, and as I found, is
apt to lose your profile information in a system crash.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>GMail</h2>
<p>GMail is a bunch of different new and mostly good ideas
thrown together in a package.
Obviously, it provides better search than Thunderbird and is probably
competitive with Spotlight.</p>
<p>The single best idea is Archive/Labeling.  On most mail systems, when I’m done
thinking about a message and want to file it away, I have to decide which
mailbox to put it in.  This is really conflating two unrelated things: getting
it out of the inbox and deciding what it’s about.  With GMail’s archive, I can
just nuke it from the inbox but still have it available by search, without
having to decide what it’s about.  How many of us have email folders named
“misc” or “odds-n-sods”?  Also, you can apply more than one label (I haven’t
done this yet, but that may just be years of file-folder conditioning).</p>
<p>I have one minor gripe: there’s no keyboard shortcut for Delete; I’ve
already complained about this.  An authority on the subject remarked off-line:
“They don’t want you to do that.”  And of course Google’s all about search.
But trust me, there are a zillion emails come in over the threshold that I
just don’t wanna see again ever.</p>
<p>My major gripe is GMail’s notion of “conversations”, which is a threaded
view of email taken to an extreme.
I find that it makes GMail completely unusable for high-volume discussion
lists; I can’t stand having long threads squished into a single line.  I
decide whether a thread is interesting based in part on who’s posting to it,
and GMail hides that.  So I’m transferring all my mailing-list memberships
back to my Sun IMAP account.</p>
<p>If that single issue were cleared up (maybe there’s a way to get GMail to
un-thread its threads, but I can’t find it) I could see GMail (or Yahoo’s
version or whatever) becoming a perfectly viable full-time mail-reader.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Spam</h2>
<p>None of these are distinctly better than the others at spam.  GMail’s a
little better at stopping the penny-stock promotions, but shows me quite a few
you-won-the-lottery notices, and even some of the classic
Nigerian-bank-transfer offers.</p>

<title>Framing Lauren</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Check out
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/archives/2006/12/16/framed/">Framed!</a>
by Lauren Wood.  There’s puzzling low-grade Internet scamware afoot.
Here’s a slightly more detailed description of what’s going on; if you have
any ideas, please leave a comment on her blog, not here.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of URLs, <code>aff00001.com</code> through
<code>aff000028.com</code>; each of them can produce three distinct
results.  If you fetch it with <code>curl</code> (a command-line URL fetcher
on Unix-like systems) you get a page with a title and meta-tag claiming it to
be “Adult Friend 
Finder”, and whose body is a list, sans markup, of 10,000 misspellings of the
URL for <code>adultfriendfinder.com</code>.  This is apparently what the
google robot sees, so if you google for (selecting one misspelling randomly)
<code>adultfriendfindor.cwm</code>, you get this page which looks like a link
to Adult Friend Finder.  And if you click on that link, dereferencing aff000022.com
from the Google results list, sure enough, you get redirected and land on
Adult Friend Finder in all its sleazy glory.  What's weird though, is that if
you go to aff000022.com by typing the URL into your browser, or by linking
from another page that isn't a google result page, you get a little
<code>&lt;frame></code> package that pulls in 
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">www.laurenwood.org/anyway</a>,
leaving no trace of its existence.</p>
<p>The 29th page has only about 7,000 misspellings, so they are capturing
about 277,000 potential mis-spelled URLs.</p>
<p>Like Lauren, I’m puzzled.  Ideas?</p>
<p><i>[Update: 
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/archives/2006/12/19/post-results/">They’re

<title>Incoming</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>My computer, like most, is normally connected to the Internet, and since
I’m on quite a few mailing lists and subscribe to quite a few feeds, I get a
lot of traffic.  In general, we really haven’t figured out how to
manage traffic in such a way that we know what’s going on and still get 
work done.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, I noticed that as I got more deeply connected at
Sun, my email traffic was getting more interesting, and on a couple
of days I cleaned up my interesting email and my high-value RSS feeds and
(maybe with an intervening telecon or two) realized it was 2PM.  I suppose
there are those whose job is all about communication for whom this would be
sensible, but I need to do some writing and some coding too.</p>
<p>My first cut was to hide the Dock, so I couldn’t see the visual indicator
that there was mail available.  That’s OK, but I’m reaching for it often
enough that I still see the little unread-count numbers.</p>
<p>Next, I brought back the Dock but turned off polling for both mail and
news-feeds.  That was quite a bit better, and I was more frequently able to
drop into 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow state</a> and
get some output happening.</p>
<p>It wasn’t perfect, though.  Given my mail volume, the email tends
to lock
up for an irritatingly long time when I turn IMAP back on.  And when I decided to plow
through my incoming feeds, sometimes an urgent email would go ignored for
half-an-hour; irritating since feed-reading is by definition
interruptible.</p>
<p>Also, sometimes my flow state would get interrupted by a chat message.  I
could turn off chat when trying to concentrate, that’s kind of tedious.</p>
<p>So now I’m relying mostly on 
<a href="http://growl.info/">Growl</a>, and a bit of self-discipline.
I assume there is the equivalent of Growl on Windows &amp; GNU/Linux?  If so,
drop me a line or a comment and I’ll update here.
Growl is this wonderful thingie that aggregates notifications from any other
program that might want to notify you about anything, and notifies you in a
way that’s quite programmable. 
Often you’ll need a little add-in or extra to make an app talk to Growl, but
they all seem to have ’em.  In my case, I have Mail.app, Thunderbird, Adium,
and Google Notifier (for GMail) talking to Growl.</p>
<p>I use the “Music Video” notification style by
<a href="http://www.salvadorcaffarena.com/">Jose Salvador Caffarena</a>;
thanks Jose!
This slides a transparent band up across the bottom of your screen with the
gist of the notification, holds it there for a selectable amount of time (I
use four seconds), and then slides it back down.  I think it looks great, but
for those who disagree,
Growl has lots of other flavors.</p>
<p>So, what I do is, when I’m reading (mail, feeds, interruptible stuff) I
turn Growl on and I hear about anything that happens right then as it happens.
When I want to buckle down and work on something I turn it off, and nothing
interrupts me.</p>
<p>Finally, I hid the Dock again, so I don’t get the little red numbers
telling me about the unread inputs.  I mentioned self-discipline?  By force of
will, I’m ignoring the red numbers when I reach for the Dock for something.
Do-able, with a little effort.</p>

<p>The tree doctor came by this morning and gave us the bad news; the wounds
were fatal.
So the plum tree, the one
<a href="http://maryamie.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!9592F3DEF41537A3!2509.entry">Maryam said</a> grew the best
plums she’d ever eaten, pictured
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/03/28/Treeflowers">here</a> and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/07/15/Summer">here</a>, will be firewood
early next year.</p>
<p>It was old and always grew at an angle.  But then the winter of 2006-07 happened.
Hah, “2006-07”, we haven’t seen ’07 yet and 
even if this winter ended today, it would have featured more crappy weather in
one sequence than I’ve seen since I moved here in 1983.
Anyhow, the heavy snow was too much for the leaning tree.</p>
<p>One of the problems was high wind.</p>
<img src="IMGP4353.jpg" alt="Fallen tree in Vancouver, December 2006" />
<p>That’s a couple of blocks from our place, and if the wind had been coming
from the other way, or the tree been on the other side of the street, someone
would be looking at rebuilding their house, assuming they were alive.</p>
<p>Please, rest of winter, be easy on us.</p>

<title>3✭♫: An Other Cup</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is a recent release by Yusuf, born Steven Demetre Georgiou, known in
a previous life as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_Stevens">Cat
Stevens</a>, and whose legal name is Yusuf Islam.
It has very beautiful sound and some fine singing, but only a few
of the tunes are keepers.  There are religious issues.
<i>(I’ve been running a “5✭♫” series, introduction <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music">here</a>,
with <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music#p-1">an
explanation</a> of why the title may look broken; I’m borrowing the format for
this piece.)</i></p>
<p><em>[Disclosure: I didn’t buy this; the PR agency
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/12/13/Blog-PR">emailed me out
of the blue</a> and I wrote back “OK, send me the disc.”]</em></p>
<p>The single name “Yusuf” is appealing, and also not having “Islam” on the
cover of the disc means any of your fans with one in their luggage are less
apt to get hauled into the back room by Homeland Security.</p>
<img src="Yusuf.png" class="inline" alt="Yusuf AKA Yusuf Islam AKA Cat Stevens AKA Steven Georgiou" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Voice</h2>
<p>So, the first question is “Can he still sing?” and the answer is “At least half the time.”
There are two distinct voices here.  The first is Cat Stevens’ and appears on
the songs that are up-tempo and when he uses his upper registers; it sounds
pretty damn wonderful, like that voice used to in the Seventies.</p>
<p>A few of the songs are in another voice entirely; lower, slower,
close-miked, and much less pleasing to my ears; but tastes vary.</p>
<p>Let’s do the good stuff first.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Sound</h2>
<p>“Produced by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Nowels">Rick Nowels</a> and Yusuf”
say the liner notes, and I don’t know much
about Rick, but I have to say it sounds excellent, end to end.  The
instruments are assertive in some places and mellow in others, as appropriate, and
get out of the way of Yusuf’s voice, which after all is the featured instrument.</p>
<p>A couple of the tracks are audiophile-demo grade.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>God</h2>
<p>Well, the deity kind of gets in the way. 
If you listen to the words, his faith is quietly in your face the whole time.
And a substantial part of it is that ole
time religion, as in Muhammad is the messenger of God, good people win and
then go to heaven and the rest to hell, so there.
</p>
<p>I have nothing in particular against Muslim theology, at least it’s purely
monotheist without any rococo Trinity or Mother-of-God ornamentation.  But I
don’t believe in their God any more than anyone else’s, so I wish he’d find
things to sing about that actually touched my heart.
On the other hand, if I gave up enjoying music by believers, that would cost
me Bach, Coltrane, and U2, so I won’t.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Music</h2>
<p>There are eleven songs here, two of which are short flowery poems (one by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumi">Rumi</a>) with tinkly-sweet
instrumentals behind Yusuf’s velvety
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_Pronunciation">Received
Pronunciation</a>.</p>
<p>Of the remaining nine, a handful are really quite good.
I already said the sound is excellent; the arrangements are too, sometimes,
with a tendency to veer into anodyne string arrangements.</p>
<p><cite>Heaven/Where True Love Goes</cite> is is the one you might hear on
the radio; the “Heaven must’ve programmed 
you” half is kind of turgid, but the “I go where true love goes” chorus is awfully
pretty, featuring that voice you might remember if you’re old enough.</p>
<p>I mentioned the new un-Cat voice; it’s featured on <cite>One Day At a
Time</cite>; almost weirdly slow, Yusuf’s low, close-miked voice occasionally
has trouble holding pitch.  Some will like it I suppose, but I don’t.</p>
<p><cite>In The End</cite> has some swing and fun to it, and is 
well-sung.   I’ve decided that I won’t let it bother me that it says
I’m going to hell because I’m “deceived”, and I don’t believe that the
good guys necessarily win, either. But you have to like that lyric “You can’t
bargain with the truth...”; and the arrangement and playing are really
fine.</p>
<p><cite>I think I See the Light</cite> is another decent song; fast, sung in
that nice higher register, with an interesting honky-tonk feel, and some real
drama in the arrangement.</p>
<p>One of the songs is not written by Yusuf.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood</h2>
<p>Yep,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Let_Me_Be_Misunderstood">that
song</a>, first sung by Nina Simone in 1964, subsequently by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Animals">The Animals</a>, and while
I’m one of the eleven people that never saw <cite>Kill Bill</cite>, I bought the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Esmeralda">Santa Esmeralda</a>
Seventies disco version in the Seventies, because it was good.</p>
<p>I can’t make up my mind about this one.  First of all, it’s an audio
showpiece.  The arrangement, playing, and production are outstanding; if you
have a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/03/02/Totem">good subwoofer</a>, it’ll come
in handy.
I think he takes it way too slow, and while I still think Yusuf sings better
high and fast rather than slow and low, this is the one that comes closest to
selling me on the deep close-miked stuff.</p>
<p>And you really can’t avoid the question of why this song is on this
record. Could it, just maybe, be about that nasty
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_Stevens#Salman_Rushdie_controversy">Salman
Rushdie and the <i>fatwa</i></a> affair?
Sorry, Yusuf, I have an attitude problem here.  On that issue, you either told
the Khomeini-ites to fuck off or you’re part of the problem, and you were part of
the problem.  Gosh, says
<a href="http://www.iranfocus.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=5768">here</a>
that the <i>fatwa</i> still stands.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if I gave up enjoying music by sinners, that would cost
me even more than discarding the believers; and at least this
<i>apologia</i> sounds very good.</p>
<h2 id='p-10'>Rushdie Sidebar</h2>
<p>Did anyone actually <em>read</em>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Satanic_Verses">The Satanic Verses</a>?
I did, but I’m pretty sure the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardianship_of_the_jurists_%28doctrine%29">Velayat
Faqih</a> dimwits behind the <i>fatwa</i> didn’t; nor did most of the journalists
who nonetheless managed to write authoritative-sounding stories.
That’s because it’s thick and difficult and complex.  Also, in my opinion,
not that good.  And I’m a fan; I think Rushdie’s
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight's_Children">Midnight’s
Children</a> is a masterpiece.</p>
<p>Whatever; in the <cite>Verses</cite>, the episodes that feature
(disrespectfully) a
Muhammad-like figure appear as part of the fantasies of a deranged
protagonist, subsequently a murderer.  Which you’d think would kind of be a
mitigating circumstance;  but I guess the ayatollah’s fanboys were
about form not content.</p>
<h2 id='p-8'>Bad Stuff</h2>
<p>There are a couple of really disposable songs on here; the opening
<cite>Midday (Avoid City After Dark)</cite> which takes four boring minutes or
so to say nothing more than the title, and <cite>Greenfields, Golden
Sands</cite>, appalling schmaltz with gooey string arrangements to
match.</p>
<h2 id='p-9'>What To Do?</h2>
<p>I probably wouldn’t buy the CD with my own money.  If there were a way to buy
DRM-free uncompressed copies of <cite>In The End</cite>, <cite>I Think I See
the Light</cite>, and I guess <cite>Misunderstood</cite>, I might go for those,
though. 
Yusuf needs to find a way to get hungry and energized and focus on
the music, not God.</p>

who can resist a chance to blather on about themselves?
So, here are five not-widely-known things.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I’m the holder of a Guinness World Record, along with the 6,451 other
British Columbia music students and teachers who gathered on May 15, 2000, to
constitute the world’s largest (very 
temporary) orchestra.  We played

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._9_%28Beethoven%29#Fourth_movement">Ode

hundred of us, so we were completely swamped by the thousands of trumpets and
trombones from all the marching bands.
It was completely putrid, musically speaking.</p></li>
<li><p>I met my wife 
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway">Lauren Wood</a>
for the first time at  
<a href="http://www.montreux-palace.com/">Le Montreux Palace</a>, the grand
old hotel where

lived while he wrote
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_or_Ardor:_A_Family_Chronicle">Ada</a>,
one of my favorite novels.</p></li>
<li><p>I don’t suffer particularly from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affective_lability">lability</a>, but
the opening ceremonies of the Olympic games always make me weep.  Even
thinking about them has that effect.  Go figure.</p></li>
<li><p>If you ask me, the most beautiful human to have ever lived is

as she appeared in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Year_of_Living_Dangerously">The Year

<li><p>At Sun, we have role called a “Distinguished Engineer”.  I don’t really
know very much about what that means, but as of last week, I’m one of them.
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Now if this were presented as a Chain Letter I’d stop the chain, but it’s
just “tagging”, and everybody knows I’m all about tags.  Hmm... like too many
online things, this has been a boys’ club, so let’s aim the pointy end
of the angle bracket at some non-boys:

<title>The iPod shuffle</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’d never owned an iPod, but recently picked up one of the
new shuffles (the lower-case version of the name seems to be official).  It’s
an awfully appealing little product.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Why?</h2>
<p>When I want to listen to music, either I’m at home, where I have
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/03/02/Totem">lots of good technology</a>, or
I’m on the road, where I have my laptop.  So I never felt the need for
an iPod.</p>
<p>The shuffle pushed me over the edge; it’s cheap enough that the cost seems
minor compared to the irritation factor of wrestling the PowerBook into play in 
airport lounges and economy-class seat configurations.  And I almost always
listen in shuffle mode anyhow.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Shopping</h2>
<p>Apple’s got the online buying experience down cold; you can get in, order
your shuffle, specify the no-extra-cost inscription you want on it, and get
out in just a couple of minutes, and mine showed up inside of a week, during
the Christmas rush at that.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Experience</h2>
<p>I listen to it through my
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/06/23/BDayGoodies">Shure 3C’s</a> and while
the sound won’t make the audiophile heart swell with love, it won’t turn
the audiophile stomach either.
Compared to other portable devices I’ve tried, the volume range seems just
right; I don’t know how loud it goes but I’ve played it louder than is perhaps
100% safe on a couple of Iggy Pop tunes, and I think it had more to give.</p>
<p>The “clip” form factor works really well, no matter what you’re wearing
there’s a convenient place to hang a shuffle.</p>
<p>The capacity is 1G which at 128K is like 16 hours of music, which means
that for almost any conceivable business trip, you could just load it up once.
The iTunes fill-it-with-a-shuffle interface works fine, although the USB
interface is no speed demon.</p>
<p>One irritant: I’ve got an aftermarket USB charger, and I haven’t figured
out whether it works with this yet.  When I plug it in, the shuffle shows, not
the solid orange “I’m charging” light, but the flashing version which means “Please plug me into a box with iTunes so I
can check for updates and make sure you’re not doing anything illegal, you
naughty man.”  I really must leave it plugged in for a few hours sometime to
see if it’s actually charging.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Improving the Controls</h2>
<p>On one side of the shuffle there are tiny switches for on/off and
shuffle/sequential.  The front has the famous iPod circular control.  The
middle is stop/start, then the four quadrants are volume up/down and skip
forward/back.  Nothing simpler could be imagined.</p>
<img src="shuffle.png" alt="iPod shuffle" class="inline" />
<p>But there’s one obvious problem.  Depending on what
you’re wearing, there’s a lot of different orientations it could end up at.
Look at the little picture I just now snipped out of the
<a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/">Apple.com shuffle page</a>; for
this person, louder is left, quieter is right, skip forward is up and skip
backward is down.  Particularly if you’re wearing your shuffle under your coat
(like everyone in Canada at the moment), it’s not obvious how you get
your finger on the right button.  This can be a problem when the dying strains
of the Schubert quartet give way to the White Stripes, and you need to crank it
down PDQ before you get brain damage.</p>
<p>The solution is also obvious; one of the quadrants of the circle needs a
little bump on it like keyboards have on “F” and “J” to help touch-typists.
If you had a bump, for example on the “+”, your fingers would quickly learn
how to get oriented, whatever weird angle the shuffle is at.</p>
<p>I’m open to negotiating with Apple for the rights to deploy this bold
innovation; they’re <em>all about</em> respect for
intellectual property, aren’t they?</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Not a Pod Person</h2>
<p>I don’t want to walk around the city with wires hanging from my
ears; I don’t need or want a cushion of music between me and urban reality.
But when I was figuring out how the shuffle worked, I plugged it in one time
before I left the office for my 12-minute walking commute home.
The shuffle ramped up <cite>Solvejg’s Song</cite> by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edvard_Grieg">Grieg</a> just as I
stepped into the dim afternoon onto the wet grey sidewalk, a crew with
machines breaking concrete unheard, and suddenly reality felt like a
Tarkovsky set-piece.</p>
<p>I can see why people do this, sometimes.  But I don’t think I will much.</p>

<title>JSON and XML</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I hear people saying “JSON is great, XML is over”, but I don’t hear
XML partisans saying anything bad about JSON.
There are two arguments that <em>are</em> over, though.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the great thing about JSON is that it exists for one
purpose: to put structs on the wire.  With XML, on
the other hand, it’s 
assumed that you might want to stream it in by the gigabyte, or load it into
one of a many different in-memory data structures, or run a full-text indexer
over the contents, or render it for human consumption, or, well, anything.</p>
<p>Given JSON’s single-purpose design, generating and parsing it ought to be
faster than with XML; but on the other hand, there aren’t that many apps where
parsing and unparsing are a significant part of the workload.</p>
<p>XML’s internationalization is more thorough; it requires you to
think about how you’re encoding the characters, and lets you use ISO-8859 or
JIS or whatever if that’s your world.
Also, while it’s not in the spec, every XML parser I’ve seen says “I’ll figure
out the encoding in the incoming doc, and take care of it, and <em>all you’ll
ever see is UTF-X</em>”, where “X” is 16 for Java and C#, 8 for almost
everything else.
I look at the Ruby JSON library, for example, and I see all these character
encoding conversion routines; blecch.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Use JSON</h2>
<p>Seems easy to me; if you want to serialize a data structure that’s not too
text-heavy and all you want is for the receiver to get the same data structure
with minimal effort, and you trust the other end to get the
i18n right, JSON is hunky-dory.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Use XML</h2>
<p>If you want to provide general-purpose data that the receiver might want to
do unforeseen weird and crazy things with, or if you want to be really
paranoid and picky about i18n, or if what you’re sending is more like a
document than a struct, or if the order of the data matters, or if the data is
potentially long-lived (as in, more than seconds) XML is the way to go.</p>
<p>It also seems to me that the combination of XML and XPath hits a sweet spot
for data formats that need to be <em>extensible</em>; that is to say, it’s
pretty easy to write XML-processing code that won’t fail in the presence of
changes to the message format that don’t touch the piece you care about.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>The Arguments Are Over</h2>
<p>There used to be an argument about whether platform-neutral,
language-neutral data formats were important, or whether distributed objects
were the right answer.  That’s over:  HTML, XML, JSON.</p>
<p>There used to be people who argued that network interchange formats shouldn’t
be text-based, but use binary where possible, for efficiency.  That’s over: HTML,
XML, JSON.</p>

<p>That would be the
<a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Atom_Publishing_Protocol_Draft_12">twelfth draft</a> of the Atom 
Publishing Protocol spec.  We’ll be asking for IETF last call on this draft.
I’m pretty sure that the final product will look
about like this.  I wouldn’t be surprised if the IETF process patched a couple
of security oversights or uncovered a couple of corner cases; nor would I be
surprised if it didn’t.  But I think that implementors who run with this will
be pretty safe; mind you, there are a lot out there who didn’t wait this long;
and they deserve our thanks.  As do the editors and the good people in the
<a href="http://ietf.org/html.charters/atompub-charter.html">Working
Group</a>; this has been mostly a pretty good trip.

Dave Johnson links to
<a href="http://rollerweblogger.org/roller/entry/latest_links10">several

<title>Christmas Pictures</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Another Christmas in the bosom of the family; we got all of
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/08/11/MomsGarden">Jean Bray’s</a> children,
their spouses, and her grandchildren together, which we don’t manage often
enough, in Calgary.
Like many others, I find with every year that passes that the people
seem more important, the eating and drinking and so on less; but I got an
outstanding present.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Turkey</h2>
<p>Let’s not diss the eating and drinking; my brother
<a href="http://takingalongview.blogspot.com/">Rob Bray</a> produced this
superb turkey. He explained that getting the dark meat done just right without
drying out the light meat is really hard; his solution involves wrapping the
bird in foil and using a higher heat.
We also experienced the infamous <a href="http://takingalongview.blogspot.com/2005/10/nuclear-garlic-paste.html">nuclear
garlic paste</a>, which is best enjoyed in moderation.</p>
<img src="IMGP4403.jpg" alt="Rob Bray’s Christmas turkey" />
<h2 id='p-2'>Camera Progress: Flash</h2>
<p>That picture is unusual, in that I took it with the camera’s flash but it 
looks OK.  I’ve never come close to mastering flash.</p>
<p>One afternoon my brother
<a href="http://www.pierdesign.ca/">Don Bray</a>, a fine photographer, pulled
out his camera to take a shot of our baby; he shoots with a Pentax DSLR too
and was holding a plain piece of white paper in front of the flash.  The
picture was great and I turned green with envy.
He gave me a little seminar and I tried it and it works!
He pointed me at 
<a href="http://abetterbouncecard.com/">ABetterBounceCard.com</a>, check it
out.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Camera Progress: Manual</h2>
<p>I got three items from my Amazon wish-list; none of
them were bought at Amazon and one was <cite>Understanding Exposure</cite> by
Bryan Peterson.  His Web site gets no linkage because it doesn’t seem to work for me
in either Camino or Safari, but I heartily recommend the book.</p>
<p>It gave me the courage to run the camera in fully-manual mode, which turns out
to be easier than you’d think.  Having said that, I’ll probably stick to
Pentax’s “SuperProgram” mode, which lets you switch back and forth between
aperture and shutter priority instantly.  Below, full manual.</p>
<img src="IMGP4387.jpg" alt="Sunlit winter trees in Calgary" />
<div class="caption"><p>Evergreens behind winter-bare birch behind something
with red berries.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-4'>Camera Progress: RAW</h2>
<p>Back when I got the Pentax, I considered shooting RAW vs. JPEG and ended up
with JPEG because I couldn’t see the difference, and downloading the huge RAW
files was a pain, and because the tools for loading the RAWs were shaky.</p>
<p>Brother Don to the rescue, once again.  One of his Christmas presents was a
fast card reader.  I’d never seen the point, always plugging my camera into
the computer, but I hadn’t realized how fast these puppies can be, gulping
cards-full of big RAW shots in seconds.</p>
<p>Finally, he showed me
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/cameraraw.html">Adobe Camera
Raw</a>, a Photoshop plug-in that works fine with Elements and has no trouble
with the Pentax’s .NEF files.  When I saw him fine-tuning the White Balance, I
was hooked.</p>
<p>With the combination of the new flash technique and the RAW wrangling, I
got a bunch of pleasing Christmas pictures, but they mostly feature the
children whom we don’t publish here.  But I cropped the audience out of a
picture of Mom reading a bedtime story.</p>
<img src="IMGP4423.jpg" alt="Jean Bray reading Grimm’s Fairy Tales" />
<p>Yeah, there’s not too much to it.  But it’s the first time I’ve taken a
flash picture of a human being that didn’t make me puke and resort to heavy
remedial Photoshopping.</p>
<p>I hope you and yours had a Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year to all!</p>

<title>Children</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>What with Christmas and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/06/11/Now-We-Are-Four">a baby in the
family</a>, there’ve been a lot of children on my mind.
To a child, this is an axiom:  <em>The amount of love is
constant, but the amount of candy is variable</em>.
It explains a lot.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Atwood">Margaret Atwood</a>, as
a young woman, wrote a short story about children making
poison, and underlined its conclusion (just as important as mine about candy,
but I won’t summarize, go read it, <cite>Making Poison</cite>) by saying “...
and if you don’t 
understand that, you’ll never understand anything.”  I’ve never had the
courage to write anything that strong (and I wonder if, a few decades older,
she’d be able to), but I feel that way about lots of things, mostly
computing-related.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Baby</h2>
<p>In retrospect I found the boy’s first years kind of
boring, up until he was four or so and I could actually talk to him.  Either a
lot of the good stuff was lost in the general parent-of-young-baby memory
washout, or the
little girl is more fun, or maybe I’m just less anxious and more receptive.
She’s got a thousand-watt smile and is so delighted 
at learning things: how to grab one of my fingers with each of her hands so I
can pull her up; how to enjoy peek-a-boo; how to <em>play</em> peek-a-boo,
holding a towel up in front of her face (this is still pretty approximate).</p>
<p>I had the fun, with each kid, of helping them learn how to eat solids; the
boy had a visible “A-ha!” moment while I was holding the spoon: “This gooey stuff
on the piece of metal they’re sticking in my mouth is food, I swallow it and
it goes in my stomach!”  She picked it up slower but is hearty eater.  This is
serious business; the smile is stowed away and her mouth snaps open
for the spoon like a piece of small delicate machinery.</p>
<p>By the way, here’s something to try someday; feed a little baby something
with your fingers.  I did this with some white rice the other day, since there wasn’t a
small spoon handy.  The tiny lips, no teeth behind them, are amazingly warm and
soft and alive; it occurs to me that this is what it feels like to be a sea
anemone’s meal.</p>
<p>I could write at length on the way she differs from my memory of her
brother, and for added fun, could turn each observation into a generality
explaining what little boys are like and what little girls are like; after
all, I observe 100% correlation between their behavioral differences and their
gender.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Boy</h2>
<p>Now seven, he’s blossoming into a real member of the family.  We’ve been
traveling a lot, heavily laden, over the year-end; Lauren and I each push a
luggage cart and he pushes the baby stroller, maybe a little too exuberantly,
but how much trouble can he get into going slightly too fast down an airport
hallway?</p>
<p>He’s rambunctious and theatrical (more so than either Lauren and I ever
remember being) and irritatingly over-the-top about the silliest everyday
things; but you wouldn’t want a kid to be a carbon copy of yourself, would you?</p>
<p>At my brother’s place, the four of us all slept in a big basement room, him
on a sofa. 
In the middle of the night Lauren woke me up and said “mumble mumble boy” so I
went over there and a little voice came out of the darkness “I think I’m on
the floor”.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Being Avuncular</h2>
<p>You can read about Rob’s kids 
<a href="http://takingalongview.blogspot.com/">here</a>; it turns out that 
the child he doesn’t write about much is a budding thirteen-year-old girl
geek, in transition from Neo-Pets to DeviantArt.  She’s scary-bright, pulls
ultra-high marks with little effort.  Says she wants to grow up
and be a computer programmer so she can write games like Furcadia, and Lord
knows our profession could use some smart young women.</p>
<p>So I started talking to her about HTML and CSS, and she’s got the idea that
when you see a website you like, you can “View Source” and figure it out.
Which, given the places she hangs out, had led her to use tables for
everything.</p>
<p>So I showed her the CSS Zen Garden and explained <code>#id</code> and
<code>.class</code> selectors and she spent the next couple of days glued to
the computer; she said 
“I’m aligning things”.</p>
<p>Turns out she’s got a drop-dead cool online handle and I looked and the
domain names were free so I got her the <code>.net</code> and
<code>.ca</code>.
While I’ve given my share of advice over the years, I’ve never had this
sort of <i>sensei</i> feeling, and I like it.  If she sticks with it, it’ll be
fun to help her with advice and computers and jobs.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Twenty-First Century Family Fun</h2>
<p>We were hanging around talking about James Brown having died, Rob with our
baby on his lap and a laptop propped on the arm of the sofa, and he said
“Kids, look at <em>this</em>”, pulling up some of JB’s video.   They liked it.
So we all had
fun picking extreme old videos to expand the kids’ minds; they saw <cite>We Ain’t
Gonna Take It</cite> and the Aerosmith/DMC <cite>Walk This
Way</cite>, and a few others, while we snickered and talked politics in the
background.  Hope we haven’t bent their minds.</p>

<p>My writing energy here in Australia is about fully occupied by a writing

<p>We took the kids to Melbourne Zoo, which is OK if in parts too
old-fashioned (but the Australian-animals section is fine).  I find zoo
animals kind of depressing so I usually don’t take pictures.  But there was an
attractive red-headed black duck swimming in murky water with its baby
chicks—a volunteer I think, not a zoo animal—and they were too cute to resist.</p>
<img src="CRW_5172.jpg" alt="Waterfowl, mother and baby" />
<p>Are zoos ethical?  I think on balance yes, my revulsion is aesthetic not moral.</p>

<title>Williamstown</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This Saturday we took the train out to 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamstown%2C_Victoria">Williamstown</a>, a
waterfront neighborhood near where we’re staying.
We found its charm considerable despite the putrid weather, a uniquely
Australian combination of grey skies, high temperature, and howling wind.</p>
<p>Nelson Street runs along the waterfront and is mostly restaurants, mostly
pretty nice-looking, with a few boutiques selling New Age Nostrums and
eclectic music.  We ate at The Groove Lounge; I picked it
because they were obviously Greek and I have an ethnic prejudice in favor of
Greeks as cooks, whatever the genre.  I recommend it heartily; the food was
perhaps not the most daringly original, but it was outstandingly tasty, and
the waitresses were competent, friendly, and cute; they made a big fuss over
our baby.</p>
<p>Here’s a picture from the park by the pier, looking back at Nelson
Street.</p>
<img src="IMGP4470.jpg" alt="Nelson Street in Williamstown, Victoria, Australia" />
<p>The pier has an old Navy ship serving as a floating museum.  Then we
walked over to the beach side of Williamstown, enjoying the residential
architecture, both old and new; I think Australia may just be the world
leader in that department.</p>
<p>It’s been dry:</p>

<title>JRuby January</title>

<body>
<p>In this month’s JRuby news,
<a href="http://tomayko.com/articles/2006/12/30/ruby-java-co-op">Ryan Tomayko
goes all visionary</a>, Charles Nutter
<a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/2007/01/invokedynamic-actually-useful.html">ponders
InvokeDynamic</a>, and 
<a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/2007/01/welcome-nick-sieger-to-jruby-team.html">Nick
Sieger’s a committer</a>.
I partially disagree with Ryan’s point #3.  My impression
has been that the average Java package is at least as well-maintained as in any
other language you care to name, and better than some (but he’s right, of
course, that the maintenance activity needs start manifesting quickly via your
local apt or yum or whatever).
Also, Ryan recommends Ruby when “where readability and maintainability are
more important than performance and reuse”.  Uh, isn’t readability a really
important factory in re-usability?  Which means that Charles should be (and
probably is)
worrying about calling Ruby code from Java, not just the other way.
Anyhow, JRuby’s a hotter and hotter area.
I watch the JRuby developer newslist, which I don’t recommend unless you’re an
enthusiast; on a good day Ola Bini alone can saturate the average inbox.</p>

<p>The moon over Melbourne on a delightful Southern Hemisphere summer evening.</p>
<img src="IMGP4450.jpg" alt="Moon over Melbourne" />
<p>The weather here is maddening.  We have gone native, which is to say we get
around mostly using the trains and walking.  This has often been uncomfortable
with the humidity high, the temperature above 30°C, the wind hot and gusty.
But in the evening, we almost always eat outside, and the air suddenly feels
like skin balm, the gentled wind a caress.</p>
<p>Photopurists will be irritated by the obvious grain the lens artifacts, and
the insufficient detail, but the picture looks to me like the evening air
feels.</p>

<title>Byrne on Music</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Almost everything
<a href="http://journal.davidbyrne.com/">David Byrne</a> writes is
interesting, but when 
<a href="http://journal.davidbyrne.com/2007/01/1207_crappy_sou.html">the 
subject is music</a> and you’re someone who cares about it, you really want to
read it.  While he falls for the “an LP has more information than a
CD” canard, and that in an essay where he has earlier considered the effects of
CD’s vastly-superior handling of the high and low ends of the frequency range,
it doesn’t really weaken the force of his argument.  Many will probably be too
young to spot that his title <cite>Crappy Sound Forever!</cite> is a
reference to the initial 1983 CD marketing pitch “Perfect sound
forever”.  This pitch was widely derided by audiophiles, who justly criticized
the bleed-from-the-ears effect resulting from playing quite a few of the early
CDs on quite a few of the early players. 
Byrne speculates about the kind of music that might start to be written under
the influence of the ubiquitous MP3 players’ private listening experience, and
says he doesn’t know of any examples.  My own
private-listening-experience music includes pretty well every kind of music
imaginable, so the new medium doesn’t seem to rule anything out.  Having said
that, 
<a href='http://www.bongobeat.com/LolDu_TheWoOf.php'>Lola Dutronic</a> (@
<a href='http://www.myspace.com/loladutronic'>MySpace</a>) has been in heavy
rotation on my iPod and matches Byrne’s criteria well.  Mind you, it also
sounds great on the home stereo and in the car.</p>

<p>Both Vancouver and Melbourne are gardener-friendly, you
can grow most things, but the constraints are different.  There’s no frost here
and never a shortage of sun; but water is often an issue, and the plants have
to be able to live with occasional dry spikes up over 40°C.  The result is
that gardens look really different; but roses feature prominently in both
places.</p>

<title>Ordinary Technology</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Our friends here in Australia are by and large not Internet Visionaries or
Serial Entrepreneurs or Multimedia Wizards; they’re ordinary people with
ordinary jobs; not only are they good people and good company, but for me educational
since I’m getting a civilian’s-eye view of the technosphere.</p>
<p>To start with, they think broadband is expensive, and to the extent they
really need it they can get it at work; so homes are WiFi-free and a lot
of Internet is still dial-up.  
Since this doesn’t work for me, I’ve been taking the train into town to plug
in (I recommend
<a href="http://www.elounge.com.au/">eLounge</a> on Elizabeth street, pretty well right across from the
Flinders Street station).</p>
<p>This isn’t an “Internet Café” really; it’s high-quality connectivity paid by the
hour for people who need it, sitting in rows of booths.  So it’s quiet and
intense.  I eavesdrop shamelessly on my neighbour’s screens.  One guy is
reading a lengthy profile of the handsome owner/chef of a Northern California
restaurant.  A woman is emailing: “Been too long miss you bubs”.  Another is
taking notes from a list entitled “What We Look For In An Employee”.  An all-male
trio is looking for a place to stay for a few months in Amsterdam.
At any one time, one person is pounding text into the Net for every two or so that
are reading.
Everybody is working through their browser; nobody is working any other
way.</p>
<p>We all know that, all over the world, huge numbers of people are facing
the Net, pushing and pulling bits and pictures and words and dreams; but in
this room you can really feel it happen, it’s not too hard to multiply the
scene by a few hundred thousand in your mind.</p> 
<p>I get to and from the Net joint by train.  The stations and tracks are from
the Nineteenth Century,
but most of the trains themselves are pretty modern, and the
system for selling and checking tickets is unobtrusively automated, Just
Works.</p>
<p>A city with a comprehensive train network is better than one
without; Vancouver falls short on this, and while we’re
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Line">working on it</a> (noisily
and disruptively, in my neighborhood) we’ll never catch up with the sunk
investment, probably worth tens of billions in today’s money, enjoyed by
places like Melbourne.</p>
<p>It’s OK to be a Pod Person on a train.  When you’re motionless in a public
place among strangers, retreating into the music seems civilized; a row of
airplane seats though creates a semiprivate space where conversation may
be in order.</p>
<p>Some of the people on the train just sit and stare.  A few read, everything
from serious books to the cheery/trashy commuter tabloid.  Others are Pod
People.  Others text;  I’ve gotten comfy with texting on this trip, since
using my Canadian mobile for conversation is unreliable and expensive.  I have to
wonder, though, why every, repeat <em>every</em>, mobile device doesn’t come
with a Gaim client.</p>
<p>Are all these people riding the trains potential iPhone customers?  I don’t
think so, because they’re just not gonna pay hundreds of dollars on top of
their regular phone bills; and I don’t see any reason why an ordinary mobile
phone shouldn’t be able to do most of the groovy iPhone stuff using mostly the
current architecture on the current network.</p>
<p>The big barrier holding back today’s mobile devices from being what they
have the potential to be isn’t the network technology or the battery
technology or the handset technology, it’s the narrow vision of the network
operators, who think they come out ahead by owning the whole relationship.</p>
<p>Of course, maybe I’m wrong.  Maybe the iPhone will have open APIs that let
me write code that makes phone calls and opens arbitrary Net connections and
does anything with the handset/cell-net/Internet combo that I can imagine.
But I have trouble seeing Cingular going there.</p>
<p>Yes, in case it’s not obvious, I think the network operators ought to open
the devices and open the APIs and open the network and specialize in
bandwidth-provisioning and billing and just bloody well get out of the way.
The Net would be more useful and they’d make more money.</p>

<p>The sun on suburban shops on a quiet morning.</p>
<img src="CRW_5196.jpg" alt="Suburban shops in Melbourne" />
<p>I gather that there do exist distant residential developments here where you
have to drive to shop, but everyone I know in Australia is within walking
distance of shops.  This set includes a
newsagent, a grocery/liquor store, a doctor, a podiatrist, a hairdresser, a pharmacy,
an alternative-health practitioner, and a junk buy-&amp;-sell.</p>
<p>The shops are basic but they seem to
be making a go of it; we’ve been coming to this neighborhood for years and the
line-up hasn’t changed much.  A few years back when I got a nasty case of
swimmer’s ear, the local doctor fixed me up on short notice at a reasonable price.</p>
<p>Note how all shops in Australia come with awnings, set up so that you can
stroll along and be out of the rain or sun.  It escapes me why this excellent
idea hasn’t spread to other locales.</p>

<p>A farm scene in Gippsland, with eucalypts and drought colours.</p>
<img src="CRW_5250.jpg" alt="Farm scene in Gippsland, Victoria" />
<p>Gippsland is a great big chunk of Victoria, the parts I’ve seen have been
farmland and beaches.  There are usually a few eucalypts left standing here and
there in their fields; since farmers tend to be an unsentimental and
not-very-green lot, I assume there’s a reason for this other than their
looking wonderful.</p>
<p>See the colour?  Gippsland is pretty brown this year, and much of it has
been burning, one of the worst fire years on record.  But in this picture, it’s
a grey sky behind the trees.</p>

<p>This is a park in Victoria quite a way east of Melbourne, famous for
beaches and rocks.  The beaches have too much seaweed in parts, mostly red
like this, the tide throws it up in huge stinking heaps where the angle of the
land is right.  Pretty in the small, though.</p>

<p>This beach is huge (I’m not sure whether it’s officially part of Gippsland’s
“Ninety Mile Beach”) and there are parts of it you can swim on, but this
isn’t one of them; the water was brutally cold this day, the waves
nasty-looking, and the locals muttered about sharks.</p>
<p>The idea of fishing out into the surf would never occur to me, but I saw
others doing it too.  I asked this fellow how he was doing and he said
“nothing today”.</p>
<p>[Yes, that’s how they spell the name, Frenches Narrows, no apostrophe or
anything.]</p>

<p>That second shot is early morning, before seven, and that red colour is
haze from the great Victorian bush-fires of the summer of 2006/07.
Some days you could smell the smoke.  You could tell this was going to be a
hot one; a few days in Australia and you develop major respect for the people
who go and fight those fires in that heat.</p>

<p>If you take off from the right end of the beach (facing sea-ward) there’s a
nice boardwalk put up by the local Aboriginal band with write-ups on the
landscape and wildlife and people.  There are a lot of shellfish here that
people ate (still eat?), what I like about them is that they weather away into
interesting flowerlike shapes.  The water’s beautiful, the shells are
beautiful, but I liked these rocks too.</p>
<p>I moronically left the camera set at ISO 800 for a whole day and thus got a
bunch of fairly-grainy shots; but in this case I like the effect.  The sky was
indeed colourless.</p>

<title>Things About Australia</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Well, we’re home.  For a six-day stretch I didn’t touch a computer once.
Lauren and I regularly talk about moving to Australia (she’s lived there), so
when we visit we always have our eyes and ears open.  Here are some observations
whose only unifying theme is a few summer days in Victoria, Australia.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Diminutives</h2>
<p>Australians share with the Swiss a love of diminutives; for example, most
obviously, “Aussie”.  Tasmania is “Tassie”, driving directions are full of
“righties” and “lefties”, mosquitoes are “mozzies”, beer bottles are “stubbies”, and
so on.  One time we were driving in the country and Sally said “lots of
kangaroos around here” and I said it would be nice to see one in the wild; she
replied “Probably not, but we might see a deadie.”</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Flies</h2>
<p>The flies are probably the single worst thing about the country.
They look like ordinary Northern-Hemisphere houseflies; they don’t bite, but
their only goal in life is to find a place on your body to sit and rest.  </p>
<p>They are diabolically clever at noticing when you’re outside and doing
something complicated, difficult, and irritating that requires the use of both
hands; you’ll have a dozen landing on your face in no time.</p>
<p>Then there are the March Flies that bite, and Australia’s many other
species of venomous spiders, snakes, and sea creatures; but it’s the flies
that bug me the most.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Kookaburras</h2>
<p>Everyone knows the old song <cite>Kookaburra sits on the old gum
tree...</cite> (you can do it as a round); but they don’t sound to me like
they’re laughing, they sound like Ornette Coleman.  I’m serious; they sing
incredibly-loud note clusters that hover around some sort of tonality, and
then two or three of them will start doing it almost in rhythm, the notes
falling over each other.  Totally
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Jazz:_A_Collective_Improvisation">Free Jazz</a>. </p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Cricket</h2>
<p>One notable feature of this trip was the endless misery of the visiting
English cricket team, which as of the time I left had lost all of its
matches, whether in the Test, One-Day, or new Twenty/20 (fun!) format.  It was
brutal.</p>
<p>I suspect that for the future the Aussies have a lock on this sport; they
have more beaches and every one of them, near as I can tell, has stumps on it
and people, all ages and genders, flinging a ball about.</p>
<p>I and the boy got to play a little beach cricket with (for the first time)
some real cricket 
players.  Fun was definitely had and I got a couple of
good whacks in.</p>
<p>In some beach cricket, the rule is that if you can catch a ball on one bounce
with one hand, the batsman’s out.  This gives an unfair advantage to baseball
players like me, who don’t know any other way to catch.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Five Hundred</h2>
<p>As in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/500_%28card_game%29">500, the card
game</a>.
It’s a grown-up version of euchre and now mostly only played down under.  It
has (for me, anyhow) just the right amount of tactical depth to allow for some
serious head-scratching while still leaving mental space for drinking and
talking.   I wonder where I can get a game in Vancouver?</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Weather</h2>
<p>The weather in northern and central Australia is straight-ahead
in-your-face brutally tropical.  But in Victoria in the summer, it’s just... raving batshit
looney.  The skies range from dull grey to brilliant blue, the temperatures
from 22°C to 38°C, sometimes within a couple of hours of each other, and the
precipitation from none for months at a time to damaging downpours.  What’s
weird is that these variables all associate randomly.  You can have a
beautiful English-summer mid-twenties sunny morning followed by a sweltering
rainy afternoon, then it’ll get chilly at night and you wake up frozen under
your single sheet.</p>
<p>But as we left, it was raining across the city and much of the state,
giving the firefighters their first help in weeks; maybe—who knows—the
beginnings of a crack in years of drought.</p>

<title>On Linking</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>In a recent <span class='o'>ongoing</span> piece, I mentioned
the “Canada Line”, a huge construction project currently disrupting
Vancouver.   Motivated in part by
the 2010 Winter Olympics, it’s a subway/elevated train connecting the city
core, the airport, and everything on the path between them, including a big
strip of central Vancouver and Richmond, the suburb with the airport.
(It’s called the “Canada Line” because the biggest chunk of funding is from the
Federal, as opposed to provincial or city government).  Since I’m writing for
the Net, I wanted to link to it.  I did a quick search for 
<a href="http://www.canadaline.ca/">its Web site</a>, which also turned up a pretty good
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Line">Wikipedia
entry</a> on the subject.  The question is, which to link to?  The answer
isn’t obvious.</p> 
<h2 id='p-1'>Why Wikipedia?</h2>
<p>One great thing about the Web is that everyone can be part of it, and another
is that anyone can link to anyone, and a particularly great thing about blogs
is that they do so a lot.</p>
<p>The trouble with the Web is that like everything else, per
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon's_Revelation">Sturgeon’s Revelation</a>,
90% of it is crap.  In particular, a lot of institutional sites are pathetic
self-serving fluff served up in anodyne marketing-speak with 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/09/15/Wikipedia#p-4">horrible URIs</a> that
are apt to vanish.</p>
<p>Linking to the Wikipedia instead is tempting, and I’ve
succumbed a lot recently.  In fact, that’s what I did for the Canada
Line.  After all, the train is still under construction and there’s no real
reason to expect today’s links to last; on top of which, the Line’s own site
is mostly about selling the project to the residents and businesses 
who (like me) are getting disrupted by it, and the taxpayers who
(like me) are paying for it.</p>
<p>Wikipedia entries, on the other hand, are typically in stable locations,
have a decent track record for outliving transient events, are pretty good
at presenting the essential facts in a clear, no-nonsense way, and tend to be
richly linked to relevant information, including whatever the
“official” Web site might currently happen to be.</p>
<p>At this point in history, the Wikipedia continues to look good,
and the cheap-shot artists who dislike it when the general public is
allowed to help write the Great Books, such as Bob “Wikipedia is like a public
toilet” McHenry and Andrew “Khmer Rouge in Daipers <i>(sic)</i>” Orlowski, are
looking bad. 
(The jury is still out on Nicholas Carr’s contention that the
Wikipedia is inexorably evolving away from its populist roots into something
like a conventional reference-publishing project.)</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Why Not Wikipedia?</h2>
<p>But this makes me nervous.
I feel like I’m breaking the rules; being able to link to original
content, without benefit of intermediaries, is one of the things that defines
the Web.  More practically, when I and a lot of other people start linking to
Wikipedia by default, we boost its search-engine mojo and
thus drive a positive-feedback loop, to some extent
creating a single point of failure;
another of the things that the Web isn’t supposed to have.</p>
<p>I’d be astonished if the Wikipedia suddenly went away.  But I wouldn’t be
very surprised if it went off the rails somehow:
Commercial rapacity, legal issues,
or (especially) bad community dynamics, we’ve seen that happen to a whole
bunch of once-wonderful Internet resources.  If and when it did, all those
Wikipedia links I’ve used (396 so far, starting in June 2004) become part of
a big problem.</p>
<p>[Let me be clear: I am an unabashed partisan of Wikipedia.  I think it is a
triumph, a piece of evidence that being human is no bad thing; and I’ll do
what I can, when I can, to help it.  If I think I see it going sideways I’ll be in
there shrieking and fighting.]</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Learn From History?</h2>
<p>Obviously, the notion that writers should insert
links to other relevant information didn’t first appear on the Web: it’s at
the core of academic publishing.
The word
“scholarly” applies to work in which no assertion may stand
unaccompanied by supporting evidence;  I think scholarly is good.</p>
<p>Academic citations, the stuff of scholarship, are not simple one-way pointers,
they are little bundles of metadata: a page (or section)
number in a particular edition of a particular published work, identified by
author, title, date, publisher, and so on.  Given the way the library system works,
there’s a high 
degree of confidence that, given the contents of a citation, you’ll be able to
track down the original.</p>
<p>Web links are clearly transient and fragile by comparison (the appeal
of linking to Wikipedia is precisely that, at the moment, it feels a little
less so).  On the other hand, you can click on them and follow them, right
here right now; and you can spin “transient and fragile” the other way, as
“dynamic and fresh”.  I don’t think, on balance, that they’re a step
backward.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Fragile  Links</h2>
<p>When I first started writing the <span class='o'>ongoing</span> articles
and content, in parallel, I was thinking about a <code>fragile="true"</code>
attribute on links, to be inserted when I thought that
there was a good chance that the <span class='o'>ongoing</span> piece would
outlive them.  The idea was that I’d fiddle the stylesheet so that
“fragile” links would look different, by way of a warning.</p>
<p>The idea was not entirely lame.  But it needed me to make a whole bunch of
judgment calls, and I quickly decided I probably wasn’t very good at guessing
at longevity; so I discarded it.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Solution: Link Bundles?</h2>
<p>If we really care about links being useful in the long term (and we should),
maybe we need to abandon the notion that a single pointer is the right way to make
one that matters.
If I want to link to Accenture or Bob Dylan or Chartres Cathedral, I can think
of three plausible ways: via the “official” sites, the Wikipedia entries,
and Google searches for the names.
[More generally, I should say: direct links, online reference-resource
links, and search-based links.  I’ll come back to that.]</p>
<p>What I want, then, is a link to a bunch of things at once.  It turns out
that there’s a perfectly good, if lightly-implemented, way to do
this in XML, called 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xlink11/">XLink</a> <i>[Disclosure: I helped create
it.]</i>.  It’s been lightly-implemented mostly I think because the browser
writers just didn’t feel any particular pull for such a thing.   This has
struck me as a little odd because every financial Web site in the world is
full of multi-ended links: every time they mention a company they’ll typically
link to its share price, some analysis, and previous articles: check out
almost any page at <a href="http://www.thestreet.com/">TheStreet.com</a>, for
example.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>One Level of Indirection</h2>
<p>I want more than multi-way links: I don’t want to jump into bed with
Wikipedia or Google or any potential single point of failure.  I’d be willing
to bet that if Wikipedia goes off the rails and some new online reference
resource comes along to compete, there’ll be an automated mapping between
Wikipedia links and the new thing; so the actual URIs may retain some value.
Similarly, a search string needn’t be tied to any one search engine.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>Linking 2.0</h2>
<p>So here’s what I’d like: a way to write multi-ended links with simple
indirection, and a reasonable way for users to display them in whatever
browser they’re using.
Fortunately, I have a nice link-rich testbed here at 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span>, with software I control, and the era of
GreaseMonkey and AJAX, who needs to wait for the browser builders?
Unless someone points out why this line of thinking is clueless or (much more
likely) points at where someone’s already solved the problem, maybe I’ll take a
run at the problem.</p>

<title>Intel Inside</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>For some cheap chuckles, check the Web sites and consider the subtle
differences between Intel’s spin and ours.  I had no idea this was going to
happen this week, but a few months ago I was in a room where
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Bechtolsheim">Andy Bechtolsheim</a>
allowed that, yes, Intel was playing some damn decent catch-up, so the writing
was pretty well on the wall.  Andy’s explanation of the finer points of the
trade-offs requires the best part part of two whiteboards to lay
out and an alert well-caffeinated mind to follow, so I won’t even try.  But... ain’t
competition wonderful?  For the foreseeable future, I bet almost all systems
vendors will ship both Intel &amp; AMD silicon.  Hearty, honest congrats to
Intel for getting back in the game.  Both sides of the arrangement look to me like a
win for both sides; as Otellini says, Solaris is a big deal in some
markets that Intel wants more of, and if they say they can make it run better
on the chips they build, I’d be inclined to believe them.  Should be fun times
in the server biz, hang on tight.</p>

(<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/12/11/Mingus">recently discussed</a> in this

It first appeared on Mitchell’s
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mingus_%28album%29">Mingus</a> in 1979
but I no longer have that version; this is about the version on the 1980
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadows_and_Light">Shadows and
Light</a>, a live set featuring Jaco Pastorius, Pat Metheny, Lyle Mays,
Michael Brecker, Don
Alias, and The Persuasions.  The whole record is worthwhile, great in spots.
<cite>Dry Cleaner</cite> is pure genius-level musical fun.

<img src="Joni-Mitchell.png" alt="Joni Mitchell by Bill Smith" />
<div class="caption"><p>Photo by
<a href="http://vancouverjazz.com/billsmith/photo/index.shtml">Bill Smith</a>,
whose music I’m going to have to check out as a result of looking up this
photo.</p></div> 
<h2 id='p-1'>The Context</h2>
<p>How could anyone dislike Joni?  She’s written some of the most beautiful
songs ever, she plays and sings wonderfully, and brilliant musicians stick to
her like glue (as on this record).  Well, I have a problem with her approach
to slow songs; too much styling and punctuation, not enough getting behind the
flow of the music (<cite>Dry Cleaner</cite> is not a slow song).  Still, I’d find it hard
to live without my copies of <cite>Blue</cite> or <cite>Court and
Spark</cite>; and really hard without <cite>Shadows and Light</cite>.</p>
<p>I’m assuming that most people don’t need any education as to who Ms
Mitchell is, and if you do there’s nothing I have to add on what’s out
there.</p>
<p>But I have to say I remember a weekend afternoon in the late Eighties, sitting in
the Grad Club at the University of Waterloo drinking beer and playing
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28board_game%29">Go</a> with Dave
(uh, I forget Dave’s other name); they were playing <cite>Court and
Spark</cite> on the audio and eventually both of us were just staring
across the board and I said “Damn, that’s some great music” or something
equally vapid, but still.</p> 
<p>For my money her greatest song is <cite>Both Sides Now</cite>
but lots of people have sung it better than her; I’m almost certain I remember an
endless Seventies night’s work with an incandescent live version by Don “American Pie”
McLean playing over and over on a short loop of a few songs, but I can’t find
any evidence for its existence.</p>
<img src="Shadows-and-Light-cover.png" alt="Cover of Shadows and Light" class="inline" />
<h2 id='p-2'>The Music</h2>
<p>Obviously, with Metheny and Pastorius and the rest, this is the best band
Joni ever had.  When the songs are slow, Pat and Jaco are more interesting;
when the tempo picks up, her vocals start to feel like a peer with the rest of
the instruments.  And the Persuasions have never been anything but
brilliant, that I’ve heard.</p>
<p><cite>Dry Cleaner</cite> is my favorite cut, because it’s a great tune, it’s
<em>funny</em>, Joni has fun singing it and doesn’t try to
over-interpret; she couldn’t if she wanted to because it’s happening really
<em>really</em> fast.
There aren’t many bands in the world that could play this
music at this speed but they make it sound easy, and the song ends with a
Pastorius-led rave-up that will make your jaw drop if you listen
carefully.</p>
<p><cite>Amelia</cite> (as in Earheart) is the next song; it tucks all the 
<cite>Dry Cleaner</cite> madness in under a nice clean white
sheet with a goodnight kiss; I can’t imagine to listening either of the two
songs without the other.</p>
<p>There are other songs that touch me.  <cite>Coyote</cite>, if only for the
lyric</p>
<blockquote><p><i>And we're dancing close and slow<br/>
Now he's got a woman at home<br/>
He's got another woman down the hall<br/>
He seems to want me anyway<br/></i></p></blockquote>
<p>and my memory of her wonderfully-sluttish shudder doing it at <cite>The
Last Waltz</cite>.</p>
<p>Several of the band members have solos, but you can only hear Metheny’s
unless you get the double-LP version.  I think this may be a good choice.</p>
<p><cite>Dreamland</cite> is in the Neville Brothers spirit, Joni taking it
solo with just her then-lover Don Alias on percussion, fast and smooth, and with
the supremely 
Canadian lyric “On the plane headed back to winter/shoes full of tropic sand”.</p>
<p>There’s a pure-fun romp through <cite>Why Do Fools Fall in Love?</cite>,
with some hard-sax magic by Michael Brecker.</p>
<p>The title track is over-written, but if you sing anything in front of the
Persuasions, well, it’s going to sound good.</p>
<p>Finally... well, I kind of blush.  Is it possible, in A.D. 2007, to take
the song <cite>Woodstock</cite> seriously?  If (hypothetically) it were, this
is obviously the best version ever recorded by anyone.  And after all, we
<em>are</em> billion-year-old carbon.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Sampling It</h2>
<p>I suppose this is probably hard to buy these days.  Given that, sampling
its fruits via network piracy may be forgivable.  But if you can find a way
to buy either the LP, the CD, or the DVD (used-music shops may be your best bet), go for it, the sound quality is way
above average, and even the weak songs have Joni Mitchell singing them with an
outstanding band behind her.</p>
<p>My first choice would be the LP, because it has both the not-bad-at-all
<cite>Black Crow</cite> and a very decent <cite>Free Man in Paris</cite>,
another song that’s too fast for “vocal stylings”, and the band is lots better
than one on the top-40 hit original.
Also the LP sound’s a little truer.  But vinyl’s a specialized taste these days.</p>

<body>
<p>My goodness, even CNN
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/internet/01/24/microsoft.wikipedia.ap/index.html?eref=rss_topstories">picked
up</a> the story about Microsoft trying to retain Rick Jelliffe to update
the Wikipedia articles on ODF and OOXML for them, just as the ISO process
around OOXML is getting in gear.    This raises complicated
issues about document formats and transparency and conflict of interest; and
there’s at least one elephant in the room.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Editing Wikipedia</h2>
<p>This news noise prompted me to check out the 
relevant Wikipedia guidelines, on 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Autobiography">Autobiography</a>
and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest">Conflict
of Interest</a>.  I confess to never having read them previously, and now I
feel bad, because I’ve edited my own entry a couple of times (contributing a
picture is OK they say, but I’ve fixed some broken grammar and minor factual
errors, which isn’t).</p>
<p>Worse, I’ve done a <em>lot</em> of editing on the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems">Sun</a> entry.
In my defense, when I first went to work it was a
disorganized, ungrammatical mess, and I’ve always edited while
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:TimBray">signed in</a>, so it’s
been transparent (if it were
up to me, signing in would be a requirement for 
<em>all</em> editing).
So I guess I’ll have to do any further contributing via the Discussion page.  Which
is OK, since I’ve noticed the editing standard has picked up recently on this
page and my services are probably superfluous.</p>
<p>So if Microsoft thinks the articles on OOXML and ODF are inaccurate
(haven’t read them in ages, I have no opinion) I think they should have someone
smart, reasonable, open-minded, and <em>from Microsoft</em> go pitch in on the
discussion page and have the necessary arguments and work out a compromise
that gets the NPOV (“Neutral Point Of View”) nod from the community, and based
on my experience, the result will be good.</p>
<p>But let’s ascend from the meta level to the document-format issues
themselves.</p> 
<h2 id='p-2'>ODF and OOXML</h2>
<p>I was really impressed with the 
<a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20070123071154671">collaborative
effort at Groklaw</a> to give the OOXML ECMA document a thorough going-over.
The
<a href="http://www.grokdoc.net/index.php/EOOXML_objections">objections
document</a> is interesting; valuable work, but I don’t think they turned up
much that wasn’t already known.</p>
<p>Having said that, I still think OOXML is totally bogus; ECMA shouldn’t have
gone near it and neither should ISO.
The world does <em>not</em> need two ways to say “This paragraph is in
12-point Arial with 1.2em leading and ragged-right justification”.
As I 
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/11/27/Office-XML">argued
in 2005</a>, if you want to capture MS-Office-specific semantics (not a
bad thing in principle) the right way to do it is a namespaced layer on top of
ODF.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>The Elephant in the Room</h2>
<p>[Disclosure: Rick Jelliffe has been a colleague and personal friend for at
least fifteen years.]  I’m a little irritated at Rick just at the moment; he’s
been writing regularly over at his (excellent)
<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/1712">O’Reilly blog</a> about ODF
and OOXML, and is resolutely ignoring the elephant in the room: the reasons
that ODF and OOXML exist, and the motivations behind standardizing
them.  This is weird because Rick’s been doing publishing technology for a
living for decades and knows these issues as well as anyone in the world.
Rick’s opinion matters, because he is an “invited expert” (non-voting)
<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2007/01/an_interesting_offer.html#comment-438087">member
of ISO SC34</a>,
the committee that recently approved ODF and will soon be deciding whether to
approve OOXML.</p>
<p>Let’s be blunt: ODF was standardized for both idealistic and commercial
reasons. 
Both are easy to understand: Idealists want information to be as free as
its creator wants to make it, long-lived, and re-usable.
Commercially, ODF is a straightforward attempt to crack open
the Microsoft lock on the business desktop and allow office-suite
competition to start happening.  Wait, that’s kind of idealistic too, if you
believe in the benefits of free markets.</p>
<p>OOXML was standardized defensively because Microsoft was worried that the
standardization of ODF might achieve its commercial goals, and Microsoft’s
lock on the office-suite market is worth some eight billion dollars
of monopoly profits (as in $8B on $11B of revenue; jeepers!) each
fiscal year.</p>
<p>You might be able to conduct an cool-headed objective dialogue about the
relative technical merits of these formats without considering the issues of
freedom on the one hand and billions of dollars of commercial impact on the
other, but I can’t. </p>
<p>What do you think about all this, Rick?</p>
<p><i>[Disclosure/Historical footnote: 
Those with long memories might suggest a
parallel between Rick’s position and mine when in 1997, I was sitting on the
XML Working Group and co-editing the spec, on a <i>pro bono</i> basis as an
indie consultant.
Netscape hired me to represent their interests, and when I announced this,
controversy ensued.  Which is a nice way of saying that 
Microsoft went berserk; tried unsuccessfully to get me fired as co-editor, and
then launched a vicious, deeply personal extended attack in which
they tried to destroy my career and took lethal action against a small
struggling company because my wife worked there. It was a sideshow of a
sideshow of the great campaign to bury Netscape and I’m sure the executives
have forgotten; but I haven’t.  Anyhow, I thought I had to point that out
first before somebody else dredged it up, but I totally don’t think Rick’s
status played in this story and I’m also 100% confident of his
integrity.]</i></p>

<title>Which Mac?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>My PowerBook (the last PowerPC model) still serves me pretty well, but I
need to do some Solaris stuff, so one of the new Intel Macs is in my
future.  Not quite ready to unSwitch for day-to-day work yet; it seems
the latest Linuxes still have issues with outboard displays and power
management [now 37 people are going to write me to tell me how you can make that
work, each providing their own multi-step recipe].
So the question is, MacBook or MacBook Pro?  The answer isn’t obvious.
<i>[Update: So far, 12 commenters recommend the Pro, 10 the MacBook; three say to
wait for the next product refresh.]</i></p>
<p>Fortunately, I have a terrific resource, namely the Mac-users mailing list
here at Sun, which is erudite and prolific.  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you!
Here’s what I’ve gathered so far.</p>
<p>The MacBook has some real advantages: Looks cooler (I am <em>so</em> tired
of carrying a silver 
laptop), weighs less, smaller, longer battery life.
<i>[Commenters add: smaller is a bigger deal than lighter, the catch is better,
and it feels stronger.  On the other hand, both the white and the black get
grubby-looking faster than the silver.]</i></p>
<p>But then so does the Pro: Max 3G RAM instead of 2, and can take a cellular modem
card. <i>[Commenters point out you can get cellphone connectivity on the
MacBook too, with either
Bluetooth or a USB modem.]</i></p>
<p>There are some other Pro advantages that I don’t think I care about:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Lighted keyboard; but my PowerBook has one and I almost never
use it. <i>[Commenters generally agree.]</i></p></li>
<li><p>Better video card; but people say you can
watch and edit video just fine on the MB. <i>[Commenters seem to agree, but
not if you’re going to do much Aperture or Second Life.]</i></p></li>
<li><p>Bigger screen; but at a desk, I
usually have an outboard screen. <i>[Commenters have real issues with the
little screen.]</i></p></li>
<li><p>Handles a 30" outboard screen; I don’t feel the need to expand beyond
my current 24" model, but this <em>might</em> be an issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Optional matte screen; but glossy’s OK with me. <i>[Commenters mostly
agree.]</i></p></li>
<li><p>Has FireWire 800 (and I do have one LaCie disk that supports it); but I
don’t think the raw data speed is the limiting factor for much of my outboard
work.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-3'>Unknown</h2>
<p>The keyboards are quite different.  Since I touch-type demonically fast,
this matters.  I’ll need to find a MacBook and spend some time typing on its
keyboard to see if I can handle it. <i>[Commenters say “no problemo”.]</i></p>
<p>What am I missing?</p>

<a href="http://www.figuiere.net/hub/blog/">Hubert Figuière</a> , very

“Actually there is no need for a multi-step Linux-that-work-on-laptop how
to. Just purchase a model that is known to be well supported.”</p>
<p>He’s got a
point.  I think it’s perfectly reasonable to look to hardware providers to do
this kind of corner-case integration.  After all, that’s how Apple makes
things Just Work, by controlling the hardware.
I remember one of the best laptops I ever had, a Toshiba Portegé
ultraportable that came with Windows 95.  Suspend/resume worked flawlessly
every time; I’d go for weeks without rebooting.  At the time, Win95 was
clearly the world’s best personal-productivity OS, and Toshiba applied just
the right amount of hardware-sensitive fairy dust.</p>
<p>So someone who ships a light, small, powerful laptop with Ubuntu nicely
integrated, and takes care of the power management and display adapter and so
on so I don’t have to worry about it, well, they can probably steal my
business from Apple.</p>

with the idea</a> of selling products without poison oops I meant

Chris Anderson takes it further, 
<a href="http://www.longtail.com/the_long_tail/2007/01/give_away_the_m.html">arguing</a>
that the economics of music favor performance over recording.  (I’m not sure
about that, I still think selling recordings is a good business). 
Andrew Orlowski over at the Reg has a
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/01/25/keith_harris_interview/">lengthy
and instructive interview</a> with music management
maven Keith Harris covering related territory.
But the future is already here.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/">James Governor</a> sent me a
link to <a href="http://www.itwriting.com/blog/?p=100">Tim Anderson</a>
writing about <a href="http://www.linnrecords.com/">Linn Records</a>, who are
an interesting outfit.
The other half of the company is 
<a href="http://www.linn.co.uk/">Linn Audio</a>,
a successful and long-lived Scottish manufacturer of high-end audio
equipment, generally regarded as very good by those who care about such
things.  I have a Linn pre-amp and CD player and am very fond of them.
All the high-end audio makers say the (lavish,
expensive) technology is just a footnote to the music, but Linn really means
it, they’re actually in the business of producing and selling music not just hardware.
I have Shostakovich’s <cite>Symphony #5</cite> on Linn with Dmitriev and the
Leningrad Symphony; both the performance and sound are lovely.</p>
<p>Anyhow, you can go to that Linn Records site and buy the music for
download, poison-free, encoded either in the usual MP3, or in uncompressed
CD-quality WMA or, for some of the music, “studio master” quality, at a higher
bit-rate than native CD.
The higher the quality, the more you pay.  The prices are higher than the
iTunes music store, but then you’re getting more and you’re not getting
poisoned.
</p>
<p>They can’t offer Apple Lossless Encoding because

<title>XML 2.0?</title>

<a href="http://annevankesteren.nl/2007/01/xml-20">suggests</a> an XML 2.0

error handling, provoking
<a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2007/01/26/XML-2-0">further
discussion</a> over chez Sam Ruby.</p>
<p>I was recently asked about this by Xavier Borderie in an
<a href="http://developpeur.journaldunet.com/itws/070129-itw-sun-bray.shtml">interview</a>
currently appearing at <cite>Journal du Net</cite>.   Since not all 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> will be able to read my incredibly-polished
French (well actually, Xavier translated my English, but I nit-picked the
translation), I thought I should give the English version here:</p>
<blockquote><p>Micah Dubinko 
<a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2007/01/10/is-xml-20-under-development.html">asks</a> “Is HTML on the Web a special case?”, and the answer is obviously
“yes”.  Note that the HTML language being developed by the WhatWG is not XML
at all, and I'm not brave enough to predict whether that is a good idea.</p>
<p>There have always been a few tools that processed XML data but also accepted
broken (non-XML) data; for example, every Web browser.  It seems unlikely to
me that there will ever be an official new release called “XML 2.0” that has
different error-handling rules.  But I'm sure that the arguments about when to
apply real XML error handling and when software should accept non-XML data
will go on forever; among other things they are quite entertaining.</p>
<p>There's a
spectrum of situations: at one end, if an electronic-trading system receives
an XML message for a transaction valued at €2,000,000, and there's a problem
with a missing end tag, you do <em>not</em> want the system guessing what the
message meant, you want to report an error.  At the other end, if someone
sends a blog post from their cellphone with a picture of a cute kitten, you don't want to
reject it because there's an “&amp;” in the wrong spot.  The world is
complicated.</p>

<title>Tag Scheme?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>In Atom, categories have schemes.  What scheme should we use for tags?</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_%28metadata%29">Tags</a> and
categories are pretty obviously the same thing, although some
existing publishing systems store and handle them separately.  Categories are
often apt to be hierarchical, tags never (that I know of).
In an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29">Atom</a> feed, both are
represented by the <code>category</code> element.  For example, 
this article is in the category “Technology/Web”, so the Atom feed
contains:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;category scheme='http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/What/' term='Technology/Web' /></code></pre>
<p>Suppose I wanted to tag it, uh, “Tagging”.  What value should I supply for
<code>scheme</code>?  Just leave it blank?  (Atom allows that.)  Or maybe
nthere should be a well-known scheme value saying “This is one of those, you
know, Web-2.0, 
<a href="http://www.everythingismiscellaneous.com/">Everything Is
Miscellaneous</a>, folksonomy, tagsonomy, groovy ‘Tag’ thingies, not a boring
fusty old hierarchical ‘category’.”</p>
<p>This is one of the few situations in which I can imagine being comfortable
with a URN, and looking at the
<a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces">URN Namespace
Registry</a> reveals that <code>urn:tag</code> isn’t used.  Should I write an
Internet Draft and register it?  Then my Atom feed could have:</p> 
<pre><code>&lt;category scheme='urn:tag' term='Tagging' /></code></pre>
<p>Or is there an obviously-better idea?</p>
<p><i>[Update: I whipped up a
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/tmp/tag-urn.html">urn:tag I-D</a>.]
[Lots of intelligent points raised in the comments; I dropped one in to
address them.  I still think this is a good idea.]</i></p>

<body>
<p>It’s been an incredibly nasty winter so far, but this last week has been
cold/bright, what Vancouver gives you when it’s not grey/mild.</p>
<p>This is Cambie Street, currently the victim of an in-progress rape by the
builders of the “Canada Line” subway, which I suspect will be a good thing
once it’s done but the pain is pretty extreme while the act is in progress.
Anyhow, they’re going to have to take down the old streetlights while they dig
the big trench so they put up temporary new ones first and I thought the
double streetlights were interesting.</p>
<img src="CRW_5275.jpg" alt="Cambie Street under construction in winter" />
<p>This week’s weather variation has been morning fog, which can’t help but be
dramatic in winter at 50°N latitude with the sun hangin’ way low.</p>

<p>Our
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/06/11/Now-We-Are-Four">daughter</a> will soon
be  eight months old (so fast!) and is learning to crawl—wait, didn’t
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_To_Crawl">somebody already say
that</a>?—actually, she knows she wants to but can’t yet.</p>
<p>You can get charts telling you what your baby ought to be
doing at five months, seven months, nine months, and they’re all just averages,
which is to say wrong.  There are two things you need to know about babies:
First, they’re all different.  Second, the first paragraph in 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Spock">Dr. Spock</a>: <em>You
know more than you think you do</em>, which is to say, a few months into your
child’s life, you are now the world’s leading expert on this small and
unformed,  but
doing the best she or he can with what she or he has, person, and don’t you
forget it.</p>
<p>Anyhow, our girl could sit up confidently way ahead of what the charts
said; per the charts she should have been crawling or rolling or otherwise
mobile by now, but she just wasn’t interested.  And her parents
were co-conspirators; the great thing about a pre-crawling baby is that you
can put her down on the floor and go and do what you need to do and when you
come back, well, there she is.</p>
<p>Things changed; she’s noticed that there’s a horizon, even if it’s only what
you can’t see behind the foot-stool.  Starting from sitting up, the first step
is a lunge aimed right (or left); then you have to extract the left (or
right) leg from underneath you. That accomplished, you’re face-down and, you
may well ask, what’s next?</p>
<p>At this point, I should observe that all the best parents’ references
now recommend “tummy time”.  Because in our
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_infant_death_syndrome">SIDS</a>-aware
age, babies all sleep on their backs exclusively, to the extent that they 
have bald spots where the hair wears off.</p>
<p>Thus “tummy time” to develop neck strength.  My little
daughter and I are unconvinced;  I because her neck is plenty strong, she
because she hates being face-down.</p>
<p>But there’s no other way to learn to crawl.  She’s tried a whole bunch of
different twists and turns, none of which have yet worked.  Until
you watch a miniature human working through all the permutations of wiggling
torso and arms and legs, very few of which lead anywhere, you can’t possibly
appreciate how different we are from the other animals that learn how to stand
in hours not months.</p>
<p>But anyhow, Lauren’s putting the folding gates in place blocking off the
staircases, because when a human being, no matter how small, decides to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Going_Mobile">go mobile</a>,
you know it won’t take long.</p>

signals include the general trashing of the whole WS-* stack by
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/01/wos-papers/gall">Gartner’s Nick Gall</a>,
the continuing broadsides (latest
<a href="http://wanderingbarque.com/nonintersecting/2007/01/14/it-is-hard-to-be-a-dove/">here</a>)
from Pete Lacey, and 
<a href="http://www.sdtimes.com/fullcolumn/column-20070115-02.html">Give It a
REST</a>, a solid piece of argument from Larry O’Brien.
But I think the real take-away, while a little subtler than “WS-* is broken”,
is becoming pretty obvious.</p>
<p>Start with
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/01/wos-papers/bt">Services on the Web and Web Services</a>,
a position paper from British Telecom.  I quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So the SOAP “stack” is a mess, and currently only the simplest of services
are able to interoperate. However we believe this situation is likely to
improve long term, in part due to the adoption of profiles published by the
WS-I, but mainly due to the emergence of a reference implementation in the
form of Microsoft’s WCF. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>More evidence: Our Robin Wilton recently asked
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/racingsnake/entry/can_sun_do_ws">Can Sun do
WS-*?</a>, which is about our “Project Tango”.  The idea is to work with
Microsoft to
shake things down so that Java’s WS-* interoperates with WCF,
their implementation.</p>
<p>It’s not as though there’s a lot of choice.  Basically every .NET-centric
developer now has WCF in their hands, and the tooling is good, so it’ll be
easy for them to expose things via WS-*, so they will.   Because of the basic
brokenness of WS-*, it’s silly to expect this to just interoperate with other
implementations; you need a fairly major bipartisan effort to get any two
instances of this booger to play nice.
Microsoft’s customers and Sun’s customers are pretty well the same people, and
they expect these things to work the way the architecture astronauts claim
they will.</p>
<p>If there were any startups betting their future on WS-* they’d pretty well
be toast, because they’d have real trouble getting attention from either
the .NET or Java teams.  But that’s OK, because startups are generally too
smart to bet on this kind of crock.</p>
<p>WS-*?  In the real world, it’s about being able to interoperate with WCF,
and while that’s a worthwhile thing, that’s all it’s about.  It’s not like
HTTP or TCP/IP, truly interoperable frameworks, it’s like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Component_Object_Model">DCOM</a>;
the piece of Windows’ network-facing surface that Microsoft would 
like you to code to.  For now, anyhow; it’ll be at least as easy as DCOM to
walk away from when the embarrassment gets too great.</p>

<title>Princebowl Sunday</title>

<body>
<p>Wow, was that music hot, or what?  I get the feeling that Prince 
decided some heavy rain would help his visuals and he had so much mojo going
into this particular Sunday that God took his call and set it up.
I wonder how much rehearsing it takes to pull together something
that choreographed and have it come off on the first-and-only-chance
performance, weather be damned?
We had a bunch of people over, so I was hosting and missed quite
a bit of the game, but I grabbed a seat at halftime, and turned it up and told ’em to shut
up when the music started.  By the way, I made
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/paulhu/entry/beef_stifado">Paul Humphreys’s Beef
Stifado</a> for the after-game dinner, and it came out great; heartily recommended for a
good solid feed on a cold winter day.  Looked just like Paul’s picture.  I
doubled the recipe and quadrupled the garlic.</p>

<title>Groovy Flickr Escape Hatch</title>

<body>
<p>In the mail from Manning this week, <cite>Groovy in Action</cite>, nicely
timed to follow up on the 1.0 release.  I still haven’t made up my mind about
<a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a>, so I’m watching the
community with interest.   For example, Alex Brown’s
<a href="http://adjb.net/index.php?entry=entry070204-183840">Bulk Programmatic
Conversion of Photos from flickr to SmugMug</a>.  There are a bunch of
interesting issues all mixed up here: Yahoo’s identity ploy,
wildly-contrasting Web programming interfaces, choosing from the lengthy list
of Java XML-processing alternatives; and of course, watching Groovy at work.
I have to say the source code is real easy to read; oddly, what it makes me
wish for is regex literals in Java.  Hmm, it’s not obvious to the casual eye
when you declare variables and when you don’t; I’m sympathetic to the
optional-declaration idea though.
I guess I’ll have to have a look at the book; it was cracking the Pickaxe
book’s covers that dropped me onto the slippery Ruby slope.</p>

<title>Berkeley on Parallelism</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Anyone who cares at all about taking advantage of these nasty new
microprocessors that still follow Moore’s law but sideways not just straight
up ought to go and read
<a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2006/EECS-2006-183.html">The Landscape of Parallel Computing Research: A View from Berkeley</a>.
As the title suggests, it’s an overview paper.  Thank goodness we have
universities, so that smart people who know about this stuff can invest a few
months in surveying the landscape and report back for the rest of us who are
being whipped around by the market maelstrom.
Herewith <em>way</em> too much applause and disagreement and
expansion.</p>
<p><i>[First off, thanks to Liang Chen; I’d been meaning to get around to
looking at this for a while, and he slapped a printed copy down in front of
me, which got me started.]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Logistics</h2>
<p>This is a big, thick, dense paper; I had to read it in fits and starts
while doing lots of other things and I lost track, but I bet it added up to a
couple of hours.  Also, there’s a
<a href="http://view.eecs.berkeley.edu/wiki/Main_Page">supporting wiki</a>
and a
<a href="http://view.eecs.berkeley.edu/blog/">blog</a>,
although I’m not clear whether the paper represents the conclusion of the wiki
process, or whether the material in the wiki reflects further thought.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Crunchy Research Goodness</h2>
<p>Maybe the best thing here for me is that the survey covers a bunch of research
that I’d missed.   I’m sure lots of my readers knew the
following, but I didn’t:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Internal system bandwidth is increasing much faster than latency,
they say “at least the square of the improvement in latency”.</p></li>
<li><p>Cisco has been drawing a lot of attention with their Metro chip:
188 small cores based on 130nm technologies.</p></li>
<li><p>There are some neat calculations from Amdahl’s law to suggest that
making the cores on your chip non-uniform, as in having one that’s a lot
faster than the rest, can pay off big-time.</p></li>
<li><p>As memories get bigger and cheaper and processors get faster, the
number of processor cycles to fetch something all the way from mainline RAM
gets bigger and bigger.</p></li>
<li><p>In a complicated multi-core multi-chip system, message-passing 
latency between core varies dramatically depending on how “close” the cores
are to each other.  Hmm, I feel a new acronym coming on: NuML.</p></li>
<li><p>In recent research, “Autotuners” have been showing excellent results.
It’s like this: there are a <em>lot</em> of different ways a compiler can go
about optimizing the code it generates.  It’s really tough to make the right
choices along many different optimization axes based on your best guess as
to how the underlying hardware will behave.  An autotuner explores the
optimization space by trying random permutations of lots of different settings
while running actual code, and discovers empirically what works best; you run
it once to determine the right 
compiler settings for a particular machine configuration.   Unsurprisingly,
these things can outperform the best guesses of the compiler writers.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-3'>Convincing</h2>
<p>The paper presents a few arguments I hadn’t heard before
that had me thinking (without going and plowing through all the supporting
research): that <em>has</em> to be right.</p>
<h3 id='p-4'>Finite Automata </h3>
<p>State machines have long been my personal single favorite piece of Computer
Science.  But the parallelization story isn’t good, not good at all.  Which
means they will probably become a little less central to our discipline.
Sob.</p>
<h3 id='p-5'>Multicore vs. Manycore</h3>
<p>I’d never seen “manycore” prior to reading this, perhaps it’s a term of art
in the Computer-Architecture coffee-shops.  By “multicore” they mean “what IBM
and AMD and Intel and Sun are doing now”.  By “manycore” they mean, “way more
cores, each simpler, like what the Cisco Metro is doing”.</p>
<p>They argue that “manycore” buys you more of the performance metrics that
matter.
Sounds convincing.  But also sounds hard to program.</p>
<h3 id='p-6'>Performance Counters</h3>
<p>Historically, some CPUs have had them, but they’ve been low-priority
features that got triaged out when the designers had their back to the
wall.</p>
<p>Which is just silly.  They’re easy to design, they don’t slow things down,
and in a processor whose design is getting increasingly complex along multiple
dimensions, it’s just not reasonable to ask software designers to live without
them. JIT compilers can use them, big-time.   As the study points out, ideally
you’d like existing programs (existing <em>binaries</em>, even) to run faster
on complex parallel hardware, and without hard data about where the cycles are
going, you’re pushing a hard problem very near the border of “impossible”.</p>
<h3 id='p-7'>Human Results</h3>
<p>The full title of the section is <cite>Programming model efforts inspired
by psychological research</cite>, but that’s a little misleading.  If I
understand correctly, what they mean is: Study the effectiveness of different
programming models by measuring the results delivered by actual real human
programmers who use them.</p>
<p>Well, d’oh.  Anyone who’s sat in a bar with a bunch of heavy AOP or 
Lisp wankers will sign up for this one in a flash.   Me, I
do know quite a bit about programming models <em>and</em> I know what I like,
but I don’t think I’m smart enough to predict what’s going to empower developers to
deliver, whether your efficiency metric revolves around programmer time or CPU
time.</p> 
<p>So let’s, you know, do the experiments and learn from whatever it is they
tell us?   Yes, controlling for all the variables will be hard.  In fact,
there may be some flashes of genius required in pulling together the
experimental methodology. But important science isn’t supposed to be easy.</p>
<h2 id='p-8'>Unconvincing</h2>
<p>Mother always said “If you can’t find anything nice to say, don’t say
anything.”  But this is Science, so that doesn’t apply.</p>
<h3 id='p-9'>Dwarfs</h3>
<p>The study supposes that if you could partition the universe of programming
problems into a few equivalence classes, then by optimizing your system design
for one or more of these classes you could optimize it for the problems that
fall into those baskets.  Which sounds plausible.  They call their baskets
“Dwarfs” because they started with seven of them (the number grew to
thirteen).</p>
<p>Personally, I think all these basket-weaving Dwarfs could be subtracted
from the study without loss of value.  The majority of them apply to
particular sub-disciplines of scientific computing; for example, the first
three are Dense Linear Algebra, Sparse Linear Algebra, and Spectral Methods.
Important stuff for 
people who do Scientific Computing, which is itself important stuff.</p>
<p>But I do
Web computing, which constitutes a not-insignificant proportion of all
computing, and when I consider which Dwarfs I ought to care about, well, I’m
not sure.  The wiki is a little more helpful than the paper itself, and my
best guess is that I ought to care about
<a href="http://view.eecs.berkeley.edu/wiki/Graph_Traversal">Graph
Traversal</a> and
<a href="http://view.eecs.berkeley.edu/wiki/Finite_State_Machines">Finite
State Machines</a>.</p>
<p>The first suggests that a lot of this computing depends on random memory
access latency, which accords well with my intuitions.  But I’m not sure that
all those hypothetical dwarfs were a good way to establish this.</p>
<h3 id='p-10'>Data Types and Characters</h3>
<p>The discussion data sizes and types, as they appear in programming models,
seems really weak to me.  I’m offended that in 2007 intelligent people would
still suggest either that an 8-bit datum is suitable for representing a
character, or that a 16-bit datum is suitable for representing a Unicode
character.</p>
<p>Also, they suggest direct support for “Large Integer (> 128 bits)”; but
this is hardly news.
Every programming language in the world has this, one way or another; in many of them
(Smalltalk and Ruby at least) it’s built-in to Integer and transparent to the
programmer.  Last time I suggested this might be inefficient I was gently but
firmly corrected by Avi Bryant.</p>
<h2 id='p-11'>Missing In Action</h2>
<p>The paper has surprisingly little to say about what I think is the central
program: what interface should the programmer use when dealing with multicore
or “manycore” systems?  [Oops, in fact it says one
profoundly important thing as I noted <a href="#p-7">above</a>: we ought to
measure the effectiveness of competing approaches to parallelism by measuring
the empirical results achieved with them by programmers].
I had hoped for a bit more insight or some
research results in this space.  They do note that  Software Transactional
Memory is expensive and suggest that with hardware support, it might become
very interesting; but that’s about all.</p>
<p>It seems that, based on the evidence we have right now, we can draw two
firm conclusions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Conventional thread-based concurrency is “too hard” for the general
population of programmers.</p></li>
<li><p>The combination of functional programming and message-passing (as in
Erlang or MapReduce) makes astoundingly good use of parallel systems and may
well be usable by the average programmer.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, my question: is there anything between #1 and #2?
Who knows the answer?</p>

<p>Sun schedules the Analyst Summit and the Worldwide Education and Research
Conference in the same week in San Francisco, which works well, because it
lets those of who pitch in at both (which is basically everyone
outward-facing) save on travel and transit.  But combine that with some real
interesting engineering discussions and some VIP visitors and, well, there go
three days.</p>
<img src="CRW_5294.jpg" alt="Fogtown" />
<div class="caption"><p>A blurry, grainy, glass-and-haze obscured aerial of the
place they call “Fogtown”</p></div>
<p>Anyhow, 
thanks to the people who organized the events—beautifully done, come if you
get a chance—and to everyone who took the time to talk to me—I
have mountains of notes—and
sorry to anyone who wanted to when unfortunately I had to go to the next
meeting.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Van</h2>
<p>Bloody Avis rented me a Toyota Sienna NotSoMiniVan for some reason, and I
stupidly scheduled meetings in such a way that I took three separate
round-trips between the Valley and the City; 
burned like $70 of gas in 72 hours going up and down 101; the thing’s
woofer was apparently stolen from a U2 gig and I think I may have spleen
damage.</p>
<p>Which reminds me, back in September I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/09/09/Vans-and-SUVs">wrote about van
shopping</a> and got like 100 emails with van opinions—pity the commenting
wasn’t working then—and ended up getting the safe boring predictable Honda.
Now I know that the Sienna would have been peppier, but its gearshift is an
Industrial-Design disaster while the Honda’s is a poem, so there.</p>
<img src="CRW_5290.jpg" alt="Pacific Northwest clouds" />
<h2 id='p-2'>Airlines and Inflation</h2>
<p>I so hate Aeroplan, Air Canada’s frequent-flyer program. 
I have many hundreds of thousands  of points, but in recent years it became
increasingly impossible to use them.  Tickets to attractive warm destinations?
Hah hah hah hah.  Then it got so I couldn’t even fly our parents down from
Saskatchewan.  Either they were slowly winching down the number of available
seats or there were people who’d figured out how to game the system and scoop
them all out.</p>
<p>As several economists have pointed out, there’s an immense oversupply of
frequent-flyer points, so inflation is inevitable.  And Air Canada has taken
it to the max.  Now, they advertise, they have “every seat, every flight”.  Except
for, they offer those seats at many times the number of points they used to
cost.  They talk about “classic reward seats” at the old point prices, but
those are never available to anywhere that I want to go to.  I thought
inflation was when prices inched up slowly and steadily, but in this case it’s
more like the inflationary hypotheses on the instants surrounding the big
bang.  The effect is the same: my hundreds of thousands of points can’t take
my family on vacation.  I hate ’em; when I drop by their web-site for yet
another futile attempt to cash in points, I can literally feel the hate
curdling my stomach.</p>
<p>The actual flight service seems to be getting a little better though; there
are quite a few of the new A319’s with video screens and nice 110-volt power
plugs.</p>
<p>Oh right, another reason to hate Aeroplan: their “partner” United has
summarily downgraded all us Air Canada frequent flyers so we can no longer get in the
economy-plus seats without paying (more inflation), or board early.   I was
informed of this in a tone of hateful triumph by a United employee in SFO.
Did I say I hate ’em?</p>
<img src="CRW_5293.jpg" alt="Pacific Northwest clouds" />
<p>The government’s economic read-outs show flat inflation, basically; it’s
weird, then, that I end up paying more for so many things than I used to.
It’s painfully obvious that businesses have found a zillion ways to game the
numbers, to get more money out of you without actually raising the nominal
“price” of anything.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Coda</h2>
<p>There are compensations: the people at the meetings (Sun has the
coolest customers) and what you see out of airplane windows.</p>
<p>But I’m sitting on the plane back to Vancouver with many
separate emails whimpering “<em>Please</em> deal with me <em>now</em>”, and
lots of things written but un-posted, and I
hear it’s cold and rainy at home just like in California, bah, and the baby’s
got a cold and isn’t sleeping well.  Really, I do
love this business.  Most times, anyhow.</p>

<p>While I was tied up, Mr. Jobs
<a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/">stirred</a> the
intellectual-property business pot.  Even after three days of discussion,
there are things worth saying.</p>
<p>First, while I don’t at all
hate to say “I told you so”, I’ll contain my glee to the extent of not
inserting links to the places where I did.  The music biz may be pushing back
but the end-game is obvious.
Edgar Bronfman can
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=4467">bluster all he wants</a>, but
he’s swimming upstream.</p>
<p>Second, Steve’s arithmetic is
bogus.  He calculates 22 iTMS songs per iPod on the basis that they’ve sold 90
million of them.  Well, first of all, how many of those are still in use?
Most people I know are on their second or third.  Also, the 22 number is
useless, whether it’s the mean or median.   My feeling is that there’s a large
number of people with no, or very few, iTMS tracks on their iPods, and a
smaller number with a whole lot.  I feel sorry for the latter group.</p>
<p>Steve may let his rhetoric get out of control, but in the other corner is
the music biz, and well... my goodness.  Via
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/07/technology/07music.html?ex=1328504400&amp;en=db8a9b1f487a8f53&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss">John Markoff</a>,
we hear about one senior executive saying “we’re not going to broadly license
our content for unprotected digital distribution.”  Speaking as one who is the
owner of well over a thousand shiny silver disks full of unprotected digital
music that they distributed to me happily, I have to say “Get a clue.”</p>
<p>Best of all is the RIAA, saying they’d welcome Apple licensing Fairplay and
thus proving that they didn’t actually read what Apple wrote.  You know, I
used to think that that gang couldn’t possibly be as clueless as they were
acting, what with wholesale lawsuits against their customers, that it had to
be an aspect of some crafty grand plan that I wasn’t smart enough to get.</p>
<p>I don’t think so.  The RIAA?  If it had gunpowder for brains, it still
wouldn’t be able to blow its nose.</p>

<title>Matsue, Shimane</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>What happened was, I got an email from a Japanese colleague asking if I
could come to an all-day meeting at the
<a href="http://www.sun.com/ebc/">Sun EBC</a> with the 
<a href="http://www.shimane-oss.org/">Open Source Software Society
Shimane</a>.  I wrote back saying “Huh?” and he wrote back explaining that
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimane">Shimane</a> is a prefecture in
Japan and that the delegation would include
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsumoto_Yukihiro">Yukihiro
Matsumoto</a>, also known as “Matz”, the designer of Ruby, who lives
there, and that I’d been asked for.  
I wrote back saying “OK”, and now I want to go and visit
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsue%2C_Shimane">Matsue</a>, the
capital city of Shimane, an hour’s flight from Tokyo.</p>
<p>The Shimane delegation, nearly twenty strong, squeezed a bunch of visits
into just four days in California.
Back and forth across the Pacific in that time-frame is
pretty grueling work; my hat is off to ’em.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Place</h2>
<p>To be honest I’d never heard of Matsue or Shimane, but the delegation brought
along tourist brochures and magazines and local cookies, and it seems a very
inviting place; here’s the official
<a href="http://www.city.matsue.shimane.jp/kankou/en/">Matsue tourism site</a>.
Like many people who’ve been to Japan often
on business, I’ve rarely poked my head
outside Tokyo, and Matsue looks like a good place to soak up a little bit of
the rest of the country.</p>
<img src="IMGP4627.jpg" alt="Shimane cookies" />
<p>The city authorities, with co-operation from some local IT shops including
<a href="http://www.netlab.jp/">Network Applied Communication Laboratory</a>,
the system integrator where Matz works (“NetLab” for short), have decided to
try to build up Matsue as a high-tech centre specializing in Open Source.
Sensibly taking advantage of local resources,
they’re focusing on Ruby and Rails; the initiative is called 
<a href="http://www.city.matsue.shimane.jp/jumin/sangyou/sangyou/open.html">Ruby
City MATSUE</a>.
They’ve set up an
<a href="http://www.city.matsue.shimane.jp/jumin/sangyou/sangyou/open_event_siki.html">open-source lab facility</a> right by the train station;
it looks quite decent, and I wish them luck.</p>
<p>This summer there’ll be the second annual
<a href="http://jp.rubyist.net/RubyKaigi2007/">RubyKaigi conference</a>; both
will have been in Tokyo.  Like most Ruby conferences, it sells out fast.  So
since Matsue’s only an hour away, and since foreigners like me who might want
to attend would love to get out of town, I wondered out loud, to Matz and
Hiroshi Inoue, NetLab’s president and thus Matz’s boss (odd concept, that),
why not hold it down there where Ruby comes from?</p>
<p>I’m not sure the idea had ever crossed anyone’s mind, but let’s see if it
takes hold.</p>
<img src="CRW_5302.jpg" alt="Matz photographs dinner" />
<div class="caption"><p>Matz photographs his dinner; in the background,
<a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/">Charles Nutter</a> of the JRuby project.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Visit</h2>
<p>Since it was organized by our people from Japan, it was done in the
Japanese style.  The evening before we all went out to dinner at
<a href="http://www.fukisushi.com/">Fuki Sushi</a>, which was
<em>outstanding</em>, then 
for lunch at the EBC there were <i>bento</i> boxes with, of course, more
sushi.  There was general hilarity at this; if I were entertaining Japanese
guests in California I’d give ’em steaks and West Coast Fusion Cuisine at
alternate meals.  Whatever.</p>
<p>Matz pulled out his camera for a shot of every dish, both
meals.  He explained that he wanted to show his kids back
home what he’d eaten on the trip.  Reasonable enough, I guess.</p>
<p>As for the actual business, well, they pitched Matsue and Shimane to us
(rather well, I thought) and we pitched Sun’s open-source enthusiasm to them.
Everyone who reads this has heard the Sun open-source message.  But you might
want to consider a side-trip next time you’re in Japan.</p>

<title>2007 Crocus Crop</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Round about this time every year, photos of little violet blossoms start to
show up in this space.  I worried that I might be repeating myself, but how
can posting spring flowers not be a good thing?</p>
<img src="IMGP4638.jpg" alt="February Crocuses" />
<p>This is within minutes of their first opening this year.  Last weekend I
shoveled off last fall’s dead leaves; the week was wet and not too cold and
the little shoots were taller every day, and by Friday purple-topped.  Today
was partly sunny and as the shadows retreated across the lawn I went and got
the camera.</p>
<p>To be honest, I couldn’t think of a new approach, and ended up shooting the
same flowers at the same angle against the same backdrop, just like last year;
and I can’t expect the camera to add creativity.
But that’s OK, because the crocuses never repeat themselves.</p>

<p>Caught in pixels for your, well, not pleasure exactly.  I’m talking about
the
<a href="http://www.worldpressphoto.com/index.php?option=com_photogallery&amp;task=blogsection&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=146&amp;bandwidth=high">World
Press Photo Contest Winners’ Gallery</a>.  If you have any kind of a heart,
there are pictures here that will tear holes in it.  And some that are just
insanely pretty.
This year, 
parents of babies might want to avoid looking at the “Spot News” category.</p>

<title>Blackflies and Black Boxes</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>On the grass just outside the entrance to our Menlo Park campus, there’s a
big brown rectangle where they had the
<a href="http://www.sun.com/emrkt/blackbox/">Blackbox</a> sitting; it’d been
taken up to San Francisco for the
<a href="http://www.sun.com/events/sas2007/">Analyst Summit</a> and Education
conference.</p> 
<p>I was talking to a Canadian sales guy whose territory includes a whole lot
of mountains and forests and so on; he told me he thought he could sell
a few.  I wondered about the pricing, and his come-back was instructive:
“Pricing?  We’re talking about operations at the
end of a long dirt road with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Fly">blackflies</a> in the summer
and blizzards in the winter.
Do you have any idea how much you’d have to pay skilled people to
do the work up there?  And with the economy hot, you might not even
find anyone willing to go. 
You can set up a Blackbox in regular office hours in a warehouse in Winnipeg.”</p>
<p>Hmm, I’ve never used the lights-out management tools on any of our
servers.  They’d better be good.</p>

<title>Rails and Joyent</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last week, I read about Joyent 
<a href="http://joyeur.com/2007/02/04/a-brief-update-with-some-numbers-for-hardware-load-balanced-mongrels">running
four thousand Rails requests per second</a> with a hardware load balancer fronting
six of their
<a href="http://textdrive.com/hosting/accelerator">Accelerator</a> thingies.
Then yesterday it
<a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/2/10/shiny-new-subversion-and-trac-cluster">turned out</a> that 
<a href="http://svn.rubyonrails.org/rails/">svn.rubyonrails.org/rails</a>,
the new Rails development cluster, is at TextDrive too.  Under my Sun hat I’m
happy that Solaris is apparently behind the world’s highest-performance Rails
installation and is supporting both
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/12/21/Ruby-Server">Ruby 1.9</a> and Rails development.
My take-away, though, is that the more I hear about Joyent, the more
interesting they look.</p>

<title>Microsoft</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last week I spent time talking to a lot of different technology
people, from all over the world geographically and organizationally and culturally.
The conversation kept looping back to Microsoft, and to
the same sentiment: <em>They’ve lost their mojo.</em>  Lots of people will end
up using Vista, but does anyone <em>care</em>?  The Microsoft execs look
haggard and joyless, and half the interviews feel phoned-in.  There’s real
innovation in the Office UI, and everyone says “But it’s OK, the old keyboard
shortcuts still work”.  The advertising campaign is vapid and lame, but then
that’s nothing new; they haven’t run an effective one in years.   I’m sure
that Microsoft can come back, the way IBM did after their bad patch last
century; maybe the energy is building in a building in Redmond where nobody’s
looking.  I’ve never liked Microsoft, but now I realize how much energy they
used to inject into the ecosystem, because it’s not there any more and I miss it.</p>

<title>Telnet SNAFU from the Inside</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Well, yes, there was that embarrassing mile-wide hole in telnet (I
haven’t used telnet in years except to debug Web protocols, but I guess
someone must; seems to me anyone who leaves telnetd facing the Internet is
exhibiting, uh, questionable judgment; but still.)  Nasty security gotchas are
nothing new in this world, but here’s something that is new: a
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/tpenta/entry/the_in_telnetd_vulnerability_exploit">first-hand report</a> from the guy who got the 
call you don’t want to get, and then got the patch into the system.  Actually, I don’t
understand quite a bit of the jargon: “patch gate”, “RTI logging”, and so on;
but it’s still a compelling story.</p>

<body>
<p>I’m happy;
<a href="http://cooltools.sunsource.net/coolstack/index.html">Cool Stack</a>
was just a first step.  This is something I’ve been arguing for since
approximately fifteen minutes after arriving here.  The publicity is
<a href="http://www.sun.com/solutions/nextgenweb/">here</a>,
<a href="http://www.sun.com/2007-0213/feature/index.jsp?intcmp=hp2007feb13_web_read">here</a>, and especially
here: <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/amp/index.html">Sun Optimized AMP Stack for the Solaris 10 OS</a>.
There’s lots of marketing language, but I think the essential thing is that
Sun is going to try to be a first-rate supplier of all the important pieces of
open-source Web-facing software.  The job isn’t finished yet, until
<em>all</em> of Apache and MySQL and PostgreSQL and PHP and Python 
and Ruby and Rails are in the package, all optimized for Solaris, all stuffed
with DTrace probes, and all with developer and production support available.
It won’t be long.</p>
<p>Acronyms are funny.  In LAMP, everything (but, it seems, the “A”) is
replaceable.  SAMP is kind of boring.  I proposed MARS for
MySQL/Apache/Ruby/Solaris, and the Postgresians (got a few of ’em here) like
PARS.  Or PADS for
Django-heads.  Make up your own.</p>

<p>As usual, there isn’t a unifying theme.  In this issue: lumpiness, stuff,
microformats, eye candy, metaprogramming, beards, and psychology.</p>
<p>Let’s start with Paul Kedrosky’s
<a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2007/02/03/building_the_pe.html">Building
the Perfect Board Package</a>, which quotes a “sales-guru colleague” as saying
the following: “Lumpy is not a fact of life in enterprise sw companies - lumpy
companies should never go public.”  Jeepers, can that be right?  I’ve never
been in Oracle’s board-room, but enterprise SW traditionally has been one of
the lumpiest businesses there is that doesn’t involve building nuclear power
plants or Olympic facilities.  While we’re on the subject of surprising things
in Mr. K’s vicinity, he wrote a
<a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB117106313810704156-oOFOzhK1KpRAztO1N0QjS9J70F4_20070217.html?mod=blogs">Wall
Street Journal Op-Ed</a> that concludes with “And Mr. Jobs knows that there is
pretty much zero chance the music industry will eliminate DRM. That move would
sound a death ringtone for their struggling business, making online piracy
dead simple and destroy the livelihood of an entire generation of artists.”
For the record, a high proportion of people who are educated about the issues
and don’t work for record companies do <em>not</em> believe that DRM is 
about helping artists’ livelihoods.</p>
<p>Moving on, check out my brother Rob’s
<a href="http://takingalongview.blogspot.com/2007/02/vapourings-about-stuff.html">essay
on, uh, stuff</a>, which despite its offhand tone says (I think) some fairly
profound things.</p>
<p>Back to business.  Several people have now asked me to think about Coté’s
<a href="http://www.redmonk.com/cote/2007/01/31/rfp-microformat/">RFP
Microformat</a> proposal.  The idea is compelling, all right.  How would one
build critical mass?  Hmmm.</p>
<p>While we’re still in Redmonk country, check out Steve O’Grady’s
<a href="http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2007/02/10/finally-some-linux-eye-candy/">Finally, Some Linux Eye Candy</a>.
Gotta get me some of that on my Ubuntu box.  I suspect that in the pretty near
future, this kind of UI will be a requirement for personal computers that want
to be taken seriously.  Glad that
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/harpster/entry/beryl">Harpster agrees</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s visit Rubyland.  At <cite>Practical Ruby</cite> there’s
<a href="http://practicalruby.blogspot.com/2007/02/ruby-metaprogramming-introduction.html">A Ruby Metaprogramming Introduction</a>;
interestingly, they want you to drop the entry into your programming editor
rather than read it in your browser.  So far it looks good.</p>
<p>Those outside the Ruby community have occasionally remarked that the
culture seems, well, a little weird.  They’re wrong; in fact it’s extremely
weird.  Set your weirdness-tolerance level to the absolute maximum and check
out

<p>Let’s close with a bang, namely Bruce Schneier’s
<a href="http://www.schneier.com/essay-155.html">The Psychology of Security</a>.
It’s large and it covers its subject exhaustively and uncompromisingly.  You’ll
need to set aside a chunk of time to read it, and you should read it.</p>

<title>SOA, REST, Java</title>

<body>
<p>What I usually do in this space is grumble and whine about SOA &amp; SOAP
and so on.  Today, let’s start with a 
<a href="http://www.soafacts.com/">laugh</a>, instead.   But actually, there’s
news; the Java tribe has decided to take REST seriously, see
<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=311">JSR 311</a> and, for some more
pointers, 
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/theaquarium/entry/jsr_311_java_api_for">Eduardo’s
write-up</a>.  I haven’t had time to do a deep-dive, but I’m reassured by the
presence of
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/mhadley/">Marc Hadley</a> A.K.A. the
<a href="https://wadl.dev.java.net/">WADL</a>
guy; and it looks that there will be other real experts at the table.  On the
other hand, Elliotte Rusty Harold emits an 
<a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/7830">extended

(Sample: “I hope we can derail this completely...”)  Hey Elliotte,
I guess making friends and influencing people is for losers, right?
The proof of the pudding, obviously, is in the eating, but the fact that this
discussion is happening has to be a good thing.</p>

<h2 id='p-1'>Volume</h2>

<h2 id='p-2'>Issues</h2>
<p>As it says above, there are some.  First of all, I’m only counting the
number of subscribers to my Atom 1.0 feed, not my no-longer-present
permanently-redirected RSS feed.  I think the biggest sufferer is NetVibes,
which drops 354.</p>
<p>Second, several of the services, notably Google and NewsGator, report what
seem to be multiple different groups of subscribers to my Atom feed.   A few
of them are kind of understandable: two slashes instead of one,
<code>www.tbray.org</code> vs. <code>tbray.org</code>, and a few to
<code>/ongoing/ongoing.atom?foo=bar</code> (huh?); but for example Google,
which helpfully labels each group with a unique <code>feed-id</code>, suggests
that several different ones apply to
<code>http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/ongoing.atom</code>.  Beats me.  This may
lead to a little inaccuracy when adding up other multi-subscribers like
NewsGator; but wouldn’t change the ranking, I think.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Rah Rah Bloglines</h2>
<p>Apparently the programmers of Bloglines’ robots are the only ones who have
taken the trouble to read RFC2616 and RFC3986 (especially Section 6 of the
latter); they handle all the redirects and variations correctly and only know
about two ways to subscribe to me, the right one, and twenty subscribers to
that <code>?foo=bar</code> anomaly.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Unclear On The Concept</h2>
<p>There are a few people who’ve subscribed to URIs that don’t exist, or
aren’t feeds: <code>/ongoing/</code> itself, my <code>robots.txt</code>,
<code>ongoing.pie</code> (snicker), random pictures;
that’d be part of your Internet Background Radiation.</p>

<title>Dub, Baby</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>What happened was, I got a note from my friend
<a href="http://www.inthachamber.com/">Adam</a> 
“Vudu” (<a href="http://www.myspace.com/echodub">MySpace</a>) about his
new CD 
<a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/echomusic2">echo :: dubstyle</a>.
I have a soft spot for dub and liked the samples, so I hit the “Buy” button.
The record is good, a huge bargain at $12.97, go get it.  But the buying
experience was out of the ordinary.</p>
<img src="echo-dubstyle.png" alt="echo: dubstyle" class="inline" />
<h2 id='p-2'>The Music</h2>
<p>I understand there are people out there who don’t like dub; how
unfortunate.  This isn’t my favorite dub record—that would be <cite>Dub the
Rock</cite> by
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/09/23/IsraelVibration">Israel
Vibration</a>—but it’s a keeper.  It’s traditional, Adam’s not trying to push
back the edges of the medium.
There are some surprising bass tracks—that’s
his home instrument—plus he he works the soundstage well and keeps the textures
shifting, without ever losing that heavy dub lilt.</p>
<p>I was listening while writing, and track 8, <cite>Sidestep Dub</cite>,
yanked my attention away from the computer; it’s got some intelligent cool-electronica
punctuation and I was sad when it ended.</p>
<p>There are fourteen dubs here, then eight are offered again in “slowed”
(with a credit to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Screw">DJ Screw</a> for the notion)
versions.
I ain’t anywhere near hip enough to know about screwing or slowing, but eight
more dub tracks is a good thing.  I zeroed on on my fave <cite>Sideways
Dub</cite> and I like it both screwed and unscrewed.  This is a good
thing.</p>
<p>Like I said, a bargain.
(Potential purchasers should bear in mind that a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/03/02/Totem">serious subwoofer</a> will
enhance the listening experience.)</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Commerce</h2>
<p>The online purchase sequence at
<a href="http://cdbaby.com/">CD Baby</a>
doesn’t stand out in my memory, but a few
minutes later I got this email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subject: CD Baby Loves Tim</p>
<p>Tim -</p>
<p>Thanks for your order with CD Baby!</p>
<p>This is just a happy automated email to let you know a real person
will email you as soon as your package is sent, and you will also
receive a paper receipt with  your order in the mail.</p>
<p>Please save this email in case you have any questions about your
order.</p>
<p>** NOTE: if any of the info below looks wrong, please hit REPLY now
to let us know!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I liked the honesty about automated vs. personal email, and the notion
of encouraging you to mail back if something’s wrong; refreshing!</p>
<p>Then the next day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subject: CD Baby Loves Tim</p>
<p>Tim -</p>
<p>Thanks for your order with CD Baby!</p>
<p><i>[... details omitted ... ]</i></p>
<p>Your CD has been gently taken from our CD Baby shelves with
sterilized contamination-free gloves and placed onto a satin pillow.</p>
<p>A team of 50 employees inspected your CD and polished it to make sure
it was in the best possible condition before mailing.</p>
<p>Our packing specialist from Japan lit a candle and a hush fell over
the crowd as he put your CD into the finest gold-lined box that money
can buy.</p>
<p>We all had a wonderful celebration afterwards and the whole party
marched down the street to the post office where the entire town of
Portland waved 'Bon Voyage!' to your package, on its way to you, in
our private CD Baby jet on this day, Wednesday, January 31st.</p>
<p>I hope you had a wonderful time shopping at CD Baby.  We sure did.
Your picture is on our wall as 'Customer of the Year'.  We're all
exhausted but can't wait for you to come back to CDBABY.COM!!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, about the same day I got the disk, I got one more:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subject: CD Baby Loves Tim</p>
<p>Tim -</p>
<p>Did you get your CD OK?
Was everything perfect?</p>
<p>If you liked a CD you bought, please write a little review on the
musician's CD Baby page?  Just click the link below, and scroll to
the bottom of the page. You'll see where it says, "WRITE A REVIEW".
It only takes a minute and would mean a lot to the artists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, that’s what Internet commerce ought to be like: prompt, friendly, and
smart.</p>

<title>Old Map of the Future</title>

<body>
<p>I vaguely remember running across it a couple of times a dozen years ago or
more, described as an “experimental Web site”.
From time to time, when bored, I’d visit <a href="http://jodi.org">jodi.org</a>
and often my browser would end up toasted by flailing JavaScript <em>[Warning:
it can still happen]</em>.  I saw
some effects there for the first time that are now in every
AJAXian’s toolbox.</p>
<p>I totally can’t remember why, a few months ago, I looked again,
but their
<a href="http://map.jodi.org/">network map</a> captured my
imagination.  It’s kind of hard to describe; many
of the places on it are gone, and many that still exist don’t really need to.
Still, a little poking around may not be entirely
unrewarding.</p>
<p>While writing this, I made the mistake of visiting Wikipedia and found a
perfectly ordinary entry giving the who/what/where/when of jodi.org.  I
preferred it when I didn’t know any of those things.</p>

<title>Camera Blues</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Both my cameras are having problems so I’m grumpy; I’m cheering myself
up by watching the digicam market, appreciating what I have, and enjoying
flash photography.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the good stuff.  
Back in December I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/12/27/Christmas-Pictures#p-2">wrote</a> about
the joys of using a flash bounce-card.  It’s totally the single biggest step
forward in my camera technique in years.</p>
<img src="IMGP4658.jpg" alt="The seven lucky gods" />
<div class="caption"><p>The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Lucky_Gods">Seven Lucky Gods</a>,
a gift from
<a href="http://www.shimane-oss.org/">Open Source Shimane</a>.</p></div>
<p>For anyone who hasn’t figured this out yet, start doing it, it’s easy.  You
grab a piece of white paper and figure out a way to hold it up to the front of
your camera so that it bounces the light from the flash off to the side,
ideally against a not-too-distant reasonably-light-colored surface.
You could carry around a prepared piece of paper, but I just
use the nearest business card or envelope or whatever, and usually get good
results; in the picture above, a monthly bank statement.
The magic that makes it work is that digicams fire the flash twice, the
first time to set the meter; so it figures out how to compensate for whatever
weirdo lighting effect you’ve created.</p>
<p>Most of my interior shots are the kids so I won’t show them to you, which
is a pity because I’ve been getting perfect warm creamy flesh-tones almost
every time.</p>
<p>So I have a question; why don’t the cameras come with built-in
apparatus to do this automatically?  Most digicam flash pictures come out
bleached and glaring and awful.  For example, those Seven Lucky Gods have a
pretty pleasing colour balance to my eye; contrast the horrid lighting 
in 

<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/02/09/Shimane">the dinner-table photo</a>
of one of the visitors who brought them over;
for some reason I didn’t use a flash card.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Pocket Camera</h2>
<p>My darling
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/11/17/S70">Canon S70</a> is sick;
the zoom control sometimes zooms, sometimes doesn’t.  It’s been in my pocket
more or less every day since 2004, in some really inhospitable places; I’ve
used it on beaches and in rainstorms and prairie blizzards and dropped it a
couple of times.  It doesn’t look as bad as
<a href="http://photo.net/photodb/photo?photo_id=1046936">Willie Nelson’s
guitar</a>, but it doesn’t look good.
I guess I’ll try to get it repaired but I’m not that optimistic.</p>
<p>I have to say that, four years after
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/06/01/S50">getting into</a> this camera
format, I’m still in love with it.  It’s a pocket cam, it’ll do point-and-shoot
all right, but it’s a bit bigger, a bit fatter, has pretty extreme wide-angle
capabilities and as much manual control as you want to exercise.</p>
<p>Sure, other things being equal, the big Pentax DSLR is more flexible
and can capture a more beautiful image.  But other things are notably unequal, in
that the pocket cam is always there in my pocket when the beautiful image
occurs.</p>
<p>There’s a problem in that if the S70 is toast, it’s not obvious what to
replace it with.  The follow-on S80 has been well-reviewed, but doesn’t do
RAW.  Announced in 2005, it’s getting a little elderly and notably doesn’t
have image stabilization, which is basically the only really interesting new
digicam feature to have arrived in the last couple of years.</p>
<p>There’s not much else in the niche; Digital Photo Review, on which I rely
perhaps a little more than I should,
<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasoniclx2/">savaged the Panasonic
LX2</a>.  Hmm, I see that the about-to-arrive
<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0702/07022006_nikonp5000.asp">Nikon
P5000</a> is in a similar niche, and the
<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0608/06082103pentaxa20.asp">Pentax
A20</a> is also a candidate.  Also, I bet that there’ll be a Canon S90 pretty

<h2 id='p-2'>DSLR</h2>
<p>I haven’t regretted for a moment snapping up the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/05/16/PentaxDSLR">Pentax *ist D</a> in early 2005.
It’s been a complete joy to work with, and I still haven’t come close to
putting all the things it can do to work.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s some dust on the sensor now—you can only see it
against a flat background like sky or skin, and you can usually correct it
with Photoshop, but it’s really irritating—so something has to be done.  
Apparently, you 
<a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/visible-dust.shtml">can
sweep out
your camera’s innards yourself</a>, but I’m a little fumble-fingered and a lot
impatient and the notion makes me nervous.  Hmm, the *ist D’s owner’s manual
has detailed instructions, it doesn’t sound <em>that</em> hairy.</p>
<p>Gosh, I observe that the reviews on the
<a href="http://www.pentaximaging.com/products/product_details/digital_camera--*ist_DL/reqID--8793673/subsection--digital_slr">Pentax
K10D</a> are positively glowing.  Also that it has image stabilization.  Also
that it has a self-cleaning sensor.  Down, boy.</p>

<title>Fair Disclosure</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There’s a conversation going on about 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_FD">Regulation Fair Disclosure</a>.
Our own Jonathan Schwartz
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/one_small_step_for_the">kicked it
off  last October</a>, calling for Reg FD to be revised to allow the
use of the Web to publish material financial information.  
SEC Chairman Chris Cox surprised a lot of people by responding in a
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/sunlight_on_a_cloudy_day...">comment
on Jonathan’s blog</a> (I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/04/SEC">have a lot of time for Chairman
Cox</a>, but I was surprised too).
It turns out that there are
<a href="http://transparencymatters.blogspot.com/2006/11/bad-idea-for-issuers-and-for-investors.html">those
who don’t like the idea</a>.  This is a complicated issue that blends Web technology
with big-money business issues, and 
I’m interested in what the people who read <span class='o'>ongoing</span>
think; I suspect you include some of the people in the world most qualified to
have an opinion.
<i>[I suggest using the tag “WebFD” if you’re going to contribute in your own space.]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Disintermediation</h2>
<p>Assuming that Web disclosure were fair and accurate 
and timely, nobody could be against it, right?  Well, it
would be a classic case of disintermediation and thus threatening to
intermediaries, for example
<a href="http://home.businesswire.com/">BusinessWire</a>
and
<a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/">PR Newswire</a>.
They are in the business of collecting news releases from companies and
disseminating them to subscribers, who include journalists and the financial
community.
I don’t know how big a business it is.  Back when I was running a
startup, it was a couple of thousand dollars to do a press release, but big
companies usually have fixed-price annual deals; I’d assume Sun does.
I don’t know about the costs to subscribers.</p>
<p>Note that Mark Hynes, who wrote
<a href="http://transparencymatters.blogspot.com/2006/11/bad-idea-for-issuers-and-for-investors.html"> A bad idea for issuers and for investors</a>,
is in Investor Relations for PR Newswire.  Which doesn’t mean that his
arguments are wrong, it just means that he’s unlikely to be neutral; but then,
neither am I.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Cox: Be Careful</h2>
<p>Chairman Cox’s letter said “among the questions that would
need to be addressed is whether there exist effective means to guarantee that
a corporation uses its website in ways that assure broad non-exclusionary
access, and the extent to which a determination that particular methods are
effective in that regard depends on the particular facts.” 
Which I would translate as “We’d have to ensure that the disclosure is really
fair”, and I’d agree with fully.</p>
<p>Given that financial players can squeeze big-bucks advantages out of
getting their hands on hot financial info just a little bit ahead of the
market, and that there are powerful incentives to lie &amp; cheat &amp; steal for many
of the players in the system, both on the company side and the investor side,
this has to be done carefully.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Incumbent: Bad Idea</h2>
<p>PR Newswire’s Mr. Hynes
<a href="http://transparencymatters.blogspot.com/2006/11/bad-idea-for-issuers-and-for-investors.html">raises</a> ten potential problems,
saying that in the past, such ideas have been “shown to be unworkable, and
replaced with the tried and tested option of properly distributed press
releases serving the financial services community best.”  If you care about 
this, you should go his essay.
Speaking only for myself, I think some of his points are good and others
are bogus; I’ve addressed them below.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Accountability and the Market</h2>
<p>It seems that that if you were going to Web-enable Reg FD,
the key point would be accountability:
making it entirely clear that should the fairness or transparency of the
disclosure be compromised by a company’s web-site, or a
financial player’s use of it, the misbehaving party can be held
accountable.</p>
<p>Given that, unless there’s some awful technical flaw, why wouldn’t we give
it a try?  PR Newswire and BizWire argue strenuously that they can serve
companies and investors better.  If so, then the market will speak and both
sides will continue to choose their services, rather than using
the Web to bypass them.</p>
<p><i>[Disclosure: I’m biased; instinctively suspicious of
gatekeepers, intermediaries, and monopolies.  I’d really like the to do this
on the Web.  But Chairman Cox is right: we have to be careful.]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-5'>The Contra Position</h2>
<p>I’ll take the liberty of quoting Mark Hynes’ points in full and addressing
them one by one. (Here’s a chance for my expert commenters to point out why
I’m wrong.)
He opens with a question:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Why has the concept been found wanting? Here
are 10 reasons.</i></p>
<p><i>1. Push versus pull. A posting on a website requires investors
to proactively set up to receive the information. This has consequences such
as the institutional market (with greater resources to do this) being better
informed than retail, creating selective disclosure.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Everyone agrees that material releases would have
to happen at a pre-announced time.  If you cared about a large number of
companies that were releasing at the same moment, this might be a problem; but
for the typical retail investor, how hard can it be to watch a well-known
website at a well-known time?  I’d think that for the <em>retail</em>
investor, disintermediation would be a win.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>2. Formatting. No matter what format is loaded on to the
website, it will
inconvenience some part of the media and delivery chain, reducing the
visibility of news in the multitudes of media. The equity terminals are
notoriously inflexible in catching news from multiple, random sources. Reuters
et al are highly unlikely to redesign their entire editorial processes to
accommodate this notion.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>This is a hypothetical.  <em>If</em> the media are unwilling to go
gather news directly from company web-sites and can’t handle formats
like HTML and Atom, then presumably they’ll be happy to go on subscribing
to PR Newswire.  I can’t imagine retail investors worrying much.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>3. Validation/ editorial checking. There is well-substantiated evidence that show the number of occasions on which a release - fully approved by the company - has mistakes. 3rd party eyes and ears can help ensure that incorrect information does not reach the markets.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>This is an excellent point; speaking as one with long-time experience in
reference publishing, I’m aware of the fact that you keep turning up
significant errors even after multiple proof-reading passes; and an error in a
material financial release could really hurt.
Of course, at the end of the day, the accountability for errors has to be with
the originator of the information.  Still, assuming that PR Newswire’s
customers find value in this, it should be decoupled from the
information-pump function and offered as a separate service.  I suspect that it
would be of significant value to many companies.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>4. Security of posting. Is the person posting the release on the issuer's website entitled to do so? Would every company have to create restricted zones for IR, corporate secretary etc?</i></p></blockquote>
<p>This seems entirely bogus to me.  Is the person sending the release to PR
Newswire entitled to do so?  Doesn’t every company currently have to create special
press-releasing roles for IR, corporate secretary etc?   Of course.  Plus, any
reasonably well-managed company already has some sort of access-control
protocol in place for its website; I guarantee that I wouldn’t be allowed to
update Sun’s
<a href="http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/investor/index.jsp">Investor
Relations</a> page.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>5. Role of financial PR companies. Financial PR companies post large numbers of results releases to the newswires. Would every company expect to give the PR companies access to the (secure) area of their website?</i></p></blockquote>
<p>I think it’s worth the experiment of giving companies the option (remember,
we’re talking about an option, not a compulsory mandate) of posting their own
numbers without going through a PR company.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>6. Down time. No single source can be relied upon 100% - the newswires have (had to) invest in redundancy of systems, ensuring permanent access. Not every company will have the resources to do this, and smaller caps are especially vulnerable.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>This is another good point; lots of companies’ websites are mostly
brochure-ware and don’t have the kind of redundancy that the CFO 
would require.  Others do.  Those who need help present another
business opportunity for experts such as PR Newswire and BizWire.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>7. Access to the 'editorial process'. Journalists work in many different ways, some on email, some using newswires, some on fax etc, with a constantly moving population. It is unreasonable to expect all companies to keep up to date with journalist changes, or to develop multiple mechanisms to deliver to these different audiences. And expecting investors and journalists to re-register is frankly unrealistic.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>In my experience, almost all unsolicited press releases are simply ignored
by almost all journalists.  Those that really matter—for example, financial
results from public companies—are actively sought out by those who
cover the companies.  
I see no reason why a journalist covering a
particular release would care much whether they’re getting it from a company’s
website or the current intermediaries.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>8. New media types are constantly emerging - it is in the commercial interests of the newswire to constantly patrol for these media, and harness them. Would all quoted companies be as diligent?</i></p></blockquote>
<p>What Mr. Hynes
is discussing here is either journalism—proactively going after a story—or
feed filtering such as is now provided by Technorati and its competitors.  I
don’t see what either has to do with material financial disclosures; for those,
Reg FD makes it clear that it’s the responsibility of the company to
ensure proactively that these be available, timely and fair.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>9. Simultaneity. The principles of good disclosure - never mind the law of the land - requires news to be accessible to all investors at the same time. This would be impossible for companies to achieve.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>This is Mr. Hynes’ single best point, I think.   I don’t know enough to
know whether he’s right, but I bet somebody who reads this does.
What are the service-level guarantees that the incumbents provide?  For
example, when HPQ’s quarterlies cross the wires, if I’m a stock-market dabbler
on DSL in Bend, Oregon, how many microseconds is the lag between the time when a
Goldman Sachs trader sees them and I do?  The maximum tolerable lag between
Goldman Sachs and Bear Stearns?</p>
<p>Given a clean definition of the acceptable information
latencies, it’ll be an interesting question how well the Web can do.  It might
not be good enough to just post the release on the corporate server in Mountain View
or Raleigh or wherever, there might be a case for Akamai-style
infrastructure.</p>
<p>It also dawns on me that when you get the quarterlies, the real-world
latency is the time it takes you to plow through all the earnest corporate
bumph at the top and get to the actual numbers that are actionable for you.
To reduce it, the smart thing to do is to start sending the data in XML so
that you can pre-program your computer to show you what you care about in a
fraction of a second.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>10. These challenges will inevitably hurt smaller companies most, a) by increasing cost to enhance their websites to the necessary degree, and b) investors will access large companies first; an investment story from a smaller company will win less prominence, ultimately strangling some prematurely, due to less access to capital.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>I’m sorry, but absent the evidence, the above are just
unsupported assertions.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>My View</h2>
<p>I suspect delivering financials to investors is a
corporate function that will probably end up being largely outsourced, as it
is today.  Now is the time to try basing this delivery
on open Web infrastructure rather than the proprietary pipes of a few
incumbent gatekeepers.  That way there’s room for 
competition, and thus improved business performance, at both ends of the
pipe.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>What Do You Think?</h2>
<p>This dialogue is now in progress.  On the evidence, both the corporate and
government sides of it are listening.   If we can figure out how to make the
Web do what companies and investors need, I think there’s a chance to remove
some friction from the investment economy.</p>

<body>
<p>Today we announced something, and let’s stick with the code-name “Neptune”
because officially it’s called the
<a href="http://www.sun.com/products/networking/ethernet/10gigethernet/">Sun x8 Express Dual 10 Gigabit Ethernet Fiber XFP Low Profile Adapter</a>,
which just rolls off the tongue, doesn’t it.   I have to say it’s about the
butchiest-looking NIC I’ve ever seen.
Now, normally I would have bypassed the opportunity to blog, because I’ve never
actually even seen a 10G wire or plug, and have no idea what the trade-offs
are and what makes a good one.  But our Ariel Hendel wrote
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/hendel/entry/russian_dolls">Russian Dolls</a>,
the first paragraph of which discusses love, soccer, and beer, and which includes
a remarkable photograph; it is actually about Neptune.  Speaking as a geek who likes
fast networks and good writing, I think it’s wonderful.</p>

<title>Comment Updates</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>When I first threw the switch and opened the <span class='o'>ongoing</span>
space to contributors, my Atom feed included comment counts.
Thus, every time someone commented, subscribers saw the
article again in their feed-readers.  This was unpopular (check out the discussion 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/06/On-Comments">here</a> and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/08/On-Comments">here</a>) so I removed them. 
But now I’m unhappy with that decision.</p>
<p>The trouble is, I know that very few people subscribe to my
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/comments.atom">comments feed</a>, and I
also know that for quite a few of the fragments here, if you cared enough
about the subject to read the original, you really <em>really</em> want to go
back and read the comments too, because individually or in sum, they outweigh my
contribution.</p>
<p>For example, if you care about trends in high-end pocket cameras, the
comments on
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/02/19/Camera-Blues">Camera Blues</a> are a
treasure trove.  And if you care about the future of XML, the discussion on
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/01/30/XML-2">XML 2.0?</a> is essential.</p>
<p>It’s also troubling that I advertise my Atom feed as “full-content” but
it’s really not, because it omits the—essential, in my opinion—contributions
from others.</p>
<p>Last time the discussion came up, people felt that I ought to perform an
editorial function; update the article when I thought there were particularly
insightful comments that were especially noteworthy.  Nope, doesn’t scale.
First of all, the writing I do here consumes pretty well all the available
cycles and second, I’d end up doing it for almost every piece.</p>
<p>So, as a compromise between what I want and what my audience wants, I think
I’m going to start flagging the comments in the feed; but only once every
other day, and I’ll skip the first day.
Since the commenting, even when it’s voluminous, is usually over with quick,
on average you’ll only see each article twice in your feed-reader.</p>
<p>So, what should I put in the feed?  I see three options:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Just the number of comments.</p></li>
<li><p>The full text of all the comments; then the feed would <em>really</em>
be “full-content”.</p></li>
<li><p>Update the comment form to accept an optional “summary” field, and
include that in the feed.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Simpler is better, so I tend to lean to #2.  What do you think?</p>
<p><i>[Update:]</i> I think that the first comment below points at the right
answer, so I just added another comment outlining what I think I’ll do.</p>

<title>More Economist Trouble</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>You know, if I didn’t care so much about 
<a href="http://www.economist.com">The Economist</a>, I wouldn’t be
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/13/Economist-QA">giving it grief</a>
here.  If the word “journalism” means anything, it should mean
<em>quality</em>; I expect that my (expensive) subscription buys me a magazine
that I often expect to disagree with but which is thoughtful, well-researched,
well-written, and well-edited.  I don’t <em>want</em> to abandon journalism,
but these guys are dropping their end of the bargain.</p>
<p>A recent
<a href="http://www.economist.com/surveys/displayStory.cfm?story_id=8513949">Survey on Executive Pay</a> (that’s a subscriber-only link), 
dives at length, and with details, into the perceived abuse of shareholders by
executives, points out the keenest abuses and (this being <cite>The
Economist</cite>) offers some arguments as to why
this might not be as bad as it looks.</p>
<p>Some of them are sort of coherent, but then you get this: “The role of pay
is not to get executives to work harder (most are workaholics already, toiling
towards an appointment with the heart surgeon), but to recruit good managers
and get them to take difficult decisions. Shutting a subsidiary, sacrificing a
pet project or forgoing a tempting acquisition is not much fun. Without the
spur of high pay, managers tend to avoid such things.”  Uh, evidence, please?  Even
<em>anecdotal</em> evidence?  This is kind of the center of the whole
argument, and there’s no there there.</p>
<p>Next, for your amusement, is the following advertisement taken from the
current issue’s right-up-front “Executive Focus” section, which is mostly
recruiting for high-level jobs (it shares a page with ads from the UN and Save the
Children).</p>
<img src="e-ms.jpg" alt="Microsoft ad from the Economist" />
<p>To start with, it’s in the wrong place in the magazine.  
And this
Microsoft “People Ready” campaign is pathetically awful, into brain-damage
territory. 
Ah, but editorial and advertising are different parts of the shop, right?
That might be true, except for
the ad clearly suggests that <cite>The Economist</cite> has
bought into this “people-ready” vapidity and is writing articles about it.
Not so, fortunately; if you follow the link, the page you end up
at is regurgitated <cite>Economist</cite> articles from the last few years, not
particularly interesting, in a dense frame of Microsoft ads.
And finally, they can’t spell “its”.</p>
<p>Really, really, offensive.</p>
<p>Dear <cite>Economist</cite>:  I don’t buy your beautifully-typeset dead trees
and steal whatever time it takes to read most of each issue, and put up with
your knee-jerk right-wing thought filters, to be presented with this kind of crap.
If I want unsupported assertions, lame-ass Microsoft marketing, and lousy
spelling, I have the whole Internet to choose from.  You need to be better.</p>

<title>Moose Camp</title>

<body>
<p>This is the one-day Unconference that happens the day before
<a href="http://2007.northernvoice.ca/">Northern Voice</a>. Unfortunately I
missed Northern Voice, due to a combination of a child’s soccer game and a
vicious one-day ailment of some sort that knocked me completely on my butt for
24 hours.  Anyhow,
<a href="http://wiki.northernvoice.ca/Moosecamp2007">Moose Camp</a> was 100%
excellent.  It irritates me that I went through the first forty-something
years of my life without having had the Unconference experience.</p>
<p>All these pictures are (I think) from the
<a href="http://wiki.northernvoice.ca/New%20Rules%20for%20the%20New%20Communities">New

<p>That session was good fun, basically just an open-ended discussion about
what life in online communities is like, and how it could be better.  Like
every other Moose Camp session I went to, it could easily have been two or
three times as long.</p>
<p>There was this guy in the back row and right in the belly of this long and
fairly earnest discussion of the community experience, he put up his hand and said
“By the way, I can get you really cheap Viagra and Cialis.”  It was the best
kind of humor; quite a few of us had a moment of “Can he
mean it?!” shock before the room exploded in laughter.</p>

<title>OpenID</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The buzz around OpenID is becoming impossible to ignore.  If you don’t know
why, check out 
<a href="http://simonwillison.net/2006/openid-screencast/">How To Use
OpenID</a>, a
screencast by Simon Willison.
As it’s used now (unless I’m missing something) OpenID seems pretty
useless, but with only a little work (unless I’m missing something) it
could be very useful indeed.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Problem: TLS</h2>
<p>The first problem is that OpenID doesn’t require the use of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a>
(what’s behind URIs that begin with <code>https:</code>).  Doing anything
remotely connected with authentication over an unencrypted link where you
can’t be sure who you’re talking to seems all wrong to me.
I see that this subject is under discussion (<a href="http://jyte.com/cl/openid-providers-should-use-tls-whenever-possible">here</a>
and
<a href="http://lists.danga.com/pipermail/yadis/2005-July/001273.html">here</a>)
in the community.</p>
<p>The fact that apparently-sane people think it might
sometimes be OK to not use TLS makes me think there’s something obvious I’m
missing.  In Simon’s screencast, the pages that you type your OpenID into are
unsecured; hmmm.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Problem: What’s It Mean?</h2>
<p>Another problem with OpenID is that, well, having one doesn’t mean very
much; just that you can verify that some server somewhere says it believes that the
person operating the browser owns that ID.</p>
<p>Unless I’m missing something, as a thought experiment I could set up a
bogus OpenID server at <code>http://www.tbray.org/silly-id/</code>, and
arrange that when queried about any OpenID whatsoever beginning with that URI,
it instantly provided a positive response.  For example,
<code>http://www.tbray.org/silly-id/BillGates</code> or
<code>http://www.tbray.org/sill-id/PopeBenedictXVI</code>.  None of that nasty
time-consuming authentication stuff; sure would speed up logging into
OpenID-supporting sites.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Problem: Phishing</h2>
<p>This is going to be a problem, but I don’t think it’s fair to hang it on
OpenID, because it’s going to be equally a problem with <em>any</em>
browser-based authentication.  Since browser-based authentication is What The
People Want, we’re just going to have to fight through this with a combination of
browser engineering and (more important) educating the general public.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>What Could I Use It For Today?</h2>
<p>Here’s what I think I’d be willing to do: in the commenting system here at
<span class='o'>ongoing</span>, I’d be inclined, if I had manually approved a
comment with someone who’d authenticated via OpenID, to subsequently accept
further comments from that OpenID, unmoderated.</p>
<p>I can’t think of anything else.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Solution: TLS</h2>
<p>Just Do It.  Create a culture where traffic is simply expected to be
encrypted and secure for each step in the authentication chain.  If there’s
anything in the protocol that makes this hard, fix it.  Yes, anyone
offering authentication services will have to own and manage a cert.  That is
the entry-level price for me taking you seriously.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Solution: Meaning Something</h2>
<p>I haven’t actually heard anyone argue that all OpenIDs should be considered
equal to all others, which is good, because that would be a profoundly silly
idea.</p>
<p>For some given application, I might be willing to support LiveJournal
OpenIDs but not those from MyOpenID; or vice versa.  There might be an
opportunity for some sort of independent-security-audit business, rating
quality of OpenID providers.  Bruce Schneier, where are you?</p>
<p>Once again, maybe I’m missing something, but it seems obvious that if
OpenID is ever going to be much use for real work in applications that
matters, there are going to be whitelists of ID Providers.  Does anyone see
this as a problem?  If not, all the libraries out there Ruby and Python and
PHP and so on need to have the provider-whitelist feature built in.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>The Real Problem</h2>
<p>Of course, out there in the enterprise space where most of Sun’s customers
live, they think about identity problems at an entirely different level.
Single-sign-on seems like a little and not terribly interesting piece of the
problem.  They lose sleep at night over “Attribute Exchange”; once you have an
identity, who is allowed to hold what pieces of information about you, and
what are the right protocols by which they may be requested, authorized, and
delivered?  The technology is tough, but the policy issues are
mind-boggling.</p>  
<p>So at the moment I suspect that OpenID isn’t that interesting to those
people.   But Web-heads like me care about Plain Old Single Sign-on, and we
like identifying ourselves by URI.  So OpenID might scratch a pretty big
itch.</p>
<p>Unless I’m missing something.  The reason I keep saying that is that I
really am an Identity newbie.  I’m sure my commenters will be diligent in
pointing out where I’ve gone off the rails.</p>

<title>Advertising</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I spend a mainstream amount of time reading magazines and watching TV, and
a more-than-mainstream amount reading the Net.  Of all the
teeming billions of dollars poured into advertising on all these media, essentially none
of it speaks to me.  This was brought home yesterday when I was impressed by two
ads in one day.  They were running this TV ad for Subway (the sandwich shop)
that was just incredibly simple and linear: “Unlike
McDonalds and the others, we make our bread fresh every day in the store”;
with a picture of the oven.  I
haven’t been to a Subway in decades, but the next time I’ve got hungry cranky
kids to wrangle, that’s maybe a good argument for giving them a try.
The same evening, I was looking through my newsfeeds, and in 
<cite>The Economist’s</cite> excellent
<a href="http://www.economist.com/debate/freeexchange/">Free Exchange</a> blog
(yeah, dust off your knee-jerk right-silliness filter, but still) feed, one of the
entries was an ad; a simple one-paragraph squib saying there was a special
offer for new subscribers.  I already subscribe, but you couldn’t
imagine a better way to pitch a subscription.  Two in one day?  That’s the
first time that’s happened in years.</p>

<title>Photo Camp and High-End Compacts</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>At Northern Voice, one of the best sessions was the 
<a href="http://wiki.northernvoice.ca/PhotoCamp">Photo Camp</a>; the only
problem was that, at ninety minutes, it was way too short.  I did a
little presentation on the state of the high-end-compact market (summarized
below), but as usually happens at an Unconference, I learned more than I taught.</p>
<p>There was a lot of talk on workflow, something that is increasingly
becoming an issue for your average digicam hobbyist.
In particular,
<a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/">Roland Tanglao</a> gave a presentation
on Adobe Lightroom, and Adobe ought to put that boy on commission, because I
bet fifty people are going to buy it.  That would include me.</p>
<p>Big thanks to
<a href="http://www.kriskrug.com/">Kris Krug</a> for pulling it together.</p>
<p><i>[Note to anyone who’s ended up here via search: This was posted in
February 2007, and its contents are probably limited in usefulness to a few
months following that date.]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Compacts</h2>
<p>As I wrote recently in
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/02/19/Camera-Blues">Camera Blues</a>, my
my workhorse Canon S70 is dying, and I’m thinking about replacing it.  There
were a ton of smart comments there and I ended up gathering up enough
information to want to share it.</p>
<p>I think it’s terribly important, if you care about pictures at all, to
always have a camera at hand.  You can agonize forever about composition and white
balance and post-processing, but the single most important factor in getting a
good picture is having a camera when the good-picture opportunity occurs.
For most of us, in particular those who aren’t professionals, an SLR is just
too big and too heavy to want to carry it around all the time; my nice Pentax
DSLR comes out with me when I have pictures in mind; but most of my best
pictures are taken at other times.
So some kind of pocket camera is really essential.</p>
<p>There are really two options in a pocket camera: you go small or you go
ambitious. 
For example, 
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren</a> uses a 
<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/specs/Canon/canon_sd400.asp">Canon
SD400</a>, it’s amazingly small and looks like a jewel; and it takes good
pictures.
Why would you want anything else?  The high-end compacts are
bigger and bulkier and might not even 
work as a pocket cam for a smaller person dressed for a warmer climate (the
SD400 would work anywhere but a nudist colony).</p>
<p>The high-end cameras do have some advantages.  To compensate for
the extra pocket strain, they’re often kind of butchy-looking, often in black
rather than silver.  This gives your photographic subjects the feeling that
this is An Important Picture.</p>
<p>But I digress.  With a high-end model, you can expect it to shoot a wider
angle, to have a bigger zoom range, and to have fine control over lots
of settings, usually via buttons on the outside rather than going through a
menu.  A side-effect is that the back and sides of these models are richly
festooned with buttons.</p>
<p>And historically, high-end compacts have supported shooting in RAW.  The
current generation seems to be backing away from this; speculation is that
they’re worried about cannibalizing sales of DSLRs.
This seems silly, since there’s a high overlap between the owners of high-end
compacts and DSLRs.</p>
<p>As I discuss these cameras, the observant will notice that a <em>lot</em>
of the pointers are into
<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/">Digital Photography Review (DPR)</a>;
this is hard to avoid because they have stats on every camera known to
humankind, and detailed reviews of a high proportion.  I tend to put quite a
bit of weight on their reviews, because they are free with criticism when they
find problems.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Past</h2>
<p>I’ve been carrying the
<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/specs/Canon/canon_s70.asp">Canon
S70</a> since late 2004; at that time, it coupled the widest-available angle
in a pocket cam with unusually long zoom, as much manual control as you
wanted, and could shoot RAW.</p>
<p>It’s met my needs; unless I can get the zoom fixed, this will probably be
the last time it’s featured on <span class='o'>ongoing</span>.  Sunset at
SFO.</p>
<img src="IMG_5305.jpg" alt="Sunset at SFO" />
<h2 id='p-3'>The Future</h2>
<p>Searching for a replacement has not been entirely satisfying.</p>
<p>First, as I noted, the camera builders have been subtracting RAW support.
It escapes me how subtracting features from a high-tech consumer product can
ever be a good idea.  Second, a few of them are still in the grip of the
more-megapixels-is-better mania.  It’s hard to blame them, given that that’s
always the number that gets featured in the Best Buy flyers; but still, at
this moment in early 2007, in the compact form factor, a 7MP camera is less
apt to have noise and distortion problems than a 10MP model.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is one very compelling new feature in the
digicam world: anti-shake.  In practical terms, this considerably expands the
range of conditions you can shoot in without using a flash, and you’ll get some
shots you just wouldn’t have, before.</p>
<p>Having said all that, let’s look at some of the options.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Canon S80</h2>
<p>Since I’ve been happy with the S70,
<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/specs/Canon/canon_s80.asp">its successor</a> 
would be a logical choice.  Trouble is, it’s two years old now (has Canon
dropped this line of cameras?), doesn’t do RAW, and doesn’t have anti-shake.
So I think it’s not that interesting.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Canon G7</h2>
<p>I had missed the
<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/specs/Canon/canon_g7.asp">G7</a> in
my initial sweep, because for some reason I didn’t think it was a compact,
but one of the Photo Camp attendees pulled hers out for us to look at.
Anti-shake yes, RAW no.  DPR thinks it fell short, but I think I’ll have to
take a closer look.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Canon A710 IS</h2>
<p>This one isn’t actually in the “high-end” category, but it was recommended
by a few of the commenters on my <cite>Camera Blues</cite> piece.  As I poke
around the Internet, I have to say that there’s a lot to like about the
<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/specs/Canon/canon_a710is.asp">A710
IS</a>.
It does anti-shake but not RAW, it’s light, it’s flexible, it’s cheap, it’s
only 7 MP.
Check out
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jgraham/">jgraham’s pictures</a> over at
Flickr; he/she is getting excellent results with this camera.</p>
<p>If none of the ostensibly high-end cameras are going to make me happy, I
suspect that this puppy would take me most of the way there and save money too.</p>
<h2 id='p-11'>Panasonic LX2</h2>
<p>Formally known as the
<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/specs/Panasonic/panasonic_dmclx2.asp">
Lumix LX2</a>; there’s a lot to like about this, on paper.  It’s got a Leica lens, a
16:9 aspect ratio, antishake, and shoots RAW.  Unfortunately, DPR thinks (and
is pretty convincing on the subject) that they muffed the job of squeezing in
the 10MP, so there are serious noise issues.  Sigh.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>Pentax A20</h2>
<p>I have a big soft spot for Pentax, it’s what my
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Dad</a> always carried and our
DSLR is a Pentax.</p>
<p>The
<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/specs/Pentax/pentax_optioa20.asp">A20</a>
is kind of in the same territory as the A710; anti-shake but no RAW, a little
less expensive, very decent specs.  I’ll have to have a closer look.</p>
<p>All the cameras mentioned thus far have been out for a while, you can go to
your friendly local camera store and buy one.  It turns out that we’re only
weeks away from
<a href="http://www.pmai.org/pma07/">PMA 2007</a>, the world’s biggest camera
trade-fair, so the new-product announcements are coming thick and fast.  Here
are a few that look interesting.</p>
<h2 id='p-8'>Sigma DP1</h2>
<p>This is a weird one, as you might expect; Sigma is mostly in the lens
business, and their cameras tend to be idiosyncratic.  Among other things,
they use the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foveon_X3_sensor">Foveon</a> sensor,
which is radically different from the model used in almost all other
Digicams.  Think of this as the camera equivalent of Mazda’s rotary
engine.</p>
<p>There’s not that much known about the 
<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0609/06092604sigmadp1.asp">DP1</a>; It
<a href="http://www.sigma-photo.com/news/news.asp?nID=3281">does exist</a> on
the company’s website, but without much detail.  It does shoot RAW, but I
don’t see anything about antishake.  Here’s the weird thing: it’s not a zoom.
It has a fixed lens said to be to 28mm-equivalent.  Assuming it’s not
vaporware, I’m going to have a close look at this; I appreciate
people who have the courage to point in a direction different from that the
mainstream market is facing.</p>
<h2 id='p-9'>Pentax A30</h2>
<p>This look like an update to the A20 mentioned above.  Antishake yes, RAW
no, sigh.  In fact, the
<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0702/07022104pentaxa30.asp">A30</a>
differs only in having a larger CCD (which is good), and in being black.</p>
<h2 id='p-10'>Nikon P5000</h2>
<p>This one is either a stand-out or they have an effective PR organization;
the announcement was covered at <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/02/19/nikons-p5000-10-megapixel-prosumer-cam/">Engadget</a>
as well as <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0702/07022006_nikonp5000.asp">DPR</a>.</p>
<p>The features and specs and design all look decent to me.  I poked around
the Nikon site and there was lots of publicity, all silent on the subject of
whether it will shoot RAW.  
Maybe the ball is still in play and some moronic
Strategic Product Manager in the DSLR group is trying to get that feature subtracted.
One of the commenters at Engadget said “Yes, it will have RAW” which is
probably not conclusive.</p>
<p>The site is total Flash hell so I can’t actually point to the camera (uh,
Nikon marketing, get a clue), but if you start
<a href="http://www.nikondigital.com/main.html">here</a> you can get there.</p>
<h2 id='p-12'>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Maybe I’ll have to learn to live without RAW.  Aside from that, nothing yet.  I’ll be shopping and I’ll report back.</p>

<title>Camino 1.1β</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I gave it a try, and now I’m switched over.  Camino is a Mac browser that’s
based on the Mozilla Gecko engine, but doesn’t use the Firefox XUL front-end.
Previously, I used Camino 1.0
as my main everyday browser because it was the only one that felt like it
belonged on the Mac, was acceptably fast, and didn’t periodically balloon out
of control.  (Yes, I use Firefox too for its developer tools.)  The 1.1
beta has fixes for pretty well all the things that irritated me about 1.0: it
saves your tabs in case you crash, text-edit controls now support the
control-F/B/N/P/A/E idiom just like everything else, and resize-to-fit works
properly.  I think that for almost any Mac user who spends a lot of time in
the browser,
<a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/">Camino</a> would be worth a serious
look.</p>

<title>Another Blow to Emacs</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’ve been watching
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/tor/">Tor Norbye</a> grinding away on NetBeans
6, and couldn’t wait any more, so I went and downloaded a
<a href="http://www.netbeans.info/downloads/dev.php">daily build</a>, and it
seems to kinda work.  Up till now, all my Ruby work has been in Emacs, but
the NB6 pre-pre-alpha trumps it.</p>
<img src="projects.png" alt="NB 6 dev build Projects read-out" />
<p>One thing that impresses me in the project read-out above is that it’s
picked up the CVS check-in status of all the files in the Ape project.</p>
<p>Mind you, pre-alpha code does have some issues; I had to restart NetBeans a
half-dozen times to get the Ruby modules out of the update center and into
action.
Also, if you go get NB6, particularly for Ruby work, here’s some advice: start
it up, then go for a cup of coffee while it indexes the Java universe.  Then,
when you first open a Ruby project, go get another cup of coffee; pre-indexing
Ruby takes longer than Java. <i>[Update: Just to be clear, this is only the
first time you run NB.]</i></p>
<p>I hit another bug; upon first start-up, it asked me if I wanted to import
my NB5 settings and promptly crashed when I said “yes”.  This actually
led to a pleasant surprise: I noticed that NB was supporting the Emacs
control-F/B/N/P/A/E keystrokes apparently out of the box.</p>
<p>The core editing window has a bunch of improvements; the one I liked was
that when you’ve got a syntax error, there’s a little doohickey in the margin
that you mouse over to get the details, as opposed to the whole line being
“hot”.</p>
<p>Here’s a sample of the syntax highlighting.  I’m not sure I agree 100% with
all the choices, but it’s sure easy to read.  This is the function for fishing
links out of Atom entries.</p>
<img src="link-code.png" alt="Code for Ape::Entry#link" />
<p>The NB toolbar is ridiculously cluttered and busy; who needs a button for
“Open File” anyhow?  I whacked it back to the minimum, and since I use the
hide-and-reveal-on-mouse-over for the Projects, Files, Runtime, and Navigator
windows, my NB is a lean, mean coding machine.</p>
<p>I’ve run across a few bugs in the more advanced features, haven’t got
around to filing them yet.   There was one indentation bug that seemed really
moronic so I emailed the file to Tor and said “Guess I should file this,
right?” and he wrote back “I did, and the fix is in the Update Center.”
So if you’re interested in alternate editing environments for Ruby, right now
seems like a good time to shake this one down and feed back on it.</p>
<p>NB6 seems awfully solid for something that’s not even advertised as an
alpha yet.  I don’t know when they’re thinking of shipping.  Next time I do
some Java tinkering I’ll give NB6 a try and report back.  In the meantime,
Emacs has lost its grip on my Ape and Blog-Commenting projects.</p>

<title>Udell and Vinoski</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I almost never listen to podcasts.  I don’t commute, and just sitting in
front of my computer, I tend to get distracted.  But I did manage to hang in
through all but the trailing couple of minutes of Jon Udell’s
<a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2007/02/23/a-conversation-with-steve-vinoski-about-services-the-enterprise-and-the-web/">A conversation with Steve Vinoski about services, the enterprise, and the web</a>.
Since I’m called out by name, I think I should probably respond.</p>
<p>Jon dominates this conversation, and he has an agenda: the REST vs. WS-*
dispute is pointless, there are places for both
approaches, and Why Can’t We All Just Get Along?  Steve is mostly ready to agree,
but the discussion visits some useful and interesting places as they
toss it back and forth.
Steve is regretful that in the early days of WS-* a lot of
the people involved didn’t really understand the Web.  He points to
<a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis2/">Apache Axis2</a> (which actually I
hadn’t been watching) as “the awakening of the enterprise crowd to the Web”.
Interesting stuff.</p>
<p>I’m portrayed as the black-clad anarchist. Jon: “Tim Bray, for example, you
know, you get the impression from Tim, ‘Let’s just tear the whole thing down,
it was a complete waste of time.’”
Uh, not so much.  If you want to know what I think, read Pete
Lacey’s
<a href="http://wanderingbarque.com/nonintersecting/2007/01/14/it-is-hard-to-be-a-dove/">It is Hard to be a Dove</a>
and my own
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/02/04/WS-Microsoft">SOA and WCF</a>.</p>
<p>To wit: Don’t use WS-* unless you need to interoperate with existing WS-*
deployments, in particular Microsoft WCF, which is the twenty-first century
version of DCOM: the Windows network API they’d like you to program
to.</p>
<p>So, no, I don’t want to tear anything down, but I also don’t want to just
get along: I want to start building developer tooling
around REST, or what Greg Papadopoulos calls RSWS: “Real Simple Web
Services”.  I think work to date on WS-* represents a sunk investment; use it
when you have to (we at Sun are shipping the tooling to let Javaland talk to
WCF) but not as the basis for anything new.  Because the design of WS-* just
has
<a href="http://wanderingbarque.com/nonintersecting/2006/11/15/the-s-stands-for-simple/">too many problems</a> 
to be suitable for enterprise use, in the general case.</p>
<p>Jon presents the WS-* party line that REST is all well and good when you’re
doing simple point-to-point stuff; but when you have sophisticated policy-based
security that you need to manage across a network fabric rich with
intermediaries, you need more, and that’s what WS-* is for.</p>
<p>Well yes, except for that kind of policy-driven intermediary-rich
environment remains, more or less, science fiction; I personally have never
observed such a thing actually working, and I have little faith that the WS-*
theorists, meeting in their invitation-only back rooms, cooking up and 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/10/23/WS-Funnies">superseding</a> specs, are
going to get it right first time based on zero real-world experience.
Particularly with an abomination like WSDL in at the very core.</p>
<p>Hey Jon, our criticisms of WS-* are specific and have to do with issues of
process and stability and technical quality and a demonstrated lack of
interoperability.  It is <em>badly-engineered technology</em>, using it will
increase the likelihood that your project fails, and 
it is not suitable for use by conscientious IT professionals.</p>
<p>Unless you need to talk to <s>DCOM 2006</s> WCF.</p>

<h2 id='p-1'>Jonathan and the Ricoh</h2>
<p>Probably the most
interesting part of the conversation was
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/02/25/High-End-Compact-Cameras#c1172486524.744665">a
paean</a> to the

hit home pretty hard with me because it’s by
<a href="http://weblog.delacour.net/">Jonathan Delacour</a> who is only like
my favorite photoblogger in the whole world, or he was until he went quiet in
2005.</p>
<p>Even though he taught me the word
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh">bokeh</a>, he didn’t quite
convince me... since I’m a computer geek (lots of inside 
shots) living in the Pacific Northwest (sunshine? what’s that), low-light
performance matters really a lot to me, and I don’t have any sentimental
attachment to “the most gorgeous pushed film-grain” as a look, I want to
approximate what my eyes report to the brain.</p>
<p>Jonathan also sneered expressively at

yet.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Camera Store</h2>
<p>I dropped by a big-box camera store the other day and now I know why I
didn’t include the Canon G7 in my original survey, it’s just way too damn big,
not a pocket camera for anyone under NBA size.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Canon 710 IS looked just about right, if I hadn’t
been so
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/03/05/Still-Sick">sick</a> at the time I
probably would have grabbed it.  Gotta have something in my pocket if only as

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza">The flu</a> is a funny
disease, all over the map; I’m in my ninth day and still far from 100%.
Partly that’s because on her sixth day, Lauren suddenly got markedly worse and
was desperately ill in bed, so I ran the house and kids and everything
all weekend in a weakened condition.</p>
<p>Blogging becomes ephemeral when you have
sleep deprivation and a sick wife and a  normal healthy attention-hungry
9-month-old.
(The seven-year old son has been wonderful, pitching in where he can and
accepting that there are times when he’s just gonna have to amuse himself;  I
owe him.)
At work, I’m doing the telecons and correspondence and form-filling that have
to be done, but they’re taking all my attention when I work on them and when I
finish one I stand up and walk away from the computer or phone or desk.  
And when the kids are
in bed I sit up long enough to get centred and maybe read a few words on paper
then I go to bed too.</p>
<p>On top of which this Worst Winter Ever isn’t done yet, every day is another
sneer at Spring; grey and cold and early dimness and rain pounding in
the roof; a couple of my sickest mornings there was snow on the ground, looked
just like it felt inside my chest.</p>
<p>After supper yesterday I was nearly gibbering with exhaustion and had the
TV on so the boy could watch the hockey while I did his lunch for school and
something for Lauren to try to eat and straightened the kitchen and kept the
baby cheery.  I walked by and the hockey was boring so I grabbed the remote
and the first click turned up Mark Knopfler and Emmylou Harris on PBS, doing
an <cite>All the Roadrunning</cite> set, I left it there and stopped by
when I could.  Awfully pretty, wonderfully well-played, no surprises.</p>
<p>I even stole time to sit down and watch them play <cite>Romeo and
Juliet</cite>, your basic bitter romance, and then they tacked on one of
those long slow Dire Straits instrumental codas, full of shifts
and stops and orchestrations and really quite totally beautiful.  It made me think of
<cite>Why Worry</cite> from <cite>Brothers in Arms</cite>, which also has an
lovely instrumental outro, and words from its chorus:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>there should be laughter after pain<br/>
there should be sunshine after rain<br/></i></p></blockquote>
<p>Which kind of helped.  I’m still bleeding from the nose when I blow it and
have a low-level headache that just won’t go away and a slow klunky brain with
gears that don’t mesh quite right.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>there should be laughter after pain<br/>
there should be sunshine after rain<br/></i></p></blockquote>
<p>And poor Lauren ate almost nothing for three days and her skin is still
white as chalk.  We’re both pretty healthy people so I guess 
there was some cosmically
good (for the virus, bad for us) match between its RNA payload and our
physiologies.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>there should be laughter after pain<br/>
there should be sunshine after rain<br/></i></p></blockquote>
<p>And the weather forecast saying more rain, more rain, through Friday at
least.
Those crocuses I photographed, for most of them that’ll have been the only sun
they ever saw, I’m hoping the snow wasn’t too rough on the baby daffodils.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>there should be laughter after pain<br/>
there should be sunshine after rain<br/></i></p></blockquote>
<p>And as for that little lyric, I know that for some people, the pain ends
because they die, and before the rain stops too.  The other day I’d forced my
weary bones down to the end of the street for some essentials (baby in
stroller, boy trailing along) and there was this street-guy out in the rain,
wild-haired, wild-eyed, muttering. I bet everywhere I hurt he hurt worse, and
hey, I’ve got a nice big warm dry bed waiting for me.</p>
<p>I’m getting better, really.  I seem to be able to write.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>there should be laughter after pain<br/>
there should be sunshine after rain<br/></i></p></blockquote>

<p>Now, that’s weird.  As I’ve reported before, one of the top
sources of <span class='o'>ongoing</span> traffic is Google image searches for
“tea”; the pretty picture from
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/03/30/Teacup">Tea</a> is
the #1 match.
Only, sometimes not.  It turns out that if you turn SafeSearch off, as in
“Yeah Google, it’s OK to show me the most appalling filth if you find it”,
well, my little red teapot vanishes from the results page.  Turn SafeSearch
back to “Moderate” and there it is.  Is my composition regarded as so chaste
that it must be kept away from pages where Sex Might Happen?  Granted that there
is no naked flesh, but the pot and the cup are both kind of curvy.  Life is
full of mysteries.</p>

<title>Upcoming Gig: Mashup with Arrington</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The Sun marketing person said “We’re doing another startup outreach event,
think you could come down on the 19th and pitch in?”  I said probably and
asked for more info.  “This fellow named, uh, Mike Arrington, has agreed to do
a panel, do you know who he is?”  So I said I’d come.  It’s called the
<a href="http://www.sun.com/emrkt/startupessentials/events.jsp">Mashup
Event</a> and it’s an afternoon thing, basically just Mike and me talking a
little bit about Web 2.0 and Venture Capital, followed by cocktails and schmoozing.
I’ve never met the ubiquitous Mr. A so I’m looking forward to it.  If you’re
in the area and can spare an hour, drop by our coolio Menlo Park campus and
join in the fun. Our entirely-unhidden agenda: find out what’s going on, &amp;
listen.</p>

<title>Ape News</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>It’s been leveled up to the Protocol-13 draft level and the source is
available.  While I’m still massively unsatisfied,
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/11/Meet-the-Ape">the Ape</a> as it stands
today is actually pretty useful.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>What’s Wrong</h2>
<p>The Ape is about 2,000 lines of Ruby that, in a meandering
stream-of-consciousness sort
of way, walks something that claims to be an APP server through its paces.
Basically, I’ve developed it by sketching in a few initial tests, running it
against a lot of different APP servers, and adding tests to cover the weird
shit I observe.</p>
<p>What the Ape <em>should be</em> is a big portfolio of test cases, known
problems that occur, with an easy way to add new ones that doesn’t involve
writing ad-hoc Ruby code.  [Credit for this idea
to Sam Ruby.]  Trouble is, I’ve started to implement this about three times
now and haven’t come up with a good way of encoding either the test cases or
the expected results.
I haven’t given up, though.</p>
<p>For another excellent approach, check out Joe Gregorio’s
<a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/apptestclient/">APP Test Client</a>,
which has an actual GUI, and is probably quite a bit more useful than the Ape
for zeroing on on some protocol pain point you’re trying to debug.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>What’s OK</h2>
<p>The Ape actually does a reasonably-OK job of characterizing an APP server
implementation in a hands-off, automated way.  It tries out the most
obvious things an APP client would want to do: Fetch the service doc, find
collections to post to, post an entry, update the entry, delete the entry,
post a graphic, delete the graphic.  
Most obviously, it complains about errors, but along the way, it reports on what the
server actually does in a lot of places where the behavior isn’t tightly
constrained by the APP spec: slug, foreign markup, categories, content
round-tripping, summaries, lots more.</p>
<p>My suspicion is that if the Ape gives a server implementation a clean bill
of health, a client written to the spec would be able to use that
implementation to create, update, and delete Web resources, and quite likely
Just Work.</p>
<p>And by the way, as of the writing of this I’m not aware of <em>any</em> APP
server implementations that get green check-marks all the way down the line from the
Ape.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>How To</h2>
<p>You can get the MIT-licensed source at 
<a href="http://ape.dev.java.net">ape.dev.java.net</a> (just because it’s on
java.net doesn’t mean that it needs to have any actual Java code, y’know), or
you can just go to  <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ape/">www.tbray.org/ape</a>
and  point the Ape at your server.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>To Do</h2>
<p>The biggest thing I want to do with the Ape is switch it back to JRuby so I
can go back to RelaxNG-validating all the APP docs with Jing.  That was
incredibly useful at turning up little bits of subtle weirdness in server
implementations, and its absence has forced a bunch of ad-hoc checks for this
error or that into the source code.</p>
<p>There are some more things I could add, but at the moment, the best source
of input is running this against APP server implementations, each one of
which seems to reveal new potential gotchas that the Ape should report on.</p>

<title>Baby Dread</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Suppose it’s really late and you have a little baby who’s
cranky (maybe sick) and can’t or won’t sleep and you’ve tried all the usual
tricks and they’re not working.  Here’s my ultimate weapon, and while the
sample size is only my two children, it does span genders.</p>
<img src="Natty-Dread.png" alt="Natty Dread" class="inline" />
<p>What you do is you turn on the CD player, turn up the volume, and queue up
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natty_Dread">Natty Dread</a>, the 1974
album by Bob Marley and the Wailers.  Neither of my babies, no matter how
upset, made it past the first three or four songs.</p>
<p>In particularly stressed-out circumstances, it helps to sing along.
Nobody’s going to have a problem with crooning <i>No woman, no cry</i>
over and over again, but I sometimes have to suppress a snicker while singing
<i>Them belly full (but we hungry)</i>; neither she nor I are skinny or
disadvantaged really at all.  But hey, it’s a good tune, you could dance to
it.</p>
<p>The boy, when he was a baby, wanted to be walked around while groovin’ to
the Wailers, but the girl is OK with Dad humming bass parts in the rocking
chair.</p>
<p>It’s probably worth mentioning another advantage of this child-rearing
technique: the music is excellent.  The song frameworks are
simple, minimal even, (that’s why it’s easy to sing along) but the band is
amazingly free in the way they work around and through them.  Sweet stuff;
gosh, I wish Bob hadn’t died.</p>

<title>5✭♫: Misa Criolla</title>
</head>
<body>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Ram%C3%ADrez">Ariel
Ramírez</a> is an Argentinean composer born in 1921; <cite>Misa
Criolla</cite>, a 1964 mass for tenor, mixed chorus, percussion, keyboard and
(especially) Andean folk instruments.  It appears on several disks; I’m
going to recommend two featuring
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Carreras">José Carreras</a>
and 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_Sosa">Mercedes Sosa</a>.
<i>(“5✭♫” series introduction <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music">here</a>;
with <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music#p-1">an
explanation</a> of why the title may look broken.)</i></p>
<img src="Ramirez.png" alt="Ariel Ramírez" />
<div class="caption"><p>Ariel Ramírez</p></div>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Context</h2>
<p>Ramírez studied the formalities of Western composition for years, then
discovered his own nation’s back-country music and put the two together.  
He got a little lucky; he finished his setting of the non-Latin Mass as the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Vatican_Council">Second Vatican 
Council</a> was in the news.   The worthies of the Catholic church realized
that <cite>Misa Criolla</cite> was as articulate an expression of faith as
anyone had produced in a long time, and all of a sudden Ramírez was in an
enviable situation as the composer of a popularly-successful piece of music
that had the church behind it.</p>
<p>The original recording, in 1964, was a huge hit, but I’ve never heard it.
The famous version is the one with Carreras, but I’ve heard more than one
critic compare it unfavorably with the original, which I really must try to
track down.</p>
<img src="Misa-Criolla.png" alt="Misa Criolla featuring José Carreras" class="inline" />
<h2 id='p-2'>The Music</h2>
<p>To be brutally honest, Ramírez has been something of a one-hit wonder and
without this work would be
at best a footnote to musical history.  But if you’re only going to have one
hit, <cite>Misa Criolla</cite> is a good one to have.</p>
<p>Pretty well everyone’s heard Andean folk instruments now; anywhere there’s
busking, in a public park market or the subway, they turn up, with their
Pan-pipes and big drums and acoustic guitars.  Mostly it sounds kind of
New-Agey, but that’s because that’s what works for buskers.</p>
<p>Ramírez, on the other hand, takes the text of the Catholic Mass in the
purest high Castilian Spanish,
sets it to an insanely-beautiful sequence of melodies, and places
the solo voice and chorus, with piano and some extra drums, in front of the
Andean band, and the orchestration is a triumph, every second of it; it makes all
those buskers sound anodyne, which indeed they mostly are.</p>
<img src="Misa-Criolla-with-Sosa.png" alt="Misa Criolla featuring Mercedes Sosa" class="inline"/>
<p>I could go on about one section or another or this particularly clever
placement of the drum behind the chorus or the guitars swirling around the
soaring vocals, but let’s save some time:  Everyone whom I’ve played this for, ranging
from my Mom to drug-addled Seventies head-bangers, has liked it.  Most
probably, you will too.</p>
<p>I see that there are lots of versions for sale online, and this music is
just way too beautiful to subject to MP3 emasculation, so a shiny silver disc
is the way to go.  The question is, which one?</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Sampling It</h2>
<p>José Carreras is the least-famous of the “Three Tenors”, he’s a serious
opera singer and treats <cite>Misa Criolla</cite> with overt reverence.
Mercedes Sosa is a popular Argentinean folk singer (called “La Negra” for her
flowing jet-black hair); she sings <cite>Misa Criolla</cite> straightforwardly
with a folk feel.
I’d hate to be without either version.</p>
<p>Sosa’s version (from 1999) is easier to listen to.  It’s recorded with fairly
conventional audio values, and she doesn’t try to overdo it, just flows
through the tracks letting the music do the work; she’s got an appealingly
lived-in voice and a whole lot of rhythm, and, well, how could you not like
it; beautiful tunes, beautiful arrangements, and an appealing vocal?</p>
<img src="Sosa.png" alt="Mercedes Sosa" />
<div class="caption"><p>Mercedes Sosa</p></div>
<p>Carreras’ take, from 1990,  is something else again.  He takes each note, polishes it
till it glows, and explores it as he passes through, sometimes lingering and
others rushing,
drops in behind the instruments and choir then leaps out like a tiger, and goes
into full operatic howl mode for the big <cite>Paz a los hombres</cite> chorus
that’s at the centre of <cite>Missa Criolla</cite>.  On top of this, it’s
recorded with audiophile values, which means the quiet sections are
<em>really</em> quiet, you’re going to have to turn off the background noise
and you’re still going to be surprised when the drums and pan-pipes and chorus
and José get their mojo working on the loud parts.</p>
<img src="Carreras.png" alt="José Carreras" />
<div class="caption"><p>José Carreras</p></div>
<p>I really don’t know; Mercedes sings a part and you think “Damn that’s a
lovely tune”; José goes to work on it and you think “My God, that phrase is like
an alabaster vase on a crystal shelf.”  Which is better?  Your call.</p>
<p>Me, I like histrionics and heroics, and I think no singer ever has come
close to José’s skill at filling a room and your heart with a phrase sung
<i>pianissimo</i> so you find you’re not breathing because you couldn’t stand
to miss a microsecond.  So I’m probably in the Carreras camp, but only by a
bit.</p>

<title>Aping</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Today
<a href="http://bitworking.org/news/138/Testing-the-APE">Joe Gregorio pointed the Ape at his “apptestsite”</a>
and found some problems.  And the Ape found some problems with
his stuff too.  So we both fixed ’em and the Ape’s much happier.
This is fun!</p>
<p>There are still grumbles
about Joe dropping foreign markup (a <code>dc:subject</code>) and not
accepting an input category, but his code is within its rights.
Doesn’t mean I’ll take the complaints out, they’re useful information about
the quirks of one particular implementation.</p>
<p>I bet there’ll pretty quickly be market pressure for APP server
implementations to preserve at least some foreign markup.  Those guys pushed
back pretty hard in the WG about writing that requirement into the spec, which
is fair enough, but shooting ad-hoc extension markup around is just going to
be too useful, I bet.</p>
<p>Hey, Joe’s server actually has paged collections with
<code>&lt;link rel="next" /></code>, the first I’ve seen; but the Ape’s not
seeing them for some reason, that’s a job for tomorrow.</p>
<p>My logfiles say there were a couple of dozen different computers out there
exercising the Ape today, and Ben Lund sent along a couple of good patches;
thanks!</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Q: Are Globals Ever OK?</h2>
<p>When I was learning Ruby, I found out it had global variables <cite>a
la</cite> Perl, with a <code>$</code> in front.  Ewww, I thought.
But then in the Ape code there are some manifest constants, in particular the
namespace names for Atom and APP and XHTML, as well as well-known MIME types.
They need to be centralized and have symbolic names because they change,
albeit rarely.</p>
<p>I was thinking of having a Constants class or module so I could say
<code>Constants::AtomNamespace</code> or some such.  But then I thought
“simpler is better” and just used <code>$atomNamespace</code>,
<code>$appNamespace</code>, and so on.
Should I feel unclean?</p>
<p><i>[Update: OK, the commenters convinced me, that was unclean.  There’s now
<code>names.rb</code> and I can say things like
<code>Names::XmlNamespaces</code> and
<code>Names::AtomMediaType</code>.]</i></p> 
<p>(Oh, and Ruby needs an IDE.  Because I want to change the names of these
things to make them more readable and I want to change the name of the file
that defines them from <code>namespaces.rb</code> to <code>constants.rb</code>
because I want to add media-types.  Without an IDE, this will involve several
minutes of tedious error-prone editing.  With one, it’s a fail-safe point and
click.
Sigh.)</p>

<title>The Open-Source Process</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I have the good fortune to work for the
<a href="http://www.businessreviewonline.com/os/archives/2007/01/where_does_open.html">world’s
largest creator</a> of Open-Source software.  Big companies being what they
are, this means that There Is A Process.  Recently, I went through it, and I
thought the story might be of mild interest to those who are trying to figure
out how to make a living at the intersection of the profit motive and OSS
culture.</p>
<p>What happened was that after getting an Atom-Protocol paper accepted at
OSCON 2006, I decided that I had to have some actual code to show, so I whipped up
a quickie called the Atom Protocol Exerciser, APE for short, and I’ve been
whittling away at it ever since.  I thought “I should release this, someone
might find it useful” and there I was on the slippery slope.</p>
<p>When I first dropped by the internal Sun Open Source Review page, my heart
sank, and I snarled away in IM at
<a href="http://www.webmink.net/">Simon Phipps</a>, saying “this thing is designed
to discourage,” but he was gentle and open-minded, and I’ve decided that while
the process isn’t perfect, it isn’t about discouraging you, it just wants you
to prove that you’re serious.  Given the number of OSS projects eagerly
announced and then left to moulder on SourceForge or equivalent, I suspect
this is probably a good thing.</p>
<p>My experience is specific to something that’s not going to become a Sun
product and is going out with a vanilla OSS license (MIT in the Ape’s case;
less is more).
I expect the experience would be different for a product that we’re going to
ship and support, which is entirely appropriate.</p>
<p>The process is all automated through a set of Web forms that are
integrated with internal email; it even tracks how much time you’ve spent
waiting for various levels of approval.  It ain’t pretty but it seems to sort
of work.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of steps.  You have to get approval from your own
management chain up to the nearest Vice-President.
Along the way, you need sign-off from Brand Management, Trademark Legal, and
International Trade Legal (export-control regulations are a cross big
companies like Sun have to bear).
Once that’s done, OSS Supremo Simon Phipps has to sign off, as well as our
designated Open Source Legal Heavy.  There’s a bunch of extra work if patent
applications are involved, which fortunately I didn’t have to go near.</p>
<p>You have to provide a <em>lot</em> of information about your project, what
it does, where it’ll live, why it’s worth doing, and so on.  This seems fair
to me.</p>
<p>The one that was the most work was the Trademark piece.  You just can’t 
assert “I’ll call this Foobar” and publish the code; lots of good names are
taken and if you work for a public company, you really don’t want to
accidentally step on someone else’s trademark with your coolio project name
because if you do, they’re gonna call their attorneys first thing.</p>
<p>I actually wanted the trademark people to check out both “Atom Protocol
Exerciser” and “Ape”; they told me in the politest possible way that this costs
real money and real time so would I please bloody well pick one; fair
enough.</p>
<p>I reported a couple of what I consider bugs in the process, where you can
end up waiting for approval without knowing who exactly you’re waiting for.
On the other hand, when a couple of them stretched out, general complaints in
the direction of That Department unjammed them pretty quick.</p>
<p>Checking out names takes time—a couple of weeks in my case—that’s just a
fact of life.  Aside from that, the process pretty well moved right along,
occasionally requiring me to snarl politely at someone “Having a problem with
my OSS application?”</p>
<p>In fact the Ape could have been approved for publication last September,
only when it washed up on the nearest VP’s desk (that would be Laurie Tolson,
my manager at the time) I was real busy with something else and forgot about
it; I’m sure if I’d sent a one-line email along the lines of “Hey Laurie, can
you approve my OSS release already?” she would have.   As it happens, she
cleared it before I got around to bugging her.  That aside, the whole process
would have taken about 21 days.</p>
<p>Seems about OK to me.</p>

<title>Twenty-First Century Recruiting</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Google is hiring.  And there was a Tuesday in last week.  Mind you,
<em>everybody’s</em> hiring.  But jeepers, I got a friendly email yesterday to my
@sun.com address from a Google recruiter, subject “Exciting Job
Opportunity with Google!” saying “saw your blog, we sure are a
great place to work, want to talk?”.   Now, it’s <em>really</em> easy to dig
up my private non-Sun address.  Not to mention my phone number.  Am I
old-fashioned, or does this seem a little desperate?  I assume that more or
less everybody in the biz who’s got a blog or is otherwise publicly visible
will be getting email @work from the big G.   Anyhow, I wrote back
saying “Thanks, but enjoying my job just now.” and she wrote back saying OK and 
“Feel free to pass along my contact information to any friends or colleagues
who you think might be interested in exploring opportunities with Google.” 
I’ll get right on it.
What’s next; sandwich-men in high-tech parking lots?</p>

<title>Shellflower I</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Attentive readers will remember that in
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/01/">January of this
year</a>, the family 
and I spent some time in Gippsland, Australia, in particular on the beach at
<a href="http://www.parkweb.vic.gov.au/1park_display.cfm?park=83">Cape
Conran park</a>.
On the big beach there where they surf, you can find remarkable
sea-shells.  The process by which the waves slowly turn them to white sand 
is transparent here, as you can pick up all sorts of shells once
cone-shaped which are eroding away, revealing in the process unsuspected
beauty of internal structure.  They look like flowers. 
I brought a bunch home and I’m trying to photograph them.</p>
<img src="IMGP4682.jpg" alt="Eroded sea-shell from Cape Conran" />
<p>It’s quite a challenge.  I think the right technique is going to be the one
invented by
<a href="http://alexwaterhousehayward.com/blog/blog.html">Alex
Waterhouse-Hayward</a>, of using a flatbed scanner; see how it worships a
rose
<a href="http://www.ubcbotanicalgarden.org/potd/2005/12/rosa_harwanna.php">here</a>.
Alex says “The depth-of-field is immense, just hang the flower over the scanner
and turn the lights out”.  Yeah, well, he’s got more technique than I do
obviously.  How to hang a seashell over a scanner in such a way that it <em>holds
still</em> is not self-evident; I’m now looking for Plan C.
Also I have depth-of-field problems.  But my first few attempts, although
fatally flawed, are damn visually dramatic so I’ll keep plugging away at
that.</p>
<p>For the picture above, I put the shells on a black cushion and the Tamron
70-210mm on the Pentax DSLR, clamped it onto my pretty-good tripod, told the 
camera to use <i>f</i>/8 and pick its own shutter speed, which with interior
light was several seconds at ISO 200 which is OK with the shutter on
delayed-release and me at the other end of the room.
Plus fairly heroic Photoshopping to subtract the cushion textures.</p>
<p>I expect this project to combine extreme phototech geeking with worship at
the temple of Natural Beauty.  What’s not to like?</p>

<title>Shellflower III</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Ooh, I got the Waterhouse-Hayward technique working with the flatbed
scanner; it’s wonderful!
Check out what happens when a dead mollusk collaborates with several years of
intense surf.  <i>[Series intro
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/03/13/Shellflower">here</a>.]</i></p>
<img src="shell1.png" alt="Eroded sea-shell from Cape Conran" />
<img src="shell2.png" alt="Eroded sea-shell from Cape Conran" />
<p>Obviously, two sides of the same shell.  The first shows a flat face so
it’s just lying on the scanner.  It wouldn’t lie flat for the second so I had
to suspend one end with thread, and indeed when one end’s grounded the
other eventually stops oscillating.</p>
<p>Um, I suppose I should record the equipment; it’s a CanoScan 3000F plugged
via USB into a white-box running Windows XP and the CanoScan Toolbox software.
There’s still room for improvement.  I haven’t figured out how to tell the
scanner to just scan the corner where the shell is, which means I’m scanning
at only 300DPI; the scanner can go way higher, but when you scan the whole
8½x11" area at more than 300DPI, it complains about digital artifacts larger
than 100MB.  This is good enough for the screen, but if I want to print I’ll
need a few hundred more DPI.</p>

<p>The WEP-200 is a Bluetooth headset, I use it with both my
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/27/Phone">Samsung phone</a> and my Mac
(works great for Skype).  I’d wholeheartedly recommend it, assuming you find
it comfy in your ear.  It’s small enough that you have a little less of the
cyborg look when you walk down the street connected, elegant-looking, has
great sound, and seems to mostly Just Work.</p>
<p>That’s the minor recommendation.  The major recommendation is that if you
want a Bluetooth headset (and you do, if you use your phone much in your car;
wanna stay alive?) the place to get one is the Palm store located conveniently
in major airports.  Not only do they have a bunch of Bluetooth headsets on
sale, they have one of each in a drawer so you can stick ’em in your ear and
see how they feel/sound.  I’m almost sure that brain cancer can’t be
transmitted by sharing headsets.</p>

<title>Wobble and Laswell: Radioaxiom</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>What happened was, I was thinking of listening to something by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jah_Wobble">Jah Wobble</a>, long one of
my musical heroes, and the W’s are down at the bottom right of the thousands
of CDs so you have to bend and stretch to see them, and lo and behold, what do
I come across but <cite>Radioaxiom</cite> by Mr W and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Laswell">Bill Laswell</a>, which I
not only don’t recall buying but totally can’t even remember ever having
heard of.   I’ve listened to it three nights in a row now.</p>
<p>The subtitle is <cite>A Dub Transmission</cite> and yep, it’s dub all
right; if you don’t want to read occasional ravings about good dub then
you’re reading the wrong blog.</p>
<p>Since Wobble comes before Laswell, out of alphabetical order, on the cover,
we can assume, as with scientific papers, that he was in the lead.  The
listening experience would support that hypothesis, with distinctively-Wobbley
interjections from sweet although pentatonic Asian-flavored female singers.</p>

<p>Check out
<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/03/the_web_20_addr_1.html">The
Web 2.0 Address Book May Have Arrived</a> by Tim O’Reilly, passing along (with
approving remarks) David Pogue’s
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/15/technology/15pogue.html?_r=2&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;adxnnlx=1174160992-Y2ljSYsni0UWzLiXrwOlVQ&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;oref=slogin">pitch for GrandCentral</a>; it gives you a single
phone number that rings all your phones wherever you are.  Says David: “Its
motto, ‘One number for life,’ pretty much says it all.”
Since I have a similar service through
<a href="http://www.accessline.com/">AccessLine</a> courtesy of Sun, I can
appreciate a resource like this.  But there was something about the
announcement that was bothering me.</p>
<p>What was bothering me was the company name, GrandCentral.  Hold on a
second, I thought, I know them; one of Halsey Minor’s startups.  
They do Enterprise Service Bus or Web Services
aggregation or something like that.  New business model?  It turns out Tim has
the story on that: “(Note: I was on the board of the company formerly known as
Grand Central, which is connected to this one via its name and its primary
investor, Halsey Minor, but I have no connection to the current company.)”</p>
<p>OK then, but the logical conclusion is that the motto, more accurately,
should be “One number for life, as in the lifetime of this particular
incarnation of this particular company.”  Call me paranoid, but I get
nervous sometimes about outsourcing my calendar to Google and my data backup to
Amazon and my email to Yahoo and my pictures to Flickr and my bookmarks to
Del.icio.us.</p>
<p>Out there in the cloud, your personal treasures should be better off,
managed by professionals, we all know the mantra.  And I even believe it, mostly;
wrangling backups and data replication is a crappy use of my time, or really
of anybody’s time who isn’t a full-time pro.  I wish I could worry less.</p>

<body>
<p>Wow, he’s working here, as of today.   This was cooked on the extra double
secret hush-hush; congrats to those involved on the leakage control.</p>
<p>So, what’s it all mean?  Ian’s
<a href="http://ianmurdock.com/">not been stingy</a> with his viewpoints over the
years, but I try to base my opinion of people on what they do
not what they say, and in this case one word says a whole lot:
<a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>.
And there’s a
<a href="http://ianmurdock.com/about">whole lot more than that</a> to Ian’s
story.</p>
<p>If I told you there was a comprehensive plan in place for how Ian’s going
to help us mix
up GNU/Linux’s virtues of seamless package management and fast-improving
user experience with Solaris’ virtues of binary compatibility, observability,
and fast-moving kernel innovation, well, I’d be lying.  But the technology
business is a people business and when you get a chance to bring a good one on
board, you do it and sweat the details later.</p>
<p>Here’s one thing though: Ian’s not going to be just working on Solaris.
Our systems
<a href="http://www.sun.com/software/linux/">run GNU/Linux great</a> and to
the extent that we’re not getting our fair share of that business, I can’t
imagine anyone better-placed to help.</p>
<p>Oh, and here’s a little peek behind the scenes: As of this weekend
Ian wasn’t even on the payroll yet and was already in in a peppy little
email debate over when to say “Linux” and when to say “GNU” and when to say both.
Nobody said this was going to be easy, but let’s have some fun along the way.</p>

<title>Mashing with Mike</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Today we had that Mashup event at the Sun campus with Mike Arrington.  
There were somewhere between 100 and 200 people there; I had fun and
learned things.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/">Mr. Schwartz</a> showed up to say
hello and take a couple of questions; that’s an advantage of doing events
right here on our own campus.</p>
<img src="IMG_0011.jpg" alt="Flowering trees on the Menlo Park Sun campus" />
<div class="caption"><p>Flowering trees on the Sun campus just outside where
we did the Mashup event.</p></div>
<p>To start with, there were a few shows of hands: At least
two thirds of the audience had been attracted by Mike via
<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</a>.  A huge majority, 80% or
more, were doing startups.  When asked if they’d describe
themselves as “Web 2.0”, only a few of the startups’ hands stayed up.  Nobody
would admit to being a VC, although it developed that there was at least one
in the room, but a handful acknowledged being from larger operators: Google,
Yahoo!, and so on.  I said “You know, it’s OK to work for a big company.”</p>
<p>Mike and I had a public conversation about Web 2.0 and Venture Capital for
a little under an hour, with lots of smart interjections from the people who
weren’t sitting on the stage.
I say “conversation” rather than “debate” because we agreed at least half the
time.  One amusing area of contrast (I’m not sure it constitutes disagreement
actually) was on the real meaning of “Web 2.0”; my vision centered on
Contribution Culture and the central role of the human voice.  Mike had a more
technology-focused vision, focusing on the rise of a Web Operating System.
Remember: I’m the technologist, he’s the entrepreneur.  Hmmm.</p>
<p>After the show, a bunch of people wanted to talk to me and I heard about
some cool stuff; then I glanced at the other end of the room and there was a
line-up stretching across it; people waiting their turn, one by one, to pitch Mike.
He’s at the center of the hurricane, no doubt about it.</p>

<title>5✭♫: The Hot Spot</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Dennis Hopper directed
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hot_Spot">The
Hot Spot</a> in 1990, and I’ve never seen it.  He hired
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nitzsche">Jack Nitzsche</a> to
write the music, and they got Miles Davis, John Lee Hooker, Taj Mahal, and
some other really good musicians to play on it.
It’s the only record I know of in which Miles Davis plays straight blues solos
in front of a straight electric blues band, and while there’s some other good
stuff too, that would be enough for me.
<i>(“5✭♫” series introduction <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music">here</a>;
with <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music#p-1">an
explanation</a> of why the title may look broken.)</i></p>
<img src="Hot-Spot-Movie-Poster.png" alt="The Hot Spot movie poster" />
<h2 id='p-1'>The Context</h2>
<p>I could keep a weekly “5✭♫” series running for a few months just writing up
Miles Davis’ music.  I am sure I have readers who are too young or 
jazz-oblivious or just unlucky to have heard much Miles.  I envy you the happy
discoveries you have before you.</p>
<p>For those who know a little Miles, say <cite>Kind of Blue</cite> and
<cite>Porgy and Bess</cite>, you should go listen to some more, there’s a
remarkable amount of remarkably good music out there.  I’ll definitely do a 5✭
write-up someday for some of the lesser-known gems: <cite>Agharta</cite>,
<cite>Ascenseur Pour L'Echafaud</cite>, maybe <cite>Bitches Brew</cite>
even.</p>
<p>Those who like Davis’ music and haven’t already should consider reading
<cite>Miles, the Autobiography</cite>, ghosted by Quincy Troupe.  You’ll learn
a whole lot about jazz and the people who made it and how it all happened,
over the years.  It won’t make you like Davis because he wasn’t a nice man;
but weirdly, when it came down to the music, and to hiring and firing
musicians, he had an almost saintly streak; among other things, the categories
of “white” and “black” and “young” and “old” seemed simply not to exist for
him, when it came to the music.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Music</h2>
<p>This is not a perfect record.  
Too much of it is John Lee Hooker moanin’-and-groanin’ atmospherically in a
way that I’m sure worked just fine as the soundtrack for something in Hopper’s
movie.
There’s also some pretty clichéd slide-guitar work, I think also mostly from
John Lee, who was regularly guilty of veering into hambone territory.  (On the
other hand, he’s made a few 5✭ contributions to the canon, too.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are a half-dozen tracks here where you have that
electric pumpin’ and Miles laying down tracks that are just blues, that’s all,
but put down your computer or book or whatever and listen to them, and in a
quiet way, they’re cosmic.</p>
<p>Probably the two standout tracks are <cite>Bank Robbery</cite> and
<cite>Closing Credits</cite>, which are uptempo and thus push all the players
a little harder.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Sampling It</h2>
<p>I would have thought this fairly obscure but I see it’s for sale at Amazon
so it shouldn’t be that hard to track down.  On the other hand, Miles and John
Lee are both dead and furthermore I’m pretty sure that given the reptilian
ethics of the movie and music businesses, the surviving artists aren’t going to
see a penny of any money you might spend on this disc.</p>

much for something with RAW and more interesting glass and so on, but
apparently the camera biz

<title>JRuby Servlets</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I got
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/03/09/Ape">the Ape</a> running on JRuby and
wired
<a href="http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/jing.html">Jing</a> back in,
which is really useful (some of the so-called Service Docs out there are
canine fecal matter).  I was
pretty damn impressed when the now-2400+ lines of Ape code totally just worked
in JRuby.  Then, I was irritated by the realization that my primitive CGI setup for
running the Ape is just not gonna fly if I have to start up a JVM and JRuby
for each request.  So I thought “this is what servlets are for, right?” and
the good news is that It Can Be Done.</p>
<p>Of course, there were those who told me “We’re working on this, just make
the Ape a Rails app and our magic Web Integration will solve the problem!”
“Feh” I said.  “Camping?” “Bah.”   I cast aspersions at
frameworks near and far, I’m a PORO kinda guy; if you have
<code>Builder::XmlMarkup</code> and a pure heart you’re good to go IMHO.
Templates?  Scaffolds?  ActiveWhatever?  No, use the Web Architecture, Luke!</p>
<p>It turns out that Marcin Mielżyński had already constructed a RubyServlet
with some inspiration from Jython’s PyServlet.  It didn’t work with 0.9.8, but Marcin was
hanging out on #jruby and heard me whining and morphed it then &amp; there,
and now it does. 
It took a whole lot of string and glue and reading source code but now I have
it running here on my Mac and I have to say it’s cool to point my browser at
some JRuby code and have it refresh like <em>instantly</em>, whether because
the output is dynamic or because I went and edited the script.</p>
<p>This is not quite ready for prime time; we need to have a bunch of
debates.  Should RubyServlet be part of the core JRuby.jar?  Should you have
to copy all eleven (!) JRuby .jar files into your app server?  And, most important and
fun, how should you map URIs into JRuby method calls?  Oh yeah, and once we’ve
finished arguing, a little documentation wouldn’t hurt so you don’t have to
plow through Marcin’s Java code to figure out how to connect A to B.</p>
<p>Humorous side-note; I was talking this over with Charles Nutter and he
wondered if Marcin had done anything about the new Java integration in 0.9.8,
and I didn’t even know.  Gimme something that claims to be an
<code>HttpServletResponse</code> and I’ll call <code>getWriter</code> on it
and then I’ll call <code>println</code> whatever comes back and it all Just
Works.  Duck Typing and Java, sittin’ in a tree... we make progress.</p>

<p>If I had fallen over dead any time between about 1999 and last year, my
headstone and any obituaries would have said “Computer geek who was in the
room when XML was invented.”   I’m beginning to think that the
<a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/">Atom Publishing Protocol (APP)</a>
has a chance to crowd XML off the headstone.</p>
<img src="Atom-logo.png" alt="Atom logo"  class="inline" />
<p>A few of my browser tabs have related stories and I’d been planning a

<a href="http://rollerweblogger.org/roller/entry/latest_links14">an APP news
roundup</a>; well, actually there’s an interesting non-APP link, but he got
the good stuff.</p>
<p>Then today,
<a href="http://blog.unto.net/">DeWitt Clinton</a>
<a href="http://www.imc.org/atom-protocol/mail-archive/msg08877.html">asked</a>
the Atom Working Group “Did you know we just released our 8th APP-based public

<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/index.html">here’s the

<p>In late-breaking news, Bill de hÓra
<a href="http://www.dehora.net/journal/2007/03/get_some_interop.html">points

<title>Black Beauty</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>So I went ahead and ordered a maxed-out black MacBook, not a Pro, ignoring
the advice of the majority of people who commented on my
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/01/26/Which-Mac">earlier consideration</a>
of the choice.   I’m blogging from it.</p>
<p>Look, I diss Apple quite a bit in this space, but there are some things
they get right; in particular the thing (I’m sure it has a name), where after
collecting your name and address, the new laptop says “got an old Mac you want
to transfer from?” and if you say yes, you plug in the FireWire, and in a
couple of hours, your new Mac is your old Mac.</p>
<p>To an amazing degree, it just works.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Hardware</h2>
<p>Off the top, I have no gripes with the glossy screen, and I find I can type
about as fast as I did on the PowerBook, which, given that I’ve only been here
a couple hours, suggests that I’ll be faster soon.</p>
<p>None of the apps I’m running except maybe Camino show off the performance
of the CPU, which ought to be quite a bit snappier than the PowerBook’s.
Well, the fact that Photoshop Elements 3 running in emulated mode is more or
less about as fast is indicative.  How ’bout a Universal Binary there, Adobe?
I’ll have to get around to firing up iMovie HD soon.</p>
<p>The trackpad seems quite a bit better at ignoring spurious input than the
PowerBook’s.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Gripes</h2>
<p>The things that transferred did not include my many httpd.conf
customizations, so I can’t run the Ape and it doesn’t assume that a URI that
doesn’t end in an extension is in HTML and UTF-8.</p>
<p>A few of my settings didn’t transfer, oddly enough, and it took a while to
sync up with the Time server; but that was easy to fix.</p>
<p>I pretty quickly discovered there was no <code>/usr/local</code> and in
fact no developer tools; had to go back and install ’em off the DVD.  No
biggie I guess.</p>
<p>I have to tap the trackpad quite a bit harder than I did on the PowerBook,
it’s still ignoring me half the time.  Sidetrack used to let me remap the
button to right-click, I’ll have to check whether that still works; otherwise
the button will be wasted.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Conundrum</h2>
<p>I’ve got a ton of code around from Fink and apt-get all setting in /sw/.  
For example, mysql.  I guess that’s all running under Rosetta now.  I wonder
if there’s a one-liner to swap in Intel binaries for all of those?</p>

<p>Our winter is now sufficiently bad to be a

news story</a>.  It’s rained 19 of the last 23 days, and there’s a
heavy-downpour warning over at Environment Canada.  To make things more
interesting, the snowpack on the mountains is melting, so the rivers are
rising.  The scenario that nobody wants to think about is when you get
a monster rainstorm at the same time as a really big snowpack runoff crest
and then that coincides with a big high tide.  There are some parts of
Vancouver you really wouldn’t want to be in were that to happen.  But we don’t
live in one and anyhow, Spring has be almost here... right?</p>

<title>The Signal</title>

<body>
<p>I often listen to the radio as I sit up in the evening after everyone else
has gone to bed.  By radio I mean
<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/radio2/">CBC Radio 2</a>, which used to be called CBC
FM.  They’re famous for classical, but for some time now have had a decent
jazz program, <cite>After Hours</cite>, starting at ten.
No longer.  A couple of nights I turned it on and now it’s
<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/radio2/programs.html?THE_SIGNAL_TOR">The Signal -
With Laurie Brown</a>.
I was hopelessly smitten with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Brown_%28broadcaster%29">Laurie Brown</a> many years ago when she was
simultaneously the hottest and smartest VJ on MuchMusic (Canada’s MTV), and
this during those fifteen Eighties minutes when videos mattered.  
In any case, <cite>The Signal</cite> is promising; it’s doing contemporary
music without much concern for genres. 
But you know, it could lighten up a bit; that first night, there was some
Björk and some interesting guitar noise and then something called (I’m not
making this up) <cite>Completely Embraced by the Beauty of
Emptiness</cite>.  Eventually I had no choice but to turn off the radio and
put on some ZZ Top.  But then I listened again Thursday and they played 
<cite>Dharma at Big Sur</cite>, a 2003 work by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Coolidge_Adams">John Adams</a> that
I’d never heard, and hey, it’s great, going to have to get it.
Check out Radio 2,

it to play on Camino, grumph.</p>

<p>The rain let up about three and we got out to do a little pruning and
gardening.  The daffodils look good but I got something wrong and even under a

maybe a week and a bit from showing blossoms.</p>

<p>The yellow artifact in the lower right is real, the vague shapes behind the

<p>As I noted yesterday, I was having no luck with pictures of daffodils.  The
problem is that the outer fringe of petals is so much lighter than the inner
trumpet that it’s hard to make the trumpet look good without over-exposing the
fringe.
I’ve still got some ideas to explore, but I am making progress, I think.</p>

<title>On Aggression</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The recent Internet Nastiness
<a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2007/03/as_i_type_this_.html">experienced
by Kathy Sierra</a> has started a discussion about aggression in general;
is it ever OK to go on the attack, or should we try to adopt a mutual
non-aggression treaty covering the whole blogosphere?
On reflection, I think that, yes, it’s OK to go negative, but only if you mean
it and are doing it seriously, and only if you’re prepared to deal with the
consequences.  It may be the case that some legislative tinkering is required
to make accountability work better.
<i>[Update: 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/03/27/On-Aggression#p-18">Hani responds</a>, and I’ve been Biled.]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Can’t We All Just Get Along?</h2>
<p>At a geek gathering a couple of years ago, there was a 
conversation which included some pretty visible bloggers:
the only two I remember for sure are Rob Scoble and me.
Scoble, who seems a genuinely nice person said “Couldn’t we just all agree not
to do attack blogging?” and I think he meant it, but even right there in the
room, the idea didn’t fly, in some part because Rob was at that point working
for Microsoft, and “Let’s agree to be nice to Microsoft” is a tough sell.</p>
<p>I am obviously personally involved in this issue.  In this space I have
criticized, with varying degrees of intensity, parties including the governments
of China and the United States, Microsoft, certain Canadian politicians, some
airlines, the RIAA, ECMA, and the promoters of the WS-* protocols.</p>
<p>I’ve learned that you should never, <em>never</em> launch an online attack
that you’re not prepared to stand behind all the way.  Because the attack
lives forever online, and if it picks up a few links, can really hurt the
target.
So, be sure that you want to.</p>
<p>By and large I don’t regret what I’ve written here, but I intensely regret
some poorly-considered flames I’ve written on mailing lists and forums over
the years that have hurt people who didn’t deserve it.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Polemics and Flaming</h2>
<p>I think there is a difference—a huge, crucial difference—between a
considered
<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/polemic">polemic</a> coming from a
clearly-identified individual, and  
Internet Flaming, in particular anonymous flaming.  Criticism is a necessary
part of human discourse; it is an unfortunate fact that in this world, there
are people and organizations that deserve it.</p>
<p>Flaming is a different story.  Starting sometime around 1980 we have
learned, to our cost, that online communication induces extremely bad behavior
in a small proportion
of people; language designed to hurt and designed
without any thought of the consequences to the sender, the receiver, or the
community they inhabit.  Almost all of us have felt the pain.</p>
<p>We also observe that flaming, left unchecked and practiced recreationally,
can spill over the edge of all the bounds of decency and (perhaps) legality
and become the kind of vicious abuse that drove Kathy Sierra to retreat behind
locked doors.  The people who organized the “meankids” and “bobsyeruncle” sites
where the abuse was launched should have bloody well learned this lesson by
now.  At this point, the only tenable position for those people is abject,
unreserved apology.
Failing that, I suspect, they’ll find that they’ve exited the Internet Conversation.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Thought Experiment</h2>
<p>In the Java community, there’s this guy named Hani
who has a blog called the bileblog that I won’t link to.  Its
contents are almost entirely viciously obscene rants against individuals and
factions in the Java community, based on Hani’s perception of their technical
or ethical failings.  Hani seems to have a fixation on violent, degrading
male-male sexual abuse and this constitutes the core of his attack technique.</p>
<p>He gets away with it—is fairly popular in fact—because he’s also 
funny.  A couple of years ago I and another person were talking this over and 
proposed a scenario: suppose one of Hani’s victims were mugged by four or
five random hoodlums and beaten up severely, while the hoodlums
made witty and amusing remarks to entertain the passers-by and watchers.
Would the violence be OK because of the leavening with humor?  I don’t think
so.  So why is what Hani does OK?</p>
<p>You see, my understanding of the law is that any undesired aggressive
physical contact can constitute “assault”.  I think the law needs to be clear
that there is some line which, when crossed by a flamer, carries similar
consequences, legally.  Yes, it’ll be tricky and involve judgment calls; but
then most ethical/legal issues are and do.  I Am Not A Lawyer; it may be the
case that, in some jurisdictions anyhow, we already have a satisfactory legal
framework.</p>
<h2 id='p-18'>Hani Responds</h2>
<p>In the comments, Hani responded at length, and a fair
number of others chimed in, arguing that my analogy between death
threats, physical violence, and Hani’s flavor of slime was unreasonable and
wrong.  Scroll down and read ’em all.</p>
<p>OK, they’re entitled to their opinion, but mine differs. I also in my youth
had some experience with physical violence, and I’ve been living online for
decades, and there are no sharp black/white dividing lines
between degrees of pain; there are word-fueled assaults that have hurt me
worse than that fist in the belly did.</p>
<p>It’s reasonable to argue about where on the spectrum Hani
falls, but I guess it’s no longer reasonable to allude to him without any
linkage, especially since, shortly after this piece, he found occasion to
<a href="http://www.bileblog.org/?p=326">write about me</a>.  So,
judge for yourself
(I confess that the sentence you are now reading has been written and erased
more than a few times; earlier versions contained bile-reactions some of which
were witty and mentioned Junior High and being pathetic and mojo deficits and
so on, but none of them improved on “judge for yourself”).</p>
<p>But, to those in the Java community who say you haven’t arrived till you’ve
been Biled, I say: Grow up.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>The Lesson</h2>
<p>This incident has written it in letters of fire 500 feet high on the walls of
the Internet: setting up Web properties
which allow recreational flaming predictably leads to bad results, and
people who do it are either stupid or evil or both.  Maybe, just maybe, they
might have been able to claim, up to a couple of weeks ago, that they didn’t
know better; but no longer.</p>

not surprising that she’d be pretty tech-savvy, but even so.  She’s generally
on board with the notion that Open Standards float all boats, and she’s

with voting law (think: Diebold) and the Library of Congress.

<body>
<p>I’ve now been using
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/03/22/MacBook">the new MacBook</a> for a
week.  I think I can conclude that, for my purposes at least, it’s a better
alternative than the Pro would have been.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>What’s Great</h2>
<p>First of all, the battery life is <em>dramatically</em> longer.  I suppose
not having a video card makes a difference, plus the battery is physically
bigger.  Lots of time, when I’m going to be working around the house, I just
don’t bother to plug in.  And with one spare, you’ve got enough hours of work
that you’re probably going to run out of gas way before the computer does.</p>
<p>The stronger Wifi is a big deal too; I can see lots of networks that the
old PowerBook couldn’t.  Wednesday night, when the Washington Westin’s
Internet failed to work, I opened the window and could get along just
fine on the TMobile from the Starbucks eight floors down.</p>
<p>Smaller is good too; I’m typing this in Air Canada econo-class; the worst
possible scenario, in front of the exit row so I can’t lean back, and a rude, 
inconsiderate person in front of me pushed back to the max.  It ain’t
comfortable (I <em>so</em> hate travel these days) but work is happening.
Of course, there’s no free lunch; the screen being only 800 pixels high cramps
my photo-editing style when I don’t have an outboard screen.</p>
<p>I really like the glossy screen; pictures look better.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Gripes</h2>
<p>I’m waiting for a native release of Photoshop Elements, so it’ll be
faster.  It’d probably be smart to get a copy of Lightroom, which is native I
think, and spend more time there.  The non-native Adobe Camera Raw plug-in
processing is particularly painful.</p>
<p>The fan runs more than I think it ought to; really objectionably loud
sometimes.</p>
<p>The keyboard is OK but for some reason my pinky repeatedly fails to find
the Control key, which is a big deal for an Emacs-keystrokes junkie.</p>
<p>Like everyone report, it smudges and marks up awfully fast.  Guess I’ll
have to apply that Mr. Clean recipe I saw somewhere on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>I plugged it into a projector for the first time at Web Design World, and it
refused to see anything more than 800x600, even though the projector could
really do 1024x768.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>TBD</h2>
<p>I haven’t got around to loading up Parallels and Solaris and so on yet.
We’ll see...</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Using the Old Mac</h2>
<p>The black beauty is my fourth Mac.  Two of them are on a shelf in my
office, beat-up and not being used but I can’t bring myself to throw them
out.
The latest, however, is in pretty good shape and I would have held off
upgrading if I hadn’t wanted to try Parallels/Solaris.  So what I think I’ll
do is wipe all the professional data on it and dedicate its 120G disk to being
a music library; load up a bunch of the best CDs to drive the family’s iPods.</p>

<title>Ruby Servlet Dispatching</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’m 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/03/21/JRuby-Servlets">wiring the Ape up</a>
so I can run it with JRuby in a servlet in a real Java App Server, and while
Marcin Mielżyński’s first-cut RubyServlet works fine, I suspect it’s not the
only approach to dispatching.  So I’m doing some research and thinking, and
I’ve collected it here for anyone who cares.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Problem</h2>
<p>Using your app-server config files, you tell it to dispatch requests to
RubyServlet, so in your <code>web.xml</code> you’d have 
something like this:</p>
<pre><code><![CDATA[    <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>RubyServlet</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/ape/*</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>]]></code></pre>
<p>So you have to design your URI space with some sort of a hook 
so you can route the right requests into Rubyland.  Then RubyServlet has to figure
out which Ruby class and method to call.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>What Rails Did</h2>
<p>Rails figures out what class and method to call based on parts
of the URI path.  Until recently there was also an egregious
semicolon hack, but but as <a href="http://pragdave.pragprog.com/pragdave/2007/03/change_to_rest_.html">PragDave explains</a>, 
they’re
cleaning that up.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Marcin’s Solution</h2>
<p>This isn’t actually, you know, documented anywhere, but Marcin’s Java code
is easy enough to read.  It’s about like Rails, using
the last two parts of the URI to pick class
and method, defaulting to a method-name of <code>index</code>.  
It also has code CamelCasing to capitalize class-names and also (not sure why
this is done in Rails either) turn ape_drool to ApeDrool.
So:</p>
<p>so <code>ape</code> calls <code>Ape#index</code>,
    <code>ape/foo</code> calls <code>Ape#foo</code>,
    <code>ape_drool</code> calls <code>ApeDrool#index</code>, and
    <code>smelly/ape/dung</code> calls <code>Ape#dung</code> (but looks for
    the code in <code>smelly/Ape.rb</code>).
In all cases, the Ruby code gets the Request and
Response objects, so it can find out anything it needs to about
what’s going on.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Mongrel</h2>
<p>Mongrel’s job is easier; because in that case your Ruby code controls its 
server, so you can pro-actively register your URIs; docs
<a href="http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/rdoc/index.html">here</a>.  For example:</p>
<pre><code> h = Mongrel::HttpServer.new("0.0.0.0", "3000")
 h.register("/test", SimpleHandler.new)
 h.register("/files", Mongrel::DirHandler.new("."))
 h.run.join</code></pre>
<h2 id='p-7'>What Servlet Actually Does</h2>
<p>Per the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/2.3/javadoc/index.html">Servlet
Javadocs</a>, and in particular the abstract
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/2.3/javadoc/javax/servlet/http/HttpServlet.html">javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet</a>
which is what you end up using, the idea is that you fill in
methods for <code>doGet</code>, <code>doPost</code> and so on, and they get
called with the request and response objects.
Requests actually come in through a <code>service</code> method, which they
expect you to not override, and it does the dispatching.</p>
<h2 id='p-8'>How Jython Works</h2>
<p>Jython is clever, and took me a couple of minutes to figure out.
First, it overrides the <code>service</code> method so that it can dig the
path out of the request
and do tricks similar to Rails or RubyServlet to figure out which Jython class
to call; that class has to extend HttpServlet.
Then, it compiles that Jython into bytecode, and then it
calls the generated code’s <code>service</code> method, which presumbly ends
up routing to the provided <code>doGet</code> and so on.</p>
<p>That compiling-to-bytecode trick sure is handy.  JRuby guys?</p>
<h2 id='p-9'>The RESTless Ape</h2>
<p>I’m perfectly OK with Marcin’s current technique; the Ape only ever calls
one method, and cooking it into the URI causes me no pain.  I guess I should
ensure that it’s a POST not a GET because while the Ape tries to clean up
after itself, it can change the state of the system.</p>
<p>But I kind of think the Ape is in a minority.  Applications, in particular
thoughtfully-designed RESTful applications, <em>do</em> care what the HTTP
method is, and probably would like a bit more flexibility in routing requests
to code than you get by mapping the last two steps in the URI path to class
and method.</p>
<p>In fact, I suspect that the basic Java HttpServlet interface is more or
less what a RESTful app designer would want, with dispatching to
GET/POST/PUT/DELETE handlers.  In particular, if I were building an APP server
implementation, that’d be about right.</p>
<p>So I’ll sketch out some thoughts on what a RESTfulRubyServlet API might
look like.  Now, I don’t need it.  In fact, maybe this is a
<a href="http://c2.com/xp/YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YAGNI</a>.  But if
dozens of people pipe up saying “I need that” then maybe I’ll build it; with
Marcin’s code in front of me it would be no strain at all.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>RESTfulRubyServlet</h2>
<p>The initial problem remains; how do you figure out which class’
<code>doGet</code> and so on to call?
I’d like to borrow Rails culture: not repeat myself and rely on
Convention over Configuration to make it real easy to explain what to do to get
things working.</p>
<p>I note that the typical structure of a Ruby project is a root directory
with <code>src</code> and <code>test</code> subdirectories.  So, why 
not use that?  If you have a webapp named “foo” and
<code>foo/WEB-INF/web.xml</code> says to use <code>RESTfulRubyServlet</code>,
then you look for <code>foo/src/servlet.rb</code> and call
<code>Servlet#doGet</code>, <code>Servlet#doPost</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>It’d be easy to build.
Does the world need RESTfulRubyServlet and if so, is
there a better design?</p>

<p>May it visit endless delays, blocked airplane toilets, and hostile customs
officials on three groups of airline professionals.</p>
<p><i>First</i>, on those who advertise and sell airplane tickets between
Vancouver and San Francisco with confidently-predicted departure and arrival
times.  In my experience, for a variety of reasons, the planes fail to depart
and arrive on schedule on time well over 50% of the time.  This seems odd;
it’s not OK to advertise a bottle of wine as containing 750ml when in fact it
contains much less; but apparently it’s OK to advertise a flight as arriving
at 9:18AM when 
you know that the chances of this happening are much less than 50%.  The
airline industry is accountability-free.</p>
<p><i>Second</i>, on the United Airlines officials who book many more
travelers through Dulles airport than they can actually process in any sane
amount of time. 
I’ve been through twice in the last year and observed people weeping and
otherwise freaking out when they miss flights because they have to line up 
endlessly to check in and then again to get through security.
Clearly, United Airlines knows that it cannot process the number of passengers
corresponding to the number of tickets it sells in any reasonable amount of
time, but it continues to inflict abuse on its customers.  
If you are flying out of Dulles, you need to arrive <em>two hours</em> in
advance of your departure time, or you’re taking a big chance.
The airline industry is accountability-free.</p>
<p><i>Third</i>, on the designers of Terminal 1 at Toronto’s Pearson airport.  It
is a brutal, ugly, soul-crushing piece of architecture.  Its sin is simple: it
is simply much, much, much, too big.  If you need a hallway to be twenty feet
wide to accomodate the traffic, it’s fifty feet wide.  If the ceiling needs to
be thirty feet high, it’s over a hundred.  If a window needs to be ten feet
tall, it’s forty.  Its roof, both arched and curved, ought to be graceful but
is ugly simply because its scale is so vast, making the scurrying
humans beneath seem ant-like.  
It favours a clean fascist-white-everywhere aesthetic over the use of anything
so bourgeois as
<em>colour</em>.  Outside too; looking down
from your airplane window, it’s an awkward graceless monstrous white turd.
On top of which, it’s exhausting and
time-consuming to walk from wherever you are to wherever you’re going.</p>
<p>Why does the airline business hate people?</p>

<title>Web Accountability</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Following on last week’s nastiness, Tim O’Reilly has issued a 
<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/03/call_for_a_blog_1.html">Call for 
a Blogger's Code of Conduct</a>; good stuff.  While the discussion he launches will
certainly be useful, I think you can boil down his point #1 to get one simple
rule that cleanly addresses the legal and ethical realities and isn’t just for
bloggers and that we all should live by: <em>You’re accountable for
what appears on your Web site</em>.</p>
<p>Chris Locke trotted out YOYOW (“You own your own words”) presumably
in an attempt to avoid  damage from the damage around the Kathy Sierra affair,
which involved Web sites he’d launched.  I don’t buy it.  No matter how many
disclaimers you print and libertarian platitudes you intone, if a Web site is
yours, you are ethically and perhaps legally responsible
for what’s there, whoever wrote it.  This is reality; deal with it.</p>
<p>Some things fall out of this; if something bad crops up on one of your
sites, most people feel that when this is pointed out to you, if you promptly
take it down you’re likely to be OK; I’ve even heard lawyers advancing this
point of view.  On the other hand, if you launch a site that encourages
flaming and sliming, and if it gets out of control, and history teaches that
such sites <em>always</em> get out of control, and you’ve been around long
enough to know this, you might reasonably find yourself held responsible for
the damage that gets caused.</p>
<p>I can’t see much to disagree with in the rest of Tim’s proposals, but I
think that Accountability For Your Web Site is an iron law; everything else is
just best practices that fall out as a consequence.</p>

<title>Hofstadter’s Loop</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is about <cite>I Am a Strange Loop</cite> by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Hofstadter">Douglas
Hofstadter</a>; my discussion is picky and pedantic and probably far too long
for any but his devotees; but then, their number is many.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Context</h2>
<p>I, like a whole lot of other people, bought Hofstadter’s <cite>Gödel, Escher,
Bach</cite> in 1980 because Martin Gardner said to, and was dazzled
by the virtuositic writing, erudition, cool typography, and playfulness.</p>
<p>Unlike most others, I was disappointed at the end of
<cite>GEB</cite>.   
Granted, I enjoyed and, dare I say, was enlightened
by the individual discourses on the genetic code and the Gödel proof and the
structure of a Bach fugue and the flavors of recursion and the charming
contrast between reductionist and holist explanation and all that other
stuff.  But at the end of the day and the end of the book, I just didn’t buy
the Big Analogy.  I don’t think the Gödel proof is much like the genetic code
in any interesting way, nor are either much like Bach’s counterpoint.</p>
<p>So what?  You don’t have to buy the conclusion to enjoy the experience of
getting there, and I would say that if you haven’t read <cite>GEB</cite>
carefully, you’re not sufficiently acquainted with some of the key notions that
inform twenty-first century intellectual discourse.</p>
<p>Having said all that, I’m pretty sure that Hofstadter’s finest work, and
the one most likely to have intellectual currency a few centuries from now,
is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Ton_beau_de_Marot">Le Ton beau de
Marot</a>, which is at once stimulating, entertaining, erudite, beautiful, and
tragic.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>My Viewing Angle</h2>
<p>It’s not unlike Hofstadter’s.  I have a math degree and, partly because I
play the cello, an emotional connection with Bach.  At one point I buckled down with the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Nagel">Nagel</a> book long enough
to have convinced myself that I kind of understood Gödel’s argument.</p>
<p>On the other hand, unlike Hofstadter, I eat meat, enjoy watching football on TV,
and like rock music in general and Elvis Presley
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/08/02/SamPhillips">in particular</a>.  Go
figure.</p> 
<h2 id='p-2'>Strange Loop</h2>
<p>In his preface, Hofstadter complains that many who enjoyed (or despised)
<cite>GEB</cite> failed even to notice what he considers its central point,
and tells us that this book is another attempt to drive that point home.  I
worry that he’s talking about precisely that part of <cite>GEB</cite> where
my suspension of disbelief ran out; oh dear.</p>
<p>In this book, I have big problems with his heroic analogizing and 
think he scoots past too much prior art, but he’s got a core argument about
the size of the soul that really doesn’t need the
apparatus he stacks against its sides in an effort to
support it.</p>
<h2 id='p-11'>What’s Good</h2>
<p>Before I get into nitpicking, I should say that there is some wonderful
writing here, as well as two Big Ideas that may not be 100% new but
are beautifully argued and deserve the evangelizing.  First the writing, and
if I may quote by way of example from the conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p>Poised midway between the unvisualizable cosmic vastness of
curved spacetime and the dubious, shadowy flickerings of charged quanta, we
human beings, more like rainbows and mirages than like raindrops or boulders,
are unpredictable self-writing poems — vague, metaphorical, ambiguous, and
sometimes exceedingly beautiful.</p></blockquote>
<p>The first big idea is that one person’s consciousness may live, in part, in
another person’s brain.  The second is that there is not a binary
consciousness/no-consciousness switch; some consciousnesses are bigger than
others.
Hofstadter uses the word “soul” in this context for consciousness.  Following
his usage: In souls, size matters.  And among humans, those with the largest
souls are arguably those who are especially gifted at hosting the
the souls of others; this produces, among other things, the quality that we
label “empathy”, but the argument is bigger and more beautiful than that.</p>
<p>But let me get back to griping, first over Hofstadter’s
overambitious analogizing.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>The Big Analogy</h2>
<p>It seems to me that the most obvious deceased equine tasting the whip here is
reductionist/holist tension.  He
argues over and over that you have to think about high-level problems 
(a basketball shot, the nature of consciousness, the design of a gas valve) at
a high level, without worrying about bosons or neurons or the kinetic theory
of gases.</p>
<p>I don’t see why this is controversial or, really, worth his effort.  Having
said that, if you know anyone who’s a hard-reductionist (I suppose one must
exist), make ’em read this and if they don’t chill out, well then, you know
they’re insane.</p> 
<h2 id='p-5'>The Gödel Problem</h2>
<p>I think Hofstadter has an unhealthy relationship with the
<a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/people/h/hirzel/papers/canon00-goedel.pdf">Gödel proof</a>; in
particular, in obsessing over its mechanics.
He really enjoys explicating Gödel’s fiendish cleverness in finding a mapping
between the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica">Principia
Mathematica</a> apparatus and integer mechanics,
and then launching into the analogical wild blue yonder.</p>
<p>As someone who cares about mathematics, although without sufficient talent
to make it a profession, it seems to me that Gödel’s conclusion is what
matters: you can’t assume that something you can’t prove is false, and you
can’t assume that something that’s true can be proved.   Let me oversimplify:
Truth cannot be mechanized; deal with it.</p>
<p>The two views of <cite>Principia Mathematica</cite>—Russell’s original and
Gödel’s arithmetic mutation—are among the many phenomena to which Hofstadter
attaches the “strange loop” label; to me, using this gap as an analogy, for
example, to that between thinking about neurons and about cognitive symbols is
at best forced.
When, as in Chapter 16, Hofstadter takes his point as proved and starts
routinely referring to his own consciousness (and implicitly mine) as a
“Gödelian swirl”, I find myself actually offended.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Lacunae</h2>
<p>While <cite>I Am a Strange Loop</cite> includes a substantial scholarly
apparatus (end-notes, bibliography, index), it skates by some pieces of
intellectual history that seem to me both relevant and important.  So
I’m going to indulge in some pedantry and fill a couple in.</p>
<h3 id='p-7'>Marx</h3>
<p>Hofstadter quotes, and argues furiously in defense of, the argument by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Sperry">Roger Sperry</a>
that ideas and statements and mental symbols and in particular the notion of
“I” have an objective reality in the world, and this without buying into
dualism or religion.</p>
<p>Which is fine; I agree, and while the truth of this notion seems so obvious to me
that I wouldn’t have invested the pages in defending it, I particularly
enjoyed Hofstadter’s skewering of the sloppy and problematic dualist notion of the
“soul”.  Having said that, it seems at best rude not to have tipped any hats in
the direction of K. Marx, whose influential if now widely-disbelieved writing
on economics were heavily interleaved with weighty Teutonic excursions on
metaphysics, much of which was concerned with showing that you could be a
Materialist and still believe that ideas were Material in the sense of being
real and having force in the world.</p>
<h3 id='p-8'>Theory of Mind</h3>
<p>Perhaps the central interesting idea in this book that hasn’t been
belabored previously by Hofstadter is the notion that in some meaningful way,
the consciousness of one person can exist at least partially in another
person’s brain.  I won’t repeat his argument, which is eloquent and deeply
personal, but it’s a fine piece of work.</p>
<p>But in modern neuropsychology, discussion of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind">Theory of mind</a> is
routine; in fact, I recently read something (can’t put my finger on it) that
presented evidence that the Theory-of-mind function can be localized to
specific regions of the brain.</p>
<p>What is theory of mind?  It’s the indispensible ability, while interacting
with other people, to imagine what it is they are thinking and feeling.  Real
communication is (self-evidently, it seems to me) impossible without such a
capability, and its lack is implicated in certain mental disorders.
Once again, Hofstadter’s lengthy discussion of multiple “strange loops” in one
mind, without at least touching on this work, is unfortunate.</p>
<h3 id='p-9'>The Doors of Perception</h3>
<p>In chapter 15, Hofstadter writes “Put less metaphorically, my sense organs
feed my brain directly” and goes on to show that in fact your brain is
sometimes fed by the sense organs of others.
It seems highly relevant to me (and to one of Hofstadter’s other core
arguments) that, as Aldous Huxley argued powerfully in 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doors_of_Perception">The Doors of
Perception</a>, your sense organs <em>don’t</em> in fact feed your brain
directly.</p>
<p>As Hofstadter argues, your consciousness is in some large
part a construct of the your lifetime’s aggregate inputs, obviously involving your sense
organs.
As he fails to acknowledge, and as Huxley showed, your perceptions are not of the
world directly but are filtered through your “I”-ness, through your own
structure of consciousness, and thus subject to heavy interpretation and
censorship on the way in.
Hofstadter is really missing a trick here, because the notion of the
consciousness built from the accreted input stream then becoming a primary
filter for that stream is probably what he would call a “strange loop”.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Huxley based his argument on his
mescaline-eating experiments, which may prejudice some against it.</p>
<h2 id='p-12'>Read the Book?</h2>
<p>I’d probably recommend it.  But if you haven’t read <cite>Le Ton beau de
Marot</cite>, go read that one first.</p>

<p>I was at a meeting the other day, serving as a panelist at the
<cite>Wikinomics</cite> book launch tour with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Tapscott">Don Tapscott</a>
(interesting stuff, I’ll write about it when I’ve finished reading the book).
During the pre-meeting schmooze I got talking to a University CIO and he was
all excited about the
<a href="http://www.sun.com/blackbox">Blackbox</a>.  “Huh?” I said; he’s in
the middle of a city and has tons of nice modern buildings.  It turns out his
Seventies-era data center filled up a little faster than they’d predicted, and
they have budget and location for a new one but that’s going to take a solid
two years and by December of this year he’s looking at a big-bucks temporary
upgrade of the old facility.  An interim Blackbox in a shed probably saves him
megabucks.  I may have even helped a bit.  I know his campus a bit, and I seem
to remember what the temperature spec on the water hookup is (I won’t guess in
public here though) and if I’m right, he’s got plenty of water that’s more
than cool enough right there.  So I said that and asked him “Are you
sure you’re going to need cooling?” and he brightened right up; if I’m right,
he just saved another pile of dough.
Anyhow, looks to me like the product has legs;
I read somewhere the other day that we’re going to be getting
competition, which is unsurprising.</p>

Kedrosky points out</a>, we geeks need to do a way better job of explaining
DRM to civilians.</p>
<p>First of all, I have a question: is that 256kbps AAC really
“indistinguishable from the original” as
<a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/04/02itunes.html">Apple
claims</a>?   CD is 44.1K 16-bit PCM samples per second per channel, for a gross
bandwidth of 1.4mbps or so if the back of my envelope is right.  Now,
intelligent lossless compression can take you a long way, but reduction by a
factor of over five?  I’d be happy to hear that I’ve missed something
obvious.</p>
<p>I really hope those guys are wrong about the demise of the CD.  It’s such a
great way to buy music; portable, reliable, excellent sound quality when
produced and mastered competently, unencumbered; and usually comes with a
helpful little leaflet full of background.</p>
<p>Finally, I remain astonished that the subscription model hasn’t caught on;
it seems like awfully low-hanging fruit.  There are any number of artists I’d
subscribe to for ten or twenty bucks a year in exchange for an irregular flow
of new material; live cuts, studio work, collaborations, whatsoever, along
with discounts and front-of-the-line access to their regular output.  Which is
ten or twenty bucks a year more than they’re getting out of me now.  The
technology wouldn’t be hard to set up, either.</p>

<title>Any Damn Fool</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is real news:
<a href="http://www.jclark.com/">James Clark</a> has a
<a href="http://blog.jclark.com/">blog</a>, and in it he says “Any damn fool
could produce a better data format than XML”.  Um, James was designated
Technical Lead of the original XML Working Group and is the single largest
contributor to the design of XML.  Also, perhaps, the finest computer
programmer I’ve ever had the privilege of working with.</p>
<p>Let me provide some exegesis: we designed XML as a <em>document</em>
format.
When the world gleefully seized upon it as a data-packaging/RPC tool,
that was OK, but I doubt you could get any of XML’s original designers to
disagree with the statement that JSON, for example, has all sorts of
advantages for wrapping up short-lived strongly-typed data.  Not that the
designers of JSON are any kind of fools.</p>
<p>By the way, I remain pretty convinced that XML, rather than JSON or
equivalent, is the right foundation for the Atom Protocol, because one of its
design centres is posting and updating <em>documents</em>.</p>
<p>Anyhow, as of now James has a long piece up,
<a href="http://blog.jclark.com/2007/04/do-we-need-new-kind-of-schema-language.html">Do we need a new kind of schema language?</a>
It contains more hard-headed sensible discussion of the issues programmers
have with XML than you’ll find in a dozen average essays on the subject.
If you’re doing original work around the intersection of messaging and
programming, you need to read it and think about it.</p>
<p>I don’t agree with all of it, but I’m going to hold my peace until James
has had the chance to do a little more work on his TEDI proposal.</p>
<p>There are half a dozen gems in James’ piece that I’d like to reproduce and
highlight, but I’ll pick just one:</p>
<blockquote><p>XML is fundamentally not OO: XML is all about separating data
from processing, whereas OO is all about combining data and
processing. Functional programming is a much better fit for XML: the problem
is making it usable by the average programmer, for whom the functional
programming mindset is very foreign.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yup.</p>

<title>Passport Hell</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Today I spent nine (9) (no, that’s not a typo) hours in line to apply for a
passport.</p>
<p>What happened was, since the U.S. changed the rules to say everyone’s gotta
have a passport, a lot of Americans and Canadians who were used to going back
and forth between the countries suddenly needed passports, and the systems are
buckling under the strain.  (Hmm... I wonder if Mexico’s is as well?)</p>
<p>My passport’s good till July, but I’m traveling a whole bunch and don’t
have much time here in Vancouver.  Last Monday, April 3rd, was the start of
two no-international-travel weeks.  I’d heard about the line-ups but had no
idea, so I went down there after lunch and got in front of a human being by
3:30.
She sent me away because I was applying for an expedited passport but hadn’t
brought documents to prove I was traveling.  When I told people this story
they were astounded, saying the only way to be sure of getting in on any given
day was to be waiting at 6AM when the building doors opened.</p>
<p>I had the paperwork by Tuesday noon and went back downtown but the security
guys advised against joining the line, saying I’d never get in that day.
Wednesday I was in Calgary and Thursday I was real busy.  Friday and Monday
were government holidays.  This morning, the cab picked me up at 5:50 AM.</p>
<p>I was lucky; arriving at 6:07 meant that I got to wait until 11:39, when I
actually got into the passport room, inside out of the cold.  I brought a folding chair and
that turned out to have been smart.  I did a bunch of back email and some
slides for talks; when the battery got low, I read all of
<a href="http://www.yourbrainonmusic.com/">This is Your Brain on Music</a> by
Daniel J. Levitin
(going to have to write about that book) and
the first hundred pages of 
<a href="http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=0300120486">Caesar:
Life of a Colossus</a> by Adrian Goldsworthy.</p>
<p>Then I was at the front of the line and got the
precious number that they’ll eventually call; mine was in the
needs-a-passport-fast sequence, and at 1PM we were advised that it’d be a
couple more 
hours, go get lunch.  I did, and when I came back, someone had screwed up, my
number had been called long since.  They apologized and fixed me up and I was
out of there a couple of minutes after three.</p>
<p>While
this was unpleasant, it could have been worse.  The people in line were pretty
wonderful: mutually supportive, watching and sometimes carrying each others’ stuff
while they went to get meals and coffee, feed meters, hit the can, whatever.
The people at the passport office, when you get to talk to them, were competent
and pleasant.</p>
<p>The people I really felt sorry for were the security guards who
had to herd the people around and manage the line-up.  They were a bunch of
geezers who were trying hard to stay courteous but had to deal with people who
hadn’t known or whose lives were being seriously fucked up by all this, some
of who got seriously bent out of shape.</p>
<p>Presumably, the backlog will eventually get itself under control.</p>

<title>Good Conduct for Bloggers</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>As several have noted wittily, Tim O’Reilly has managed to accomplish the
near-unthinkable by getting the online community to unite in disagreeing with his
<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/03/call_for_a_blog_1.html">Call for a Blogger's Code of Conduct</a>.
(There’s a
<a href="http://blogging.wikia.com/wiki/Blogger%27s_Code_of_Conduct">wikified
version</a>, not really starting to converge yet).
I personally wouldn’t be able to adopt Tim’s proposal, but I think the
discussion he’s launched is a useful and healthy one, and we all owe a vote of
thanks.  I have one big issue and some little ones, but I also have an alternative to
propose.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Not Just Bloggers</h2>
<p>First off, blogging isn’t that special.  To the extent that any
good-contact rules are required, they’re for any online space that you
control.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Plan B</h2>
<p>Tim’s first point, <i>Take responsibility not just for your own words, but
for the comments you allow on your blog.</i> seems to me all that really matters.
I’d generalize it away from blogs and comments and from just words, rephrase
it in the first-person affirmative, like so:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I am responsible for the material that appears
here.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The phrase that U.S. political candidates are required to use in 
campaign materials might be good enough to steal: <i>I’m Tim Bray and I’m
responsible for the content of this Web site.</i></p>
<p>It’s important to note that this does not necessarily mean that you
<em>agree</em> with everything on the site (I approve lots of comments I
disagree with), just that you’re responsible for
its being there.
By the way, this wording is consistent with my understanding of our legal
responsibilities and what online culture generally expects.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>The Problem With Points 2-7</h2>
<p>The rest of Tim’s proposal is mostly good sense and good advice, but it’s
not appropriate as a policy, simply because it dodges too many judgment
calls.</p>
<p><i>Label your tolerance level for abusive comments.</i>  What’s abusive?
I have been told in public and private that some material I’ve published on
my blog is “abusive” and I just disagree.  This is a fact of life;  anyone who
deals in controversial subjects will be accused of “abuse” on a regular basis.</p>
<p><i>Consider eliminating anonymous comments.</i>  This doesn’t work at all.
I’m responsible for the material that appears on my website, whether or not
it’s signed by someone else or not.  If it’s not something that I think ought
to be on the Web on my site, I’m not going to let it get there or stay there;
whether or not it’s signed really is orthogonal.</p>
<p><i>Ignore the trolls.</i>  This is awfully good advice (I prefer “Don’t
feed the troll”) but it’s not code-of-conduct stuff.  Sometimes they
should be ignored, sometimes they should be sought out, tracked down, and
punished.  Distinguishing between these cases is a judgment call that can’t be
made to go away.</p>
<p><i>Take the conversation offline, and talk directly, or find an
intermediary who can do so.</i>  Well, yes, sometimes.  On the other hand,
there are situations where this is actively evil; some disputes need transparency.
Here’s a story that I’ve been through and have
heard from any number of successful bloggers.  You’re having a problem with a
company or 
organization, and they’re ignoring your input.  Eventually you blog about it,
pick up a few links, and suddenly they’re paying attention to you, and
the first thing they say is “Can we take this off-line?”  The answer should
almost always be “no”; once you’ve started an argument in public on a subject
that people care about it, you have some obligation to let your readers see
how the story plays out.</p>
<p><i>If you know someone who is behaving badly, tell them so.</i>  This one
comes closest to being appropriate for a universial Code of Conduct; don’t let
abuse pass you by silently.  (Mind you, it’s certainly not specific to life
online).  Once again, there are situational issues; sometimes it’s unsafe or
unaffordable or ineffective to confront certain abusive parties, particular those
in a position of power or who employ expensive attack lawyers.  Not everyone
has the obligation to put their neck on the line.</p>
<p><i>Don't say anything online that you wouldn't say in person.</i>
Nope; lots of successful bloggers use an online persona that is quite unlike
their real selves; and this is one of the charms of the medium.</p>

<title>Lightroom Fanboy</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I really don’t often use this space to blather on about how good some piece
of commercial client-side closed-source software is, but, well...
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshoplightroom/">Adobe
Lightroom</a> is a truly great piece of work.  Not only is it just the thing for the
serious photographer, I think it may have advanced the state of the GUI art.</p>
<img src="Lightroom-Screenshot.png" alt="Adobe Lightroom Screenshot" />
<h2 id='p-1'>What It Does</h2>
<p>I’ve noticed that the descriptions of what Lightroom does are kind of vague
and not that helpful, so here’s a short list.</p>
<p>First of all,
<a href="http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2006/02/23/speed-is-a-feature/">Speed is a
Feature</a>.  Everything I’ve used Lightroom for so far, it’s <em>fast</em>,
as in amazingly fast.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It’ll import the pictures from your camera or memory card.  I haven’t
checked this out much yet since I’ve been happy with the Mac’s built-in “Digital
Capture” utility, but I will.</p></li>
<li><p>It has a nice library manager for scanning through your pix.
You can label ’em and rate ’em and colour-code ’em and sort ’em into
collections, and then pull selections out based on any of these.</p></li>
<li><p>Its module for touching up photo is called “Develop” and it lets you crop,
wrangle the histogram, white balance, tone, brightness, contrast, saturation,
vibrance (what’s that?), tone curve, sharpness, lens correction, and a bunch
of other stuff I haven’t figured out yet.</p>
<p>All this editing is done as deltas, thus is non-destructive.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s got a super-nice Export screen that meets my needs
<em>exactly</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>It also has subsystems called “Slideshow”, “Print”, and “Web”, but I
haven’t really tried these out much yet.  My first pass through the Slideshow
screen was a little disappointing; for slideshows on my Mac I find the
built-in Graphic Converter program to be really super.  We have a lovely Canon
photo-printer so I’ll check out the Print facility and report back.  As for
Web presentations, I’ve got all the machinery I need for that.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-2'>What It Doesn’t Do</h2>
<p>The question is whether I still need Photoshop Elements.  The answer is
yes, but not very often.  Lightroom has a “Sharpen” slider, but it doesn’t
seem as sophisticated as what Unsharp Mask does.  Also there’s something that
advertises itself as being like Clone Stamp (what you use to remove things
from pictures), but it’s a little tricky to
operate and I haven’t been getting good results with it yet.</p>
<p>It’s good that I don’t need Elements very often because after a few days
with Lightroom, it feels agonizingly slow.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>GUI Wow</h2>
<p>First of all, did I mention it’s fast?</p>
<p>Second, there’s no Save button.  It just takes care of that.  And
remember, all the edits are deltas, as in non-destructive.  It occurs to me to
wonder why all software that edits any data in any way whatsoever doesn’t work
like this.</p>
<p>The crop function is immensely better than Elements, because it remembers
what you did and you can keep going back and changing your mind and making
slight deltas.</p>
<p>I had become pretty accomplished with Elements’ mighty Levels control,
but the combination of Lightroom’s Histogram and Tone Curve tools seems to get me
results that are about as good with a little less work, and I go off the rails
less often.</p>
<p>Your working area is in the middle, and there’s a library photo-strip
across the bottom, then there are tabs full of controls on the left and
right.  You can make the tabs go away (they reappear on mouse-over, like the
Dock’s auto-hide)  and I usually do.</p>
<p>Getting into full-screen mode is a single keystroke.   There’s another
keystroke, “L” which turns the lights out; that is to say, in a couple of
strokes all of the GUI is greyed then blacked out, leaving only your picture.
Mmm, tasty.  And hey, keystroke controls with no command- or control- or
anything.</p>
<p>There’s a nice side-by-side compare-two-pictures mode.</p>
<p>It’s really good at remembering what you just did, so you very rarely have
to type in something more than once when you want to do it again.</p>
<p>It looks just amazingly wonderful on my big 25" Sun monitor.</p>
<p>It’s easy to learn.  I keep meaning to get around to looking at the Getting
Started material, but haven’t yet.</p>
<p>Did I mention it’s really fast?</p>

<title>Twitter, Rails, Seaside, Respect</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>If you’re obsessive about dynamic languages and Web frameworks (and who
isn’t?) it’s been a juicy few days.  Let’s start with a bunch of
pointers:
Mike Pence
<a href="http://blog.caboo.se/articles/2007/4/8/heresy-and-turtles-all-the-way-down-with-avi-bryant">interviews
Avi Bryant &amp; tries to start a fight</a>.  Avi
<a href="http://smallthought.com/avi/?p=21">says “huh?”</a>.  DHH too,
<a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000609.html">in his own space</a> and
<a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2007/04/no-compromise-stateful-row">an InfoQ
interview</a>.
At the same time, a Twitter developer
<a href="http://www.radicalbehavior.com/5-question-interview-with-twitter-developer-alex-payne/">disses
Rails</a>.  DHH
<a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000608.html">says smart things</a>
and so do
<a href="http://laughingmeme.org/2007/04/12/twitter-ruby-and-scaling/">Kellan
of LaughingMeme</a> and
<a href="http://tomayko.com/weblog/2007/04/13/rails-multiple-connections">Ryan
Tomayko</a>.  Phew.  Now it’s my turn.</p>
<p>First, I was in that original Mike Pence interview (via IRC in #jruby) and
he left out what I thought was the most important thing I said: Right now,
Ruby and Rails, out of the box with not much tinkering, are plenty fast enough
for lots of applications.  I mean, <em>really a lot</em> of applications.</p>
<p>Second, as an investor in Avi’s company, there’s a chunk of my own
money that says I’m OK with Seaside.  When I first saw it, I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/12/02/On-Beyond-Java-Web">wrote a
piece</a> that asked, more or less “WTF!? Can you abstract the Web away?” and
I’d like to draw your attention to
<a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2005/12/02/For-small-values-of-the-web">Sam
Ruby’s reply</a>: “Pssst: don’t tell anyone, but this is only true for small
values of ‘the web’.”   And DabbleDB is the nicest small piece of the Web I’ve
ever seen; replicated enough times, in aggregate it won’t be small.  For great
big honkin’ Internet-facing apps that want to be platforms 
too, I’d probably push back on what Avi’s said about the unimportance of clean
URIs but, you know what?  I suspect in that context we might agree.</p>
<p>Third, I had an off-the-record conversation recently and learned a whole
bunch of things about the Twitter/Rails situation.  Holy shit, that’s a scary
load they’re trying to stand up under and there are some hurtin’
engineers.</p>
<p>But the thought I came away with was this: In the big picture, Twitter did
exactly the right thing.  They had a good idea and they buckled down and
focused on delivering something as cool as possible as fast as possible, and
it’s really hard, in early 2007, to beat Rails for that.  When
all of a sudden there were a few tens of thousands of people using it,
<em>then</em> they went to work on the scaling.</p>
<p>Oh, “Respect”.  There’s a lot of it going around, with correspondingly
little religion.  And while I think InfoQ is by and large doing good stuff;
guys, it’s a new millennium, we’re trying to re-invent journalism and maybe we
can learn to get past “if it bleeds, it leads”?</p>

<p>It’ll be back to my old stomping grounds in Waterloo in late May to do a plenary at
<a href="https://fortuna.uwaterloo.ca/canheit/">CANHEIT 2007</a>, which is the
Canadian University IT conference.  I hope to see one or two of my old compadres.</p>

<title>Upcoming Gig: RailsConf 2007</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’ll be heading to Portland, Oregon for a keynote at
<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails/">RailsConf 2007</a>, May 17-20.  I
gather that like most Ruby-related events it sold out more or less instantly.
There’s a funny story about how I came to attend.</p>
<p>What happened was, somebody at O’Reilly, who are staging the event,
contacted me wondering if Sun might like to sponsor.  The idea sounded
plausible, so I put them in touch with the right Marketing folk, and the idea
sounded plausible to them too.  The discussion involved giving a keynote, and
we had a call with
<a href="http://www.chadfowler.com/">Chad Fowler</a>, Rails and Ruby community leader, conference
chair, and all-around good guy.</p>
<p>I said that I’d love to come and give a talk about some of the technology
issues worrying me, in particular integration problems.  Rails is good but that
doesn’t mean that Java or PHP or .NET are going away, or legacy Cobol apps for
that matter, and we’re just gonna have to figure out how to make these things
play nice together, and if you don’t believe in WS-*, then what do you believe
in?</p>
<p>On the other hand, if what people wanted was a corporate keynote, along the lines
of “Sun’s products rock, we love ya, love us back” we should send a VP with some real
corporate heft.</p>
<p>Chad thought the technical session would be more interesting.  But then he
said “Uh, but you know, could you maybe talk about why Sun is all hot on Ruby
and Rails too?”   Not unreasonable, I guess.</p>

<title>FotD: April 15 Trillium</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We have a little trillium patch in the corner of the yard in an angle of the cedar
hedge where there’s not much direct light.  This is a Pacific Northwest
native; I don’t know if it’s the same plant as Ontario’s provincial flower.
I once threatened another human being with death over this these flowers.</p>
<img src="IMGP4880.jpg" alt="Trillium" />
<p>They’re pretty and really appealing; the flowers slowly shade through pink
into violet as they age.  But lots of times they don’t make it; they’re
fragile things.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago we were having the hedge trimmed (it’s a solid day’s
hard work for a professional with all the right equipment; beyond my powers).
Somebody didn’t tell the hedge guy about the trilliums, and when I came home
from work he looked at me sheepishly and admitted he’d stepped on one.</p>
<p>I was irritated but what could you do, so I said, not dressing it up.
“That’s too bad, because it’s the death penalty for that” and he looked really
taken aback for a second or two.</p>

<title>Interop Impressions and Pix</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We worked from noon till six Monday, and from 8:30 till the middle of
Tuesday; a little over twenty people in the room.
I got the Ape talking to a few and failed with a couple of others, but in those
cases the problems were implementation glitches, not the protocol.
Surprises?  I saw a couple of servers that didn’t accept Atom
entries, just various kinds of media objects.  OK, I guess.  Pleasant
surprises: getting pretty well complete interoperation with (on almost the
first try) Nikunj Mehta’s code and (after a bit of work) Kevin Beyer’s and
James Snell’s.
I’m running a few shots of the event just because I like taking pictures of
people.  I’ll write another piece drawing some technical conclusions.</p>
<p>These are all the pictures I was happy with; I particularly regret not having
decent pictures of Nikunj Mehta and <s>Lissa Dusseault</s> (got one), and especially of having
missed her adorable three-month-old.</p>

<title>How Big is the Club?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We who read (and write) blogs and play with the latest Internet Trinkets
(and build them) have been called an echo chamber, a hall of mirrors,  a teeny
geeky minority whose audience is itself.  Let me explore this notion a bit
using Twitter.</p>
<p>In March, I gave a keynote at Web Design World in
San Francisco.  Frankly, it did not go that well; in particular, the crowd
didn’t laugh at my jokes.  Here’s one of them, more or less: “Being a Web Guy
at Sun is a little intimidating.  At high level strategy meetings the Chip
Guys talk about what they’ll be shipping in 2009, and both the OS Guys and
Java Guys talk about things a year or two out.
As for us Web Guys, well... three weeks ago, I didn’t know that Twitter
would become the Hot New Thing.”</p>
<p>It became apparent that most of them
hadn’t heard of Twitter.  The same joke (I’m a slow learner) fell flat at
a meeting of University IT and Computer Science people a week later in Calgary.
So let’s take this as evidence of the insularity and smallness—and, perhaps,
unimportance—of the Internet In-crowd.</p>
<p>At the same time, we hear stories about the load on the Twitter servers
spiking to tens of thousands of requests <em>per second</em>.  The back of my
envelope seems to be telling me that the number of people who not only know
about but use Twitter is, um, enormous.</p>
<p>What do you make of it?</p>

<title>Atompub Interop Lessons</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The results are 
<a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/InteropGrid">summarized on the
Wiki</a>;
what do they mean?
Obviously, good news: The fact that people from this
many places, most of whom had never met before, got together and were able
to put that many check-marks on the grid, based on a protocol whose design is
not quite frozen, verges on the miraculous.
Now let’s dive a little deeper; what does each check-mark mean, and what can
implementors bet on, and when?</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Check or Not</h2>
<p>Standards vary.  For example, there’s one server-side API where I didn’t record
success even though I eventually managed (I think) to post a
picture, because there was just too much one-off hacking involved.  In this
particular case, I’m sure the developers are clueful and will fix the
problems.</p>
<p>I’m dubious about the quality of a few of the check-marks in the grid;
I know some of the client guys bypassed a b0rked Service doc and just hammered
HTTP verbs at a hacked-in collection URI, which I’m pretty sure isn’t kosher.
On the other hand, the fact that I’m picky, and that I still managed a
check-mark on nine of fourteen attempts to interoperate with server
implementations, is pretty decent.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Attitude</h2>
<p>So far, the attitude around the APP is pretty pleasing.  I can clearly
remember the early days of trying to roll out one Web Standard or another, and
Netscape or Microsoft would come to the meeting and say “Yes, well we’ve
decided there would be greater value to our users in our improved version” by
which they meant “Fuck you standards wusses, we’re about grabbing
territory.”</p>
<p>Haven’t been getting much of that around the Atom Protocol.  I wonder why?
Partly because protocols are all about it taking two to tango, partly because
Atom has never sanely been accused of being a nefarious plot by one vendor or
another, maybe because as a community we’re a little older and wiser.
Anyhow, I sure appreciate it.</p>
<p>In fact, there was a lot of laughter in the room.  “Ape just went into endless-loop
mode, snicker.”  “GData just blew chunks, ha ha.”  “Roller’s got null-byte
cancer again, hee hee.”  It’s the only way engineers stay sane, see
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/08/18/Borked">47 ways</a>.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Authentication</h2>
<p>It’s gonna be a problem.  See
<a href="http://www.snellspace.com/wp/?p=637">James Snell</a>.
I think I’m going to have to write more on the subject.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>The Implementation Space</h2>
<p>It’s become pretty obvious that a pretty broad range of pieces of software
can fairly claim to to be Atompub implementations.  This is more obvious on
the server than on the client side, partly because the implementations are
more numerous and mature at this point.</p>
<p>Some are clearly not general-purpose; for example, the O’Reilly people at
the Interop event had what appeared to be a perfectly legal
implementation; but you could only post DocBook XML to it.
Which I can see being useful for them, but a vanilla blogging client probably
won’t work that well with it, out of the box.</p>
<p>In the short term, I’m personally most interested in mainstream servers
that a general-purpose blogging client (like the kind you’d expect to find in
a mobile phone, hint hint) could use easily.  So that’s the space the Ape explores.</p>
<p>If you check that interop grid, the columns with check-marks in Row 1
are implementations that in my opinion could probably be used by a generic
blogging client pretty well right out of the box.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Heterogeneity</h2>
<p>Technologies represented: Perl, Python, PHP, Ruby, Java, C#; DB2, Oracle,
MySQL, Derby, flat files;  Linux, Windows, OS X, Solaris.   Spot the pattern?</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>APP When?</h2>
<p>So, Joe Cheng of Microsoft, on the Live team and an impressive guy, looked me
in the eye and said “When can I ship an APP client and be safe?”  Which is a
really hard question and 100% totally fair.  I can’t make any promises, but
what I said was “July” and I think that’s safe.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>The Big Lesson</h2>
<p>Sun and IBM and Oracle have working database-backed Atom stores.  Microsoft
and IBM, that we know of, have in-progress clients.  Judging
by my email, there are
a bunch of startups hacking together one side or another of the protocol.
Draw your own conclusions, but I think it’s obvious.</p>

implementation to play nice with Hiroshi Asakura’s NTT server-side, so I asked
him to send me his WSSE client code.  I eventually got it to work (not 100%
sure how) but at one point I was peering closely at Hiroshi’s code and
thinking “What does <em>that</em> do?” and realized I wasn’t sure what
programming language I was reading.  Then I realized it didn’t really matter,
they all look more and more like each other.  It turned out to be C#.</p>

<title>Big, Big Iron</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Yesterday April 17th we did a great big honking announcement about servers,
er make that an announcement about great big honking servers.  Frankly, I
know pretty well zilch about this class of machine; I can relate to Web pumps
like the
T1000/T2000, and to an x86 meat-grinder like the X4100 (which an irritated little bird
working for one of our customers just told me that you can’t buy at the
moment because they’re sold out); but these supertanker-scale things we cooked
up with Fujitsu are from another planet.  I went poking around
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com">blogs.sun.com</a> looking for something
hands-on.  Bingo (but, er, anonymous bingo, which irritates me; I’ve expressed
my opinion on this internally).  First,
“EXOTERIC” was down in the trenches with Fujitsu and the iron, see
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/exoteric/entry/new_sun_fujitsu_sparc_enterprise">New Sun-Fujitsu SPARC Enterprise Systems</a>.
Second, “BM Seer” fires a volley of benchmarks:

<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/bmseer/entry/sun_sparc_enterprise_m8000_sparc64">bang</a>.
I may not grok the finer points of mainframe technology but you can follow pointers
from the announcement to the 
<a href="http://www.sun.com/servers/highend/m9000/index.xml">M9000</a> and
look at the heavy-metal

<p>This bush, Alex Waterhouse-Hayward told me upon hearing its description, is
a Japanese Azalea; distinguished by vanishing, when it’s in full bloom, behind
a solid mass of blossoms.  When so covered it requires substantially greater
skill than mine to photograph because the all that red overloads the camera.
But at the moment it’s tractable.</p>

<title>Whither IT?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There are a couple of browser tabs I’ve had open for at least a week now
and they’ve been making me think and I think they’re related but I still don’t
have a synthesis.  The first is Bill de hÓra’s
<a href="http://www.dehora.net/journal/2007/04/and_so_it_goes.html">Matchstick
Men</a>, which says a bunch of smart things about WS-* and REST, but that’s
not what resonates, it’s this: <i>Critically the upkeep and maintenance of
legacy systems has come to dominate business software spending. Most large
enterprise IT divisions now have the equivalent of a pensions fund crisis,
except that all the money is being spent on old systems instead of old
people.</i>  The second is Nicholas Carr’s
<a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/04/citi_whacks_it.php">Citi
whacks IT</a>, from begins: <i>In yet another sign of the vast amount of waste
inherent in big-company IT operations...</i>.</p>
<p>Clearly these two pieces are related, and I may not have a synthesis but I
do have take-aways.  First, Citi’s scope to slash is limited if, as Bill
suggests, most of their spending is based on “supported living” for legacy
apps.  Sure, they can stack apps on fewer boxes via virtualization, but it’s
not the boxes that cost the big bucks, these days.</p>
<p>Second, Citi’s stated strategy of “standardizing how the company develops,
deploys and runs applications” seems to me like a recipe for stagnation and
bureaucracy.  Such a strategy would have led to fight-back in the
Eighties against the PC and in the Nineties against the Web; any decent
business strategy has to leave enough wiggle room for the discovery of its
successor.</p>
<p>But the real take-away is this, and it’s something that worries me more and
more.  I’m convinced that, increasingly, the proportion of enterprise software
development based on dynamic languages and AMP technologies and Rails and
rapid-iteration continuous-beta “Web 2.0” thinking will increase for the
foreseeable future.  But that doesn’t mean that Java or .NET or even COBOL are
going 
away, and the brutal truth is that we don’t really don’t have anything like
industry consensus on the best practices for integrating Rails and PHP and
Java EE and .NET/SQLServer and Cobol/IMS and Ada and all the other weird old
shit that’s out 
there doing boring vital business functions.</p>
<p>Me, I think the best bet is something REST-flavored, but we’re kinda short of
tooling and best practices and experience.  I think this problem is urgent.</p>

<p>It’s about the beauty in the volleyball players’ faces.  While this is

even if you don’t care about sports or cameras, you owe it to yourself to go
check out
<a href="http://www.robgalbraith.com/public_files/eos-1d_mark_III_slideshow/index.html">this
slide show</a>, which an astounding piece of reportage, damn the medium.
For the camera geeks, the slideshow is illustrative material from
<a href="http://www.robgalbraith.com/bins/multi_page.asp?cid=7-8738-8908">Rob Galbraith’s write-up</a> 
on Canon’s all-out assault on the state of the digicam art with their EOS-1D
Mark III.
But that’s not the magic.  The magic is from 
<a href="http://theonlinephotographer.blogspot.com/">The Online
Photographer</a>, a highly recommended photogeek blog, in particular the
“Featured Comment” from Matthew Miller down at the bottom of 
<a href="http://theonlinephotographer.blogspot.com/2007/04/so-you-thought-you-had-good-buffer.html">So You Thought You Had Good Buffer Depth</a>,
and it asks a question: Why does a digital camera need a lens, anyhow?  A lens
is an expensive inflexible analog computer that locks you into one
focal-length setting.  If you capture the photons hitting the front of the
lens, shouldn’t you be able to figure out the best focus later?
Or has Mr. Miller got something wrong in the basic physics?</p>

<p>So, in no particular order:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>It’s helped improve Sun’s image.  Three years ago we were seen as a
big faceless lawyer-bound monolith; now the world sees that this is in fact an
unruly tribe of people, many of them really bright, maniacally focused
on the tech and biz of IT.</p></li>
<li><p>Executives love being able to get their message out without having to
route it through a journalist’s or analyst’s filtering function.</p></li>
<li><p>We keep hearing anecdotal stories from salespeople about being able
to get in front of some prospect, or route around some obstacle, because of
something someone read on one of the blogs.</p></li>
<li><p>We listen better.  Like Bill Joy said, “Wherever you work, most of the
smart people are somewhere else.”  If I’m a smart person in Cleveland or
Shanghai or Warsaw or Lima and I get a bright idea about something Sun should
be doing, or notice with horror that Sun is doing something stupid, there’s no
obvious way for an individual to 
talk to a big California computer company.  On the other hand, if I’m reading
some Sun blogger who writes about what I care about and I know the
<i>first.last@sun.com</i> rule, it’s the work of minutes to fire off an
email. I get these all the time and I bet there are a hundred or two a month,
in aggregate across the bloggers.</p></li>
<li><p>The morale-boost has been tremendous.  Right at the moment, less than
10% of the workforce are actually committed bloggers to the extent of posting
once a week or more; but the uplift from knowing that if you have something to
say, it’s OK with the company for you to just go and say it to the world,
that’s huge.  Ask anyone who works here.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id='p-3'>Downsides?</h2>
<p>Really, it’s hard to come up with one.  B.s.c. doesn’t cost much to run,
nobody’s been fired that I know of, and while we have one or two minor
flame-wars a year on the internal bloggers’ mailing list, it’s all quite
civilized.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure that in another half-generation or so, a company that
<em>doesn’t</em> do blogging is going to look weird and maybe a little
shady.</p>

<title>Canon A710 IS</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A couple of contributors wanted me to say something about the little Canon
I bought in late March.  So here are some notes.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to like about it.  It’s pretty small and the fact that it
runs on two ordinary AA batteries makes it lighter, and easy to
refuel wherever you find yourself.  Its white-balance guesswork is pretty
savvy and its sharpening
is understated and, to be brutally honest, the software in the camera comes
close to the best I can do with Lightroom and the Pentax’s RAW files.</p>
<p>It’s got tons of zoom and works well one-handed and has a pretty good LCD
on the back.</p>
<p>A few of the 150 or so pictures I’ve taken with it have been good enough
for <span class='o'>ongoing</span>; here are a few more, of the “yank out
the camera and shoot without thinking” school.</p>

<h2 id='p-2'>Downside</h2>
<p>My only gripe is that I don’t really trust the full-automatic mode because,
unlike any previous camera I’ve owned, it has auto-ISO and on interior shots
tends to crank the ISO so the picture’s nice and
bright but hopelessly grainy.  Still, you can leave it in “Program” mode and
get pretty well all the benefits of full-auto.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Summing Up</h2>
<p>It fits in the pocket, it gets out of the way, it takes decent pictures of
most things I point it at.  I’ve been passionately fond of some cameras
and loathed others; I don’t have any feelings to speak of about this one, but
the price was fair and it does what I ask.</p>

<title>Pentax smc P-DA 40mm “Pancake”</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I went to
<a href="http://www.leoscamera.com/">Leo’s Camera</a> here in Vancouver
because it’s 
<a href="http://alexwaterhousehayward.com/">Alex Waterhouse-Hayward’s</a> fave
and because I wanted a look at the Leica M8.  The Leica was sold out but I saw
this lens I just had to buy.  It’s adorable, now we’ll see how it works.
<i>[Update: Tossed in a couple of pictures.]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Prime Lenses</h2>
<p>These days, most people take most of their pictures, either with pocket
cams or SLRs, using a zoom lens.  The term “prime lens” refers to any lens
that’s not a zoom, and is usually applied to ordinary fixed-focal-length
lenses that are neither telephotos nor wide-angles.</p>
<p>There’s a cost for that zoom technology; prime lenses are typically a
little “faster” (which is to say, let in a little more light) and the
glass is optimized for exactly one field of view, so you can expect a
little more sharpness and vividness.  Of course, you have to compose your shot
by moving the camera around, and if it’s too far away you’re just not gonna
get it.</p>
<p>But lots of photographers find something about shooting with a prime lens
addictive, and I’m one of them.  Pretty well all those recent
<a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=intitle%3Afotd+site%3Atbray.org">Flower
of the day</a> shots were with a prime lens; to be precise, the very ordinary
50mm that came with the old Pentax film camera all those years ago.</p>
<p>Which got me some OK pictures, but it doesn’t do auto-focus and the glass is
optimized for 35mm film not the 23.5x15.7mm CCD.  It turns out that there’s
progress in analog technology as well as digital; Pentax has a line of “DA”
lenses that are optimized for their DSLRs and among other things are smaller.</p>
<p>The 40mm P-DA is <em>tiny</em>.  It comes with this ultra-clever
lens-cap/shield combo.  The cap has a little secondary cap you can screw out,
leaving the shield.  See the pictures below, shot on top of a piano so half of
the lens you think you see is reflection.</p> 
<img src="IMG_0173.jpg" alt="Pentax smc P-DA 40mm" />
<img src="IMG_0174.jpg" alt="Pentax smc P-DA 40mm" />
<p>It seems minuscule on the camera; so cute you want to
tickle it under its adorable little chin.</p>
<img src="IMG_0176.jpg" alt="Pentax *ist-D DSLR with smc P-DA 40mm lens" />
<p>You can see why they call it a “pancake”.  The whole rig is smaller and
lighter.  I’m off on a business trip next week and I think I’ll take the SLR
along.  Which is kind of the idea.</p> 
<p>There’s also an amazingly small 70mm “pancake”; I tried it out in the store
and was unconvinced; of course I’m used to the monster Tamron 70-210.  Also it
was twice as expensive as this little cutiepie.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Initial Verdict</h2>
<p>The auto-focus buys time, which is terrific for shooting pictures of people
especially kids.  Flowers on the other hand hold still, so it doesn’t help
much there.  I don’t run the kids’ pictures, but here are a couple of
flowers; first, the trillium you’ve already seen, now well into its
fade-to-violet stage.  Next, a flurry of forget-me-nots; nothing in the garden
has quite so pleasing a colour to my eye.</p>

<p>We went for early Sunday dinner at the terrace at the Jericho Sailing Club
and then of course for a walk on the pier.  On the pier was free
entertainment; 
<a href="http://www.krisholm.com/">Kris Holm</a> was having a performance
filmed.  He claims to 
be the world’s best known Mountain Unicyclist, a category that’s new to
me.  I got a few pictures.</p>
<p>His technique was pretty impressive; cycling along the narrow top of the pier
railings and working his way around 90° turns; leaping the unicycle from one
railing to another, and hurtling to ground from way up in the air.</p>

was hurtling down a railing directly toward me.</p>
<p>When we were leaving the pier I thought “Oh, of course” and hurried back
and called out to where he was perched up on the pier, saying “Hey, got a web
site?  I have a blog, mind if I run a picture and link?”</p>

<p>With notes this week on hippies, raconteurs, the M8 controversy, and a dead
Russian.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Hippies</h2>
<p>When you think about all the subcultures that have streamed by over the
decades, mostly they come and go; but in each new young generation a certain
small proportion, it seems, wants to be hippies.  It’s no longer reasonable to
be a beatnik or a 
punk of the old style, and I doubt that the goths or emos will make it much
out of this decade, but the hippies seem to self-renew.</p>
<p>This was brought to mind when last week I visited friend &amp; IETF
colleague
<a href="http://lookit.typepad.com/">Paul Hoffman</a> in his Santa Cruz digs;
we went for a walk to the Farmers’ Market, which was pretty well Hippie
Central.  I particularly liked the T-shirt that said <i>Keep Santa Cruz
Weird</i>.  The food on sale looked scrumptious; I wanted to buy lots but I
figured the Canada Customs people at the airport might have an issue.
Here’s a picture of some salad pre-mix with edible flowers; all-organic of
course.</p>
<img src="IMG_0162.jpg" alt="Salad pre-mix with edible flowers from the Santa Cruz Farmers’ Market" />
<p>The only big change over many decades since I was a hippie is that a
certain proportion of them are now rastas as well, which is logical enough.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Camera has No Clothes</h2>
<p>For the best part of a year, the photo-geek community has been gathered in
a circle gazing inward at the
<a href="http://www.leica-camera.us/photography/m_system/m8/">Leica M8</a>;
it’s insanely expensive, a rangefinder not a SLR, and acknowledged to be
quirky.  Oddly, serious reviews from serious publications have been thin.
Suspicion is afoot that this because they don’t like saying nasty things about
expensive flagship products.  Well, Mike Johnston of <cite>The Online
Photographer</cite> has done a medium-deep dive and wrote a two-parter
<a href="http://theonlinephotographer.blogspot.com/2007/04/leica-m8-pro-and-con-pro_6765.html"> Leica M8 Pro and Con: Pro</a>
and 
<a href="http://theonlinephotographer.blogspot.com/2007/04/leica-m8-pro-and-con-con.html">Leica M8 Pro and Con: Con</a>.
If you’re a camera geek, you probably want to read these.</p>
<p>My understanding of the Leica value proposition was a smallish, lightish,
<em>really</em> fast-shooting camera with good optics.  Which would suit my
style just fine; none of the pictures I take that I like are planned.  I’m
beginning to think 
that one of the smaller DSLRs, equipped with a couple of the smaller lenses,
like for example the teeny Pentax 40mm
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/04/27/Pentax-P-DA-40mm">I just bought</a> and
perhaps its 
<a href="http://www.pentaximaging.com/products/product_details/camera_lens--smc_P-DA_21mm_F3.2_AL_Limited/reqID--7878390/subsection--Digital_35mm_wide_angle">21mm
wide-ish angle</a> companion are about the best support my photo-habit is
going to get.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Raconteurs</h2>
<p>I actually mean
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Raconteurs">The Raconteurs</a>, Jack
White (of the White Stripes) collaborating with Brendan Benson and friends.
I caught them playing a half-hour set on TV and was really knocked out; going
to have to get their record.  Well, maybe their rendition of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bang_Bang_%28My_Baby_Shot_Me_Down%29">Bang
Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)</a> was a little over the top; actually it was a
<em>lot</em> over the top, but I’m not sure it 100% worked.  But they played
some nice ballad-y stuff and a crisply violent straight-ahead rocker and a
completely deranged blues that kept veering between free jazz and Led Zep’s
<cite>Since I’ve Been Loving You</cite>.  Jack White makes his guitar do a
lot of things and we disagree on whether some of them actually constitute
music, but still, the song was really something special.</p>

<title>REST, as in Take It Easy</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Microsoft coding guru
<a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/tewald/">Tim Ewald</a> got a lot of
people talking when he announced
<a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/tewald/archive/2007/04/26/46984.aspx">I
finally get REST. Wow.</a> and followed up with
<a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/tewald/archive/2007/04/28/47067.aspx">Three reasons that REST is not RPC</a>.
It’s nice that the word is spreading, but many REST converts see complicated
magic where I see a few simple easy-to-understand virtues.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Naming Things</h2>
<p>People don’t recognize how important URIs are.  The notion that you have a
huge, world-scale, information space, and that everything in it has an
name and they’re all just short strings that you can paint on the side
of a bus; 
that’s a new thing and a good thing.</p>
<p>REST theoreticians make extravagant claims about hypermedia,
but it seems to me that computer programs have always needed to refer
to things, and computer programs that send messages have always needed to put
those references in the messages.  URIs just provided a <em>uniform</em> way to
do this, and it was easier and less complicated and shared across all
applications that wanted to play in Web-space.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Messages All The Way Down</h2>
<p>HTTP is a decent and under-appreciated protocol, but in the end maybe the
most important thing is that it forces you to think about the messages and how
you exchange them.  There’s no pretense that Remote Procedures are being
called, or Object Models are being shared; I send you some bits and some
metadata about them, and you respond with the same.  It turns out that in the
HTTP universe, at that point our conversation
is over, and that turns out to be a good basis for building applications, but
the key thing is putting the messages, rather than what they allegedly stand
for, at the center.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Yummy Protocol Goodness</h2>
<p>I don’t know if there were any other explicitly message-centric protocols
in play when HTTP came along; if not, we’re lucky that it hit so many sweet
spots.</p>
<p>For example, it turns out that HTTP being one-request-one-response forces
you to think explicitly about state and where it should live; there’s no one
correct answer to that question (yes, cookies are OK sometimes), but
applications where the designers had to think about it are generally better
than the other kind</p>
<p>Another sweet spot is the absence of URI metadata and the closely-coupled
“404 Not Found”.  The only way to find out what a URI identifies is to try to
retrieve it, and it’s perfectly OK if the network says “I dunno”.  Because
that’s how the world is, and protocols that map the world accurately are
generally better than those that don’t.</p>
<p>Then there’s the notion of dividing all the transactions into three
buckets: commitment-free (GET), idempotent-update (PUT/DELETE), and Other
(POST).  Hard to argue with and theory, and the GET and POST parts are
well-proved in practice.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Theory is OK</h2>
<p>I think
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">Roy’s thesis</a> is an outstanding piece of work, but it’s important to
remember that he worked on the software first, for years, and at some level
REST is a an attempt to retroactively paste a layer of respectable theory over
some stuff that happened to work. For my money, that’s the best kind of
theory; but the real truth is in the software, which works really well.</p>
<p>So if Tim Ewald wants to think about his apps as State Machines, and if
someone else wants to think of them as Hypermedia Platforms, and someone else
as a Contribution Commons, that’s well and good.  But at the end of the day
it’s about having good ways to name things and a clean simple message-centric
protocol that’s not trying to pretend to be something else.</p>

<body>
<p>I spent the week in London.  Fun was had, pictures were taken, I learned
things.
Herewith illustrated notes on transportation,
energy, finance technology, businesslike drinking, women’s clothing, Groovy,
excellent lamb-chop curry, and a round red anomaly.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Travel</h2>
<p>Damn, it’s a long way, and I can’t help thinking about the enormous carbon
footprint.  Also, there’s just no way to travel
these kinds of distances without your butt and brain hurting when you arrive.</p> 
<p>After flying across the Arctic and Atlantic for hours and hours, you see the
first Hebrides and soon are over the lush greens (and at this time of year,
yellows) of the heart of England.</p>
<img src="IMG_0191.jpg" alt="Islands at the extreme North-West of the Hebrides" />
<img src="IMG_0194-Edit.jpg" alt="The English countryside in green and yellow" />
<p>On this trip I was talking to people in the finance business, which means
London’s “City” and then Canary Wharf, which means trains and taxis and walking;
it’s really efficient but boy do your feet get tired.</p>
<p>Most people have had the long-subway-escalator experience, but I still
can’t get over it when I haven’t done it for a while.</p>
<img src="IMGP5158.jpg" alt="London subway escalator" />
<p>Of course, not all of the Tube is white and modern and gleamy;
Farringdon station of a late evening can’t look much different than it did
fifty years ago.</p>
<img src="IMGP5156.jpg" alt="Farringdon station by night, London subway" />
<p>The City is at the north end of London Bridge.  My hotel was at
the south end, right beside the medium-large train station.  The
bridge has rush hours; here’s the homeward herd six-ish on a weeknight.</p>
<img src="IMG_0196.jpg" alt="The rush-hour crowd walking south across London Bridge" />
<p>On Friday morning as I was coming into work, there was an anomaly.
I was waiting for it to take off, but it just sat there.  Then I saw the
camera crews filming it; a T-Mobil commercial perhaps?</p>
<img src="IMG_0204.jpg" alt="Anomalous red balloon on London Bridge" />
<h2 id='p-2'>Booze</h2>
<p>Posting my travel plans here worked out really well; I got an invite to the
London Java Meetup on Tuesday night, a
<a href="http://fiteclub.org/">Fite Club</a> meeting Wednesday, and dinner
with a friend on Thursday.  Thank you all for having me.</p>
<p>When British business colleagues get together after work, what they do is
go to a pub and drink lots of beer for two or three hours; <em>then</em> they 
get something to eat.  Which is not what I’m used to, but when in Rome... mind
you, three pints on an empty stomach when you’re just a few hours off a
ten-hour red-eye flight can lead to unwarranted enthusiasm.
My low-light camera technique still needs lots of work, but here’s a shot from
the Java 
Meetup.</p>
<img src="IMGP5148.jpg" alt="London Java Meetup at a pub near Farringdon" />
<p>Thanks for the beers and the good company, guys.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Groovy</h2>
<p>At that event I met Jeremy Rayner, a heavy Java geek and one of the Groovy
conspirators.  Unlike some groovyists I could mention, he didn’t explain how
Sun owed the language love and money, nor did I get any static about how only
Groovy could really integrate with Java.</p>
<p>But he did tell me some
interesting stories about how it’s being to work at
<a href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/speaker_topic_view.jsp?topicId=571">Mutual
of Omaha</a> and
<a href="http://grails.org/PepsiCo+Grails+Sites+Post-Analysis">PepsiCo</a>
and, well, watch
<a href="http://grails.org/Testimonials">here</a> or
<a href="http://grails.org/Success+Stories">here</a>.
Then, later on in the week, I was presenting to a room-full of senior Java
developers from a bank whose name you’d recognize and it turns out they’ve got
thousands of lines of Groovy in production: “It buys us flexibility and
productivity.”
Methinks we may have a phenomenon building.
Earth to Groovy community: Do evangelism like Jeremy does.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Hadoop</h2>
<p>Also at the pub was Tom White, who’s a 
<a href="http://lucene.apache.org/hadoop/about.html">Hadoop</a> Committer and 
<a href="http://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</a> PMC
Member. I know, because that’s what it says on his business
card; in fact, that’s <em>all</em> it says, except for his name and email
address.  I call that stylish.</p>
<p>Hadoop was one of the things I was suggesting that the finance
folk I met with should be looking at.  We need new approaches
to get good mileage out of increasingly-concurrent processors, and this Java
implementation of Google’s map/reduce is a <em>very</em> interesting
direction.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Canary Wharf</h2>
<p>This is the synthetic financial district built East of downtown
London by Canada’s Reichmann brothers (it’s a colourful story; they built it,
they got into business trouble, they went bust, they eventually rebounded, and
then they bought it back).  It is brutal, entirely without charm or warmth.
On the other hand, the Finance-centric parts of London, both the Wharf and the
City, are distinguished by swarms of <em>extremely</em> well-dressed women; 
some of the fashion statements were totally new to me and really worked.
The men?  Pinstripes, yawn.  My vest and black Akubra failed to fit in.</p>
<p>Arriving at the Wharf with the morning rush is mind-boggling;
the subway trains are packed to the max; when they unload there are thousands
of people in sharp dark clothing streaming through the vast cavernous
spaces then crowding single-file onto 
the long threadlike escalators up to where the money is.  
I couldn’t help thinking of a swarm of
ants lining up to climb a stick to get at something yummy.</p>  
<p>I got a couple of pictures inside, which
totally failed to capture the sense of space and the ant-hill feeling.
But here’s a shot of the subway station entrance

interesting parts of the picture.</p>

<p>On the way to dinner with
<a href="http://kontrawize.blogs.com/kontrawize/">Tony Coates</a> and family
Thursday, I got a couple of shots
of the Wharf.  Thank you for the evening, Tony and Daniela and the boy; it was
a really refreshing break in the week.</p>

<p>A senior technologist working for a bank whose name you’d
recognize told me that there are major infrastructure problems; right now, the
mains delivering electrical power to the Wharf are maxed right out and there’s
no ETA for bringing in more juice.  He’s got a hiring freeze in one 
building, even though there’s space and budget, because they can’t power up
any more PCs.  Hey, 
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/enviro/">Dave Douglas</a>, they need your help!</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>More Booze</h2>
<p>The Fite Club meeting was out at the wharf, and I learned a whole lot of
useful things; among others, that this gang is generally un-seduced by the WS-*
pitch and is actively thinking about the RESTful alternatives. Hey vendors,
time to start tooling up.</p>
<p>After several gallons of beer apiece at a synthetic-Olde-Englishe Canary
Wharf pub,
<a href="http://blog.nggrid.com/">Ken Horn</a> proclaimed a magic word:
“Curry!”  
So he and George and I went
off to the Lahore Kebab
House in East London.  The decor was, shall we say, extremely
<em>sincere</em>—I particularly enjoyed the big flat-screen TV tuned to
Bollywood.
The people were friendly and efficient and the food was really good, starting
with the raita to dip the appetizers in.
Especially the lamb chops with curry; spicy and maybe a bit greasy and I think
the best dish I’ve had so far in 2007.  I have no idea what the address is but
picture below should help you find it if you’re in town,
and if you’re in town I totally recommend it.  It’s cheap, too (well, by
London standards).  Don’t forget to stop at the off-license next door to load
up on beer, just the thing with all the hot stuff.</p>
<img src="IMGP5162.jpg" alt="The Lahore Kebab house, East London" />
<h2 id='p-7'>Finance Technology and Web 2.0</h2>
<p>I was there more or less as the ambassador from (sigh) “Web 2.0”.  The
finance business is all about information handling; unlike most modern big
businesses, they employ legions of developers to build applications in-house,
and they push the limits of the systems to the max.  I learned a bunch of
fascinating details, but what happens in Canary Wharf stays in
Canary Wharf.</p>
<p>My messages: First, an information-centric business needs to
think a lot about life in a world where the information flows
from the edge to the centre; either they figure out how to get out in front
and leverage it, or they run the risk of being disintermediated and hollowed
out.</p>
<p>Second, that no matter how maniacally focused on performance you are, you
can’t ignore the time-to-market advantages we’re seeing from modern Web
frameworks; if my app gets to market before yours, it just might not end up
mattering that yours runs faster on the same hardware.</p>
<p>Technical professionals in the finance business are well-housed, well-paid,
and well-supported.  I’ll close with an interior/exterior shot taken at
another famous bank. I was a little worried that when I pulled out the
camera, security ninjas would erupt from the greenery and rip my
throat out, but nobody seemed to mind.</p>

<title>OpenID at Work</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>On both the Internet and behind the firewall, the identity problem gets
uglier every year. How many passwords do you have?  If you’re in IT, how much
pain do you go through getting your all your apps to share a notion of who
someone is?  There are a lot of smart people working on these problems, but
progress has been crushingly slow.  We’re doing
<a href="http://developers.sun.com/identity/">a little something 
with OpenID</a> this week
that won’t turn the world inside out but I think shows that progress is
possible.</p>
<p>OpenID (see
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/02/24/OpenID">my previous write-up</a>) is a
cheap-and-cheerful easy-to-implement way to bind an identity to a URI.
It allows a Web site talking to a browser to look at the URI and reliably
ask its server to confirm (or not) that the person behind the browser has
OpenID rights to the URI.  
It’s simple, straightforward, and it works.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, at the moment, it isn’t good for much, because the OpenID
might be pointing at a server that’s evil or silly.  It’s good enough for blog
comments and that’s about it.</p>
<p>Sun’s an Internet company and so the Identity cabal here really likes
OpenID’s notion of using a URI for an identifier.  The experts here think
there’s a whole lot more to the identity problem than that, but it still feels
like a good start.  (Bear in mind that one of Sun’s most successful product
areas is Identity software, in the directory and access-manager space).
So we’re doing an announcement today that says, more or less, “We like OpenID
and we’re going to start supporting it more.”</p>
<p>What’s more interesting is that we’re rolling out an OpenID provider,
but with a twist:  You can’t get an OpenID there unless
you’re a Sun employee, and if someone offers an OpenID whose URI is there, and
it authenticates, you can be really sure that they’re a Sun employee.
It doesn’t tell you their name or address or anything else; that’s up to the
individual to provide (or not).
The authentication relies on our Access Manager product, and it’s pretty
strong; employees here have to use those crypto-magic SecureCard token
generators for serious authentication, passwords aren’t good enough.</p>
<p>The applications are obvious; if anyone wants to offer deals or special
treatment online to Sun employees, well, that’s easy now.
(I know of at least one company named after a fruit whose online store offers
a nice Sun employee discount based on knowing a “secret” URL; this would have
to be a <em>much</em> better alternative).</p>
<p>I suspect there are a few other problems like that. At last Java One I was
talking to a CIO from a big community college with tens of thousands of
students, and literally dozens of external partners who wanted
to be able to verify that someone behind a browser was in fact a student; this
would take care of that cheaply, neatly, and safely.</p>
<p>What’s probably more interesting in the big picture is that
<code>openid.sun.com</code> shows that OpenID can be put to work on something
with actual business value.</p>
<p>The technology is pretty interesting too.  Our Access Manager product is a
big, mature, enterprise-scale offering, but that group really hadn’t imagined
an application like this, so there was quite a bit of engineering involved in
getting it to talk OpenID to the Web at large.  But it works now, and I’m
hoping one of the developers will blog the details.
It’ll be open source, of course.</p>
<p>This does <em>not</em> mean the Identity nut has been cracked, in the big
picture.  But I’m a huge fan of solutions to big problems that start out
small, simple, and efficient; this qualifies.</p>

<title>Rails Lessons</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’ve been talking recently to traditional Java
EE shops about “Web 2.0” in general and modern Web development frameworks in
particular and Rails in particular particular.  What I’ve ended up saying
(speaking only for myself, this isn’t Sun dogma) is along these lines: “Rails
isn’t going to sweep the other Web technologies away.  But those other
technologies are learning its lessons; so it’s worth checking
out.”</p>
<p>One symptom is the flow of new frameworks crossing my radar as
regular as clockwork, advertising themselves as Rails-beating.  I’m prepared to
believe that some might be;
Rails was the first to hit its particular sweet spot, but the ecosystem has
lots of room for invention and growth.</p>
<p>This week, I was particularly taken by the cheery charms of the
<a href="http://liftweb.net/"><i>lift</i> Web Framework</a>, whose pitch
begins “<i>lift</i> is yet another web development framework...”  They say it
performs 6 times faster than Rails (not five, not seven, but six).
Must be good, then.</p>

<title>Design of the Century?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>From time to time, the <cite>Economist</cite>, to which I subscribe,
pesters me to take an online survey, and sometimes I do (particularly if I’m
on a boring 
telecon).  This week I did one that veered into issues of design—there was one
question that showed interiors of four sample apartments and asked
which one I’d pick for a rental.  Then there was a question that I thought was
fairly astounding: <i>What do you think is the Twentieth Century’s most iconic
piece of design; write in your answer and an explanation</i>.  
<i>[Updated: I added my candidate, with a picture.  One commenter
agreed.]</i></p>
<p><a href="http://superboreen.blogspot.com/">Superboreen</a> was the
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/05/09/Iconic#c1178827334.805253">first</a>
to suggest what I answered: The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_guitar">electric guitar</a> in
general, the
<a href="http://www.fender.com/">Fender</a>
electric guitar in particular, and especially the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fender_Stratocaster">Fender Stratocaster</a>.</p>

<a href="http://www.fender.com/products/search.php?section=guitars&amp;cat=telecaster">Telecaster</a> in the middle.  On the bottom is the “Jeff Beck signature”
model.</p></div>
<p>The electric guitar first appeared in recorded music in 1938 and by the
middle of the century had be come the dominant instrumental timbre in most of
the world’s most popular music in general, and Rock &amp; Roll in particular.
The design is beautiful, functional, and 
flexible, and that shape has come to stand for many things in many minds, among them, Rock
&amp; Roll itself.
Which is what I call “iconic”.</p>

<title>Which “One”?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>At the beginning of the week now ending was
<a href="http://developers.sun.com/events/communityone/">Community One</a>,
an opening act or a curtain-raiser or a prelude or whatever for Java One.  I
was on stage twice, once in the opening, and managed to visit (I think) all of
the tracks.  I was one of three thousand or so people there.
It’s taken me a few days to figure out what I think about it.</p>
<p>Community One is hard to think about because there wasn’t, at the end of
the day (or the beginning, either), a unifying theme; there were a bunch
of Sun- and Java-related open-source project meet-ups, plus some other stuff
the Sun community cares about, and the Redmonk Unconference.</p>
<p>Weirdly, it worked pretty well.  While I bet that most of the people were
drawn by one track or another, I saw a lot of traffic moving back and forth
between them.  Plus, there were super-interesting hallway
conversations.</p>
<p>I think Community One needs to exist.  Clearly Sun’s software spectrum
is extending out to be bigger than Java; and we need to get together to talk
about it.
On the other hand, it would be stupid to try to rip the Java
portion of the spectrum out of the middle and segregate it;
because the success of nearly every Java developer depends
crucially on a few of the other Community One technologies.</p>
<p>So, in the big picture, does Java One become a component of Community
One?  That’s not unthinkable, but realistically, both out in the world and
inside Sun, Java remains the single largest developer community; so what’s
the tail and what’s the dog?</p>
<p>I am pretty sure of one thing: both Community One and Java One would
benefit from aggressively adopting the Unconference format for a big chunk of
the program.  Every year, in the opening plenary, John Gage exhorts the
attendees to make use of the time to get to know each other, to talk to
strangers, to hear new stories.  So why is that crucial part of the
conversation relegated to the hallways and lunch-tables?</p>
<p>Obviously, nobody’s ever tried an Unconference at the scale of Java One,
and there’ll be compromises and stumbles and the requirement for real
interaction-design creativity.  But there is low-hanging fruit:
a lot of really bright people facing really hard interesting problems
who’ve been spending too long, at this kind of event, sitting in the dark
listening.  I want to hear their stories.</p>

<title>Catchy Tune</title>

<p>The boy had a few morning minutes free before we had to 
leave for school and so “Daddy, can I listen to your iPod?”   I told him to go
ahead, and then when we were heading out the door he was singing; he can
carry a tune well and I knew it but couldn’t make out the song.  I asked him to
sing a little louder: <i>Perverts in the sun... perving everyone...</i>  Oops.
It turns out that the Shuffle had shuffled in some of Iggy Pop’s
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_Ring">Skull Ring</a>.  I suggested
that maybe he not sing that one at school, and realized that if the iPod is a

to be a little careful.

<title>WCF-REST</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>It’s like this: The WS-* project’s attempt to re-invent RPC and 
pretend that you can successfully take an object-model view of networked
applications looks increasingly fanciful, in the general case.  
On the other hand,
Microsoft’s Merry Men slaved away on Indigo, worked around the horrors of XSD
and WSDL, built some pretty good Visual Studio tooling, and shipped
<s>DCOM, the Next Generation</s>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Communication_Foundation">WCF</a>; now it’s the
way Windows wants to be talked to over the net.
Which is why the Java ecosystem has things like
<a href="https://wsit.dev.java.net/">WSIT</a>, built into <a href="http://jax-ws.dev.java.net/">JAX-WS</a>;
you may not like Windows but everyone has to talk to it.</p>
<p>Thus, I find a certain irony in the recent flurry of narrative from
WCF insiders on the virtues of REST, the centrality of the URI, and the
advantages of using GET whenever you can.  
And it’s not just talk, it’s manifesting in
“.NET Framework 3.5 (a.k.a. ‘Orcas’)”; those holding forth have included
<a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2007/05/02/47161.aspx">Don

<p>I suppose that in the Big Picture, this is a good thing; since we
all need to talk to Windows, anything that reduces the cost and friction 
has to be a win.
We should probably be prepared to excuse a little bitterness, though, among
people who invested all the work interoperating with what I guess we’ll soon
be calling “WCF Classic”.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Telephoto above, pancake below.</p></div>
<p>This bright cheery citizen of the garden looks fetching climbing the
weathered driftwood fence. I had the big old Tamron SP 70-210mm on the camera
to shoot the boy’s soccer game (great fun, see what I got
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/05/07/Sports-Photog">two summers ago</a>),
and was enjoying shooting the flowers from a dozen feet away.</p>
<p>Then I put on the new
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/04/27/Pentax-P-DA-40mm">Pentax 40mm prime “pancake”</a>
and took some of the same pictures.
I did a bit of cropping and other Lightroom magic to get the composition
and colours to match up reasonably well.  What do you think?</p>
<p>Mostly, I’m astonished how close they are. The telephoto has more extreme
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh">bokeh</a> which, with this
particular picture’s un-busy background, doesn’t make that much difference.
It’s easier to fill the frame with the telephoto zoom, so after cropping that
shot is about 1700 pixels square, compared to the 1200 or so with the prime
lens, which might make a difference at printing time.  Remember, I have the
original Pentax “*ist D” which is only six MP.</p>
<p>Actually getting the picture was easier with the telephoto.  But it’s such
a huge swollen heavy beast, the chance that I’ll take it along on any given
outing is relatively low; also the shots come slower, partly because it
doesn’t auto-focus, but also because of the zoom apparatus.</p>

<title>Lightroom and Open Source</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Over the last few years, I’ve become something of an open-source
triumphalist, drifting to the conclusion that (on the engineering side) it’s
the best way to build software and (on the business side) it’s a better way to
monetize it.  I have to confess that Adobe Lightroom has kind of shaken my
convictions.  Certain elements of its UI and design (for example, the
crop/rotate tool, and the nondestructive editing paradigm) are qualitative
steps forward in the state of the art.  Furthermore, I can’t think of a single
good business reason for Adobe to open-source it.  I guess the conclusion is
obvious: for the foreseeable future, both models of software building and
marketing are going to march along; neither is doomed.</p>

I’ve always felt that while he was a fine player and occasionally broke

remarkably-excellent musicians he always played with.  He got noticed in the

Davis band, then his own quartet (the one that appears here) was McCoy Tyner
on piano, Elvin Jones on drums, and Jimmy Garrison on bass.  Jeepers,
<em>I</em> would sound good singing in front of that band.</p>
<img src="jc0003.jpg" alt="John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman album cover" />
<div class="caption"><p>This picture looks the way the music sounds.</p></div>
<p>As for Johnny Hartman, I have to confess ignorance; I have this
record and a couple of random cuts pulled off Napster-that-was; he represents
one of my many unfinished-musical-education projects.
Apparently Coltrane was a big fan, and when they pitched the
“album of ballads with a singer” concept to him, Hartman was his first and
only choice.  It was a good choice.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Music</h2>
<p>OK, this admittedly is all-ballads, all-crooning; but Hartman’s voice is so
huge and rich and deep and intelligent, and the band so great, that that
doesn’t matter; I’ve reduced more than one resolute hard-rock head-banger to
emotional mush by playing this record.</p> 
<p>I just don’t know another singer who sounds anything like Johnny Hartman
does here. He manages the trick that opera singers strain for, usually
failing, of hitting remarkable high notes and low notes and long notes and
sugary notes and heavy vibratos and suddenly-no-vibrato and
still sounding natural and colloquial and just getting out of the way and
letting the music pour through.  His technique is so perfect that it just
vanishes.</p>
<p>There are only six songs, only a half-hour of music.  I honestly can’t pick
a favorite.  On the opening <cite>They Say It’s Wonderful</cite>, Coltrane 
attaches perfect little <i>sotto voce</i> ornaments to the places in the tune,
and only those places, where they need to be.</p>
<img src="jc0005.jpg" alt="Coltrane, Hartman, Tyner" />
<p>The lyrics of <cite>Dedicated to You</cite> are shamelessly sentimental,
but anyone who fancies themselves occasionally creative will have a hard time
not getting pulled along.</p>
<p><cite>My One and Only Love</cite> has a wonderful arching melody and
Hartman eases back on the ornamentation to ride it, but then Coltrane is there
again hanging little fragments of gold and diamond on the walls of the song.
Maybe, if I <em>had</em> to pick, my fave here.</p>
<p>Which brings us to <cite>Lush Life</cite>, which is difficult.
One time I was in a good hotel
in LA and they had an outstanding cocktail pianist in the lobby bar, a
pale-haired lady of a 
certain age with a whole lot of soul, she asked for requests and I said “Lush
Life” and she said “You <em>must</em> be kidding.”  It’s a completely
over-written song about booze and love and being wrong, with far too many words
and no actual verses and choruses and 
and hardly any melodies at all, frankly reminiscent in places of <i>Lieder</i>,
a genre I wholly hate.  But Hartman just nails it; switches to a lighter,
less-reverberant tone for the storytelling opening, meanders on and on but
then there’s Tyner dropping little clusters of notes in just the right places
and you just have to listen to the story.  Which gets weird and sad pretty
quick, and then Johnny sings <i>Ah yes... I was wrong, again; I was wrong</i>
and if you’ve had one too many drinks you’ll probably find yourself diluting the
next one with your tears; because who among us hasn’t been wrong about love?  
Then the song gets a little too complicated for its
own good, but still, there are two or three lines 
that are candidates for the best ever recorded by anyone.  <i>Romance is
mush</i>, indeed.  And Hartman’s last note always makes me twist up my face
because I can’t decide whether it’s perfect or just out of tune.  But for sure
it’s not boring.</p>
<p><cite>You Are Too Beautiful</cite> is arguably sexist and over-possessive
and exhibits all sorts of sentiments we currently prefer to route around; and
indeed some of it bothers me.  But then Hartman hits the big high note about
other men’s kisses and drops into <cite>if &lt;pause> on the other hand
&lt;pause> I’m faithful to you &lt;pause> it’s not through a sense of
duty...</cite> and listen to the enunciation, graceful granite, you can hear
not every word but every sub-sub-syllable, and Hartman doesn’t neglect any of
them.</p>
<p>I haven’t said much about Coltrane, who’s only one of the greatest sax
players ever.  That’s because he’s decided to get behind the singer and be
part of the band, and boy is he ever good at it.  Except for on <cite>Autumn
Serenade</cite>, in a rumba tempo.  This is the only cut where Hartman doesn’t 
suspend my disbelief, the singing is beautiful but it doesn’t touch my
experience.  Then Coltrane steps out and reminds you why his name is
first on the front of the record.  It sure is fun to listen to even if it
doesn’t cut anywhere near as deep as Hartman does on the good songs.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Sampling It</h2>
<p>Go get the CD already.  The sound is beautiful and uncluttered and if
perchance you should ever come into ownership of a really good stereo, you
won’t believe how great fifty-year-old recorded sound can be; before
studios were 
equipped with 70-channel all-digital mixing boards.  At standard CD pricing
it’s arguably expensive, but there are a few moments on here that are
entirely beyond price, so just put that behind you.</p>

<body>
<p>OK, I have to acknowledge that just possibly there are more than
<a href="x/2007/05/13/Four-Words">four words</a> to be said on the eve of the
war that Microsoft is (apparently) about to launch against the whole
technology industry.</p>
<p>Greg Papadopoulos considers the question
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/Gregp/entry/are_software_patents_useful">Are
Software Patents Useful?</a> at some length, ending up at what feels like a
sensible end-point.  What really grabbed my eye, though, was our General
Counsel Mike Dillon’s
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/dillon/entry/cautiously_optimistic">Cautiously
Optimistic</a>, which starts out with specifics about who’s suing <em>us</em>,
the kind of territory that most lawyers won’t go near in public.  Mike’s piece
is about legal tactics and business realities, and I like it a lot.</p>
<p>And I must admit that I’ve also emitted voluminous prose on the
subject: see
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/12/PatentTheory">Patent Theory</a> and
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/08/05/LinuxPatents">Patents

<p>Oh, and by the way: Microsoft should litigate or shut up.</p>

<title>RailsConf Day One</title>
</head>
<body>
<p><i>[Thursday]</i> Sitting in the airport getting ready to head out; it’s
been a while since 
I’ve spoken to over a thousand people (well, I do every day here, but that’s
different) so I’m nervous.  Happy, too; I’ve managed to schedule my
Sun-related work so I can get to a few sessions that sound super-interesting;
I expect to get my brain upgraded.  
<i>[Friday]</i> I’m filling in conference notes and pictures as the days go by.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Solr</h2>
<p>I had breakfast with
<a href="http://code4lib.org/">Erik Hatcher</a>, who is one of the
heavy-lifters in the Lucene world.  He’s working on
<a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Solr</a>, which is a REST interface
to Lucene. Back in 2003, in my
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/07/30/OnSearchTOC">On
Search</a>, I 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/11/16/SearchAPIs">called
for exactly this</a>, so obviously I think it’s a good idea.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Opening</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://www.chadfowler.com/">Chad Fowler</a> delivered an absolutely
smashing welcome.  He detoured from the obvious tech stuff,
acknowledged that the Rails community has a reputation for arrogance (there
was a scattering of applause; hmm) and
challenged the roomful of geeks to get involved,
<a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/donate">give some money</a> to a good
cause, and otherwise make a difference.  Go Chad!</p>
<p>Below is a picture of Chad and Rich Kilmer setting up for DHH’s
keynote.</p>
<img src="IMGP5302.jpg" alt="Chad Fowler and Rich Kilmer open RailsConf 2007" />
<h2 id='p-5'>DHH</h2>
<p>No obscenities, just a straightforward, entertaining state-of-Rails
survey.  The state is, more than anything else, RESTful.
The new stuff in the new Rails is all about mapping code to 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch">resources and
representations</a>.</p>			 
<img src="IMGP5305.jpg" alt="David Heinemeier Hansson opens RailsConf 2007" />
<p>Also, there’s some lovely-looking debugging code that ought to be
integrated with the stuff the IDE people are building.</p>
<p>Also, there’s a bunch of stuff to facilitate caching and HTTP
performance.
Which is an area that needs lots of attention; for example,
<a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/page/pmuellr?entry=that_darned_cat_1">Patrick
Mueller illustrates</a> apparent mis-use of HTTP by Twitter, which may well be
contributing to its performance problems.</p>
<p>I talked to David after the keynote about what they’re doing with ETags,
and the default Rails implementation is going to help save bandwidth, but do
nothing to offload the CPU.  I’m not sure that this is something that can be
fixed in the framework; at the end of the day, only an application knows when
it’s mangled some resource or another.  But anything Rails can do to help
programmers Do The Right Thing would be a major plus.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>The Sessions</h2>
<p>I enjoyed parts of
<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/rails2007/view/e_sess/11608">Clean
Code</a> by
<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/rails2007/view/e_spkr/3203">Bob
Martin</a> and
<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/rails2007/view/e_sess/11687">Doing
REST Right</a> by
<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/rails2007/view/e_spkr/3205">Scott
Raymond</a>.
Both sessions were jam-packed; for example, check out this
picture:</p>
<img src="IMGP5312.jpg" alt="Attendees at a RailsConf 2007 session" />
<p>The crowd are, on the face of it nearly all Mac-toting males:</p>
<img src="IMGP5315.jpg" alt="Attendees at a RailsConf 2007 session" />
<p>I haven’t had enough time to do the schmoozing yet to find out what kind of
people they are, where they come from.  But I’m really distressed to be
attending yet another nearly-all-male event.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>Trade Show</h2>
<p>There was an actual trade show; I guess Rails is going mainstream:</p>
<img src="IMGP5316.jpg" alt="The trade show at RailsConf 2007" />
<p>Below is our own
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/arungupta/">Arun Gupta</a> demonstrating
JMaki with Rails; apparently people liked it.</p>
<img src="IMGP5321.jpg" alt="Arun Gupta demonstrates JMaki on Rails at RailsConf2007" />
<h2 id='p-8'>Avi and Ze</h2>
<p><a href="http://smallthought.com/avi/">Avi Bryant</a>, once again, challenged the Ruby crowd, pointing out that
Smalltalk, a nearly-identical language, has immensely higher performance and a
culture of extending Smalltalk in Smalltalk; so why can’t Ruby have the same?
He’s right, I think.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zefrank.com/">Ze Frank</a> closed the evening; I wasn’t expecting much, since his little
video shows mostly didn’t reach me.  But he was excellent; funny and
also on-target, talking about the process of building his Web persona and
presentation.  There was some fairly standard stand-up comic fare in between,
but it was crisp and his timing great; definitely a good way to close the
evening.</p>

<p>Perhaps a little more all-over-the-map even than is usual: GPLv3 clarity,
Functional Pearls, raina bird-writer, Java credits, framework programmers, and
hacking my Canon.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>What Alison Said</h2>
<p>From Alison Randal, 
<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/05/gplv3_clarity_a.html">GPLv3, Clarity and Simplicity</a>
and is she ever right.  I reviewed the last draft of GPLv3 and I should
really go have a look at the latest, but I get a headache just thinking about
it.  Call me a wacko idealist, but I think that important legal documents
should be human-readable, and on the evidence I just don’t think Eben Moglen
and his friends give a damn.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>FP Pearls</h2>
<p>From the Haskell community,
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Research_papers/Functional_pearls">Research papers/Functional pearls</a>;
as CPUs get wider and wider, we’re just gonna have to bring some new
techniques to bear to get the most out of them, and my bet just at the moment
is that a lot of ’em are going to functional-programming techniques.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>The Violence of the English Language</h2>
<p>Wise and funny words from (but don’t click on the link yet)
<a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=68460456">raina
bird-writer</a>.  What happened was, I saw this amusing quote about English
and followed links back and back and back and ended up at
raina’s MySpace page.  It’s BSFW (barely safe for work) and you might want to
kill your computer audio before you head over there.  But that quotation about
our language is priceless.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Thanks, MR</h2>
<p>Mark Reinhold’s
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/mr/entry/roll_credits">Roll Credits!</a>; yes
indeed. 
It’s actually pretty easy for Jonathan and Rich to stand
on the stage and say “We’re gonna open-source our Java code under the GPL”
and bask in the wild applause, but it’s Mark and his troops who 
then had to actually, you
know, open-source our Java code under the GPL.</p>
<p>Mark tactfully omits himself from the credit roll, but it totally wouldn’t
be happening without him.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Framework Programmers</h2>
<p>Assaf Arkin has
<a href="http://blog.labnotes.org/2007/05/13/the-inevitable-migration-of-framework-coders/">The inevitable migration of framework coders</a>
and some would call elitist and, well, it is; but let’s assume he’s right, and
there’s a large class of people who will use the frameworks we give them
without looking too hard or diving too deep or wondering what’s under the
covers.  If that’s true, then it behooves framework <em>developers</em> to
ensure that the Framework does the right thing most of the time.  Which modern
frameworks like Rails and Django are starting to do.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>Hack Yer Canon</h2>
<p>Hey, my A710IS
<a href="http://scratchpad.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK/FAQ">can be hacked</a>!
I got it and tried it and it seems to work, except for Lightroom can’t read
the CRW files it generates.  Apparently you need a special CRW-to-DNG
filter.</p>

<title>Extra Action Marching Band</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith eleven photos of the
<a href="http://www.extra-action.com/">Extra Action Marching Band</a> and if
they’re coming through your town, you might want to take in the show.
Don’t take the kids, though.</p>
<p>The word went around at the beginning of Saturday that there’d be a musical
surprise at lunch.  Someone passed the word that it’d be a marching band, and
everyone loves a parade, you know.</p>
<p>I got outside while they were getting ready and forming up, and it was
instantly apparent they weren’t just another marching band.</p>
<img src="IMGP5335.jpg" alt="Extra Action Marching Band" />
<p>I was standing within a few feet of the horns when they kicked into their
first tune, and I just about jumped out of my skin.  Holy crap, are they ever
loud.  I was talking to an old session musician one time about high volume and
ear damage and so on, and he told me “Screw electric guitars, the loudest
thing I know is right in front of a big-band trumpet section.”</p>
<p>This would be about then.  Check out the drum majorettes in the background;
the band is just starting the march into the convention center.</p>
<img src="IMGP5336.jpg" alt="Extra Action Marching Band" />
<p>The sound inside was even more intense, and the majorettes really got their
mojo workin’ and the geeks dug it.  These were <em>major</em> majorettes, in
particular the six-and-a-half-foot dude with the really tight shorts.</p>
<img src="IMGP5364.jpg" alt="Extra Action Marching Band" />
<img src="IMGP5372.jpg" alt="Extra Action Marching Band" />
<p>The guy with the bull-horn talked to the crowd between tunes, and while the
band was playing kept up this furious gabble of high-pitched rap that you
couldn’t understand but somehow turned the heat up a bit.  Dig the Tom Waits
persona.</p>
<p>They totally didn’t have this kind of drum majorette in my high school.</p>
<img src="IMGP5375.jpg" alt="Extra Action Marching Band" />
<p>The drums were the bands’ dominant voice; the horns were loud and sharp and
tight, but their parts were pretty basic.  The drums, in particular the handsome
guy with the tom-toms, were astounding in their aggression and
precision, and the parts they were playing were <em>not</em> kindergarten
stuff.  I can’t imagine anyone’s heart not racing when they got the groove
going.</p>
<img src="IMGP5377.jpg" alt="Extra Action Marching Band" />
<p>It was the majorettes, of course, who caught the geeks’ eyes and had every
camera up and clicking.</p>
<img src="IMGP5370.jpg" alt="Extra Action Marching Band" />
<p>My camera too.
This is the new
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/04/27/Pentax-P-DA-40mm">Pentax Pancake</a>
and I haven’t nearly mastered it yet, but it sure is fun.</p>
<img src="IMGP5382.jpg" alt="Extra Action Marching Band" />
<img src="IMGP5384.jpg" alt="Extra Action Marching Band" />
<img src="IMGP5387.jpg" alt="Extra Action Marching Band" />
<img src="IMGP5389.jpg" alt="Extra Action Marching Band" />
<p>Then things got a little ugly.  As I noted, these guys were loud, and it
turns out that elsewhere in the building was one conference on Asian Culture
for Children, and in another a Women’s Conference on Understanding Men, and
the building management was getting complaints about these louche 
<i>demi-mondaine</i> cabaret/brass-band hybridistas blowing the roof off the
place.  So an authoritative type came around to make it try and stop, or to
get them to play quieter or something, but that wasn’t happening and it
started feeling a little bit ugly when the assembled geek music lovers started
booing the building management.</p>
<p>But then everyone cooled down and we had lunch.</p>

<title>RailsConf Day Two</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The first hour and fifteen of the day was Cyndi Mitchell of
ThoughtWorks and me in keynote mode.  The interesting part, though, was the
hallways and lunch.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>♂♀♂♂♂♂♂♂♂♂♂♂♂♀♂♂♂☹</h2>
<p>In the keynote, I griped about the all-male audience.
I’m sorry, I’m not going to shut up about this: it is irritating,
disturbing, and unacceptable that probably less than 100 of the 1600 attendees
were women.  It’s probably pretty lame of me to say “unacceptable” when I have
exactly zero good ideas about how to fix it.  I talked to a random selection of
attendees; two women said “thank you for saying that” and a bunch of men said
“yeah, it sucks, what can be done?”</p>
<p>Geeks, you know, they’re admittedly obsessive about computers, but once you
get past that they’re on average a pretty eclectic, amusing, and warm-hearted
bunch.  And in recent years I haven’t met a single one who wasn’t upset about
the missing gender.  If a booming female Voice From On High spoke out, saying,
“Do this and we’ll rejoin your profession”, well I bet a lot of us would do
whatever it was.
But failing that, in the meantime the problem isn’t getting better.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Keynote Notes</h2>
<p>I loved speaking to that crowd, and they laughed at what I thought were the
funny bits.  I picked up some static on Twitter about my explanation of
why Sun cares about Ruby and Rails: “Because you create
computer programs, and you’re going to need hardware and software
infrastructure to run them on, and that’s what we sell.  D’oh.”  
The grouchiness happened when I did a 
little slide show of things we might want to sell, in which I whimsically
included the
<a href="http://www.sun.com/servers/highend/m9000/">mighty M9000</a> and
suggested that its 64 processors and 2TB of RAM (starting at only $511,385!)
might be just the thing to juice Twitter up.  Lots of people laughed,
though.</p>
<p>The technical meat of my keynote will be familiar to 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> readers: the network is and will remain
heterogeneous, and we have to make all the different infrastructures play nice
together, and REST is our best bet for doing that, and, oh by the way, let’s
do ETags better.  I’m totally starting to
<a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/2007/05/18/Shallow-Rest">sound like Sam Ruby</a>.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Who Was There</h2>
<p>I did a couple of straw polls from the stage.  First choice: do you work
for (a) a startup, (b) a non-startup company, (c) a consultant/service
provider/integrator.  The first two groups were the largest, and about equal
in size: at a guess I’d say 40/40/20.
Way more startups than I’d expected.</p>
<p>I asked if there were anyone there for whom Ruby/Rails was their
<em>first</em> Web development framework, and a scattering of hands went up;
not many, but more than I’d expected.</p>
<p>Then I asked the rest of the crowd where they’d come from on their way to
Rails: (a) Java, (b) Microsoft-land, or (c) PHP.  It was Java, then PHP, then
Microsoft; at a guess something 45/20/35.  The fact that PHP was ahead of
Microsoft surprised me, but maybe it shouldn’t: I’ve been predicting for a
while now that Rails will take a piece of PHP’s market share.</p>
<p>In the hallways and lunch tables, I was blunt, asking everyone I talked to
where they came from and why they came and what they did.
Ladies and gentlemen, here’s the news: Rails is getting <em>awfully damn
mainstream</em>.  To the extent that I observed basically no industry-sector
or customer-size pattern to speak of; just all over the map.</p>
<p>The stories reflected three stages of Rails adoption: just here to check it
out; tried a few projects, they went great and we’re figuring out what’s next;
Rails is more or less all we do now.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Take-Aways</h2>
<p>Thanks to Chad and the others for putting the show on, keep ’em coming.</p>

<title>5✭♫: The Texas Campfire Tapes</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Just like the title says, this was recorded 
by a campfire in Texas in 1986 (on a pre-digital Sony Walkman).  Voice and
guitar and brilliant music bursting out in all directions by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Shocked">Michelle Shocked</a>,
one of my personal musical heroes. But there’s some controversy about which
version to get.
<i>(“5✭♫” series introduction <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music">here</a>;
with <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music#p-1">an
explanation</a> of why the title may look broken.)</i></p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Context</h2>
<p>I’ve seen Ms Shocked live twice (born Karen something somewhere in Texas
sometime, you want biographical details they’re on the Net) and I’ve never
figured out why she didn’t become a kazillion-selling mega-star.  Her songs are
as good as 
anyone’s, she’s got tons of charisma, and you can’t leave one of her concerts
without a smile on your face.
I guess she’s kind of political and uncompromising and that’s not
fashionable.</p>
<img src="Michelle.png" alt="Michelle Shocked" />
<p>I remember seeing her at some big festival in California in the Nineties,
she came out on stage and was just tearing it up, stopped to talk to the
audience and told about how she’d visited the doctor:
“The doctor said ‘Honey, you got a problem, you got hemorrhoids because your
ass it’s just way too tight, you gotta loosen up and shake it.’  So <em>let’s
go!</em>”</p>
<p>I’ve got a bunch of her disks on the shelf and like ’em all, but this one’s
always stood out in my mind.</p>
<img src="CFT.png" class="inline" alt="The Texas Campfire Tapes, by Michelle Shocked" />
<h2 id='p-2'>The Music</h2>
<p>Like most inhabitants of this planet, I have a love/hate relationship with
the United States of America.  On the “hate” side, see politics.
On the “love” side, see music.  The <cite>Texas Campfire Tapes</cite> is all
over the musical map, but it’s still easy to sum up: American music.
I wrote this about it once many years ago in
<a href="http://www.theabsolutesound.com/">The Absolute Sound</a>: <i>Michelle
Shocked is so far into the bedrock of American music 
that it seems superfluous to point out a blue note here, an Ozark
mountain seasoning there, or a swing tempo somewhere else.</i></p>
<p>The songs here are just <em>ridiculously</em> good, they’ll stick to your
brain, guaranteed.  The guitar accompaniment is sharp and tight and yeah, her
voice is kinda thin and bony, but it’s graceful and sinuous and the tuning and
timing are totally <em>right</em>, I’ve heard international opera superstars
whose intonation is shaky, relatively speaking.</p>
<p>Two of the songs aren’t actually sung, they’re spoken and they’re still
totally music, 
<cite>The Incomplete Image</cite> and 
<cite>Ghost Town</cite> back-to-back on the record, the rhythm and the words
are really all you need:</p>
<blockquote><p>Did I tell you the story of the poor man's daughter<br/>
Or the poor man's lover<br/>

She keeps his house for her room and board.</p></blockquote>
<p>I suppose if you were a formalist you might call these Talking Blues or
some such, they’re just great songs that aren’t actually sung.
And when she slides into <i>Uh-uh/Keep some secrets, never tell/And those
secrets will keep you very well</i> on <cite>Ghost Town</cite> you gotta
shiver.</p>
<p>If what you want is a truly great tune with a good singer digging way deep
into the words and music, there are lots here, my faves are <cite>The Hep
Cat</cite> (“Boom, chicka-boom, chicka-boom”) or (especially)
<cite>Fogtown</cite>, a sad story of a sad hooker coming to a sad end in San
Francisco: <i>There was one less siren when the sirens reached the
scene</i>.  But what a tune, if you’re not boppin’ you’re paralyzed.</p>
<p>As to the sound... well, it’s not good.  Kind of thin and reedy and there
are those eighteen-wheelers on the highway providing unwelcome background
rumble (but listen to Ms Shocked sing around them).  I’m the worst kind of
sicko audiophile, but at the end of the day most audiophiles value truth above
all, and this crappy analogue tape captured a lot of it.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Sampling It</h2>
<p>Well, there’s an issue here.  I have the CD and it says “Mercury 834 581-2”
and I’ve listened to it a million times and I never get tired of it.  But when
I was researching this little piece I wandered to the 
<a href="http://www.michelleshocked.com/">official Web site of Michelle Shocked</a> and ran across
<a href="http://www.michelleshocked.com/texas-campfire-takes.htm">The Texas
Campfire Takes</a> which suggests the provenance of the original that I so
love is not entirely honorable.</p>
<p>I dunno; now I kind of feel morally obligated to buy the official re-take; but
damn, I love the original.  I suspect that whichever you buy, you’ll be
happy you did.</p>

<title>OpenID Patent Covenant</title>

<p>Sun just announced a Patent Non-assert Covenant on OpenID; chapter and

<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/webmink/entry/ten_reasons_the_world_needs">Simon

<a href="http://www.sun.com/software/standards/persistent/openid/nac.xml">the covenant</a>
itself; four short paragraphs of simple, almost jargon-free, English.  Why
can’t we do this more often?  I’m told that our own Eduardo Gutentag gets the

<p>Now,
<a href="http://search.technorati.com/">this</a> is what I’ve always wanted.
I’m feeling kind of unhappy with myself; time after time, Dave Sifry has
showed me some new frippery they’re rolling out at Technorati and I’ve said
“Yeah, that’s kind of cool, maybe you could twiddle X” even though it didn’t
turn my personal crank that much.  My problem has been that I was assuming
that the way I want to use Technorati is unusual.  I use it for vanity feeds
of course, but the when I go to the site, I only ever want to ask two
questions: “What are they saying about &lt;insert recent event>?” and “Where
was that article I saw recently about &lt;insert
subject>?”
The new, very Google-flavored
<a href="http://search.technorati.com/">search.technorati.com</a> does those
things, and that’s all it does.  Plus, it seems a whole lot faster.</p>
<p>Mind you, Technorati is making a dual-track bet.  The
<a href="http://www.technorati.com/">main front page</a> has even more
fripperies, that I’m assuming are what some proportion of the population want.
But check out the results of searches for “Vancouver” from

And my

I’ve tried a ton of newsreaders on a ton of platforms.  Google’s blog reader

<title>New 21mm Lens</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Still in the grip of Prime Lens Mania (“prime” means no zoom), I ventured
into the wilds of eBay and picked up a Pentax
<a href="http://www.pentaximaging.com/products/product_details/camera_lens--smc_P-DA_21mm_F3.2_AL_Limited/reqID--7878390/subsection--Digital_35mm_wide_angle">smc
21mm P-DA F3.2</a>, in theory the perfect companion to the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/04/27/Pentax-P-DA-40mm">40mm
“Pancake”</a>. With illustrations and a cat-blogging bonus.</p>
<p>Very few pictures are worth anywhere near a thousand words, but this pair
might be worth a couple hundred. The same scene from the same position, a
corner of our back garden.  The 21mm wide-angle above, the 40mm pancake
below.</p>
<img src="IMGP5419.jpg" alt="Garden scene shot with Pentax smc P-DA 21mm" />
<img src="IMGP5422.jpg" alt="Garden scene shot with Pentax smc P-DA 40mm" />
<p>The theory, I guess, is that the 21mm is for carrying around a city or a
mountain and shooting views and vistas; the 40mm for taking a garden or
party and shooting flowers and faces.
One of these renditions looks a whole lot more like what I think I see
than the other.  What do you think?</p>
<p>I’ve decided that while the prime lenses may be (in theory) better glass,
and a little faster too, my eyes aren’t good enough to care about the
differences, other things being equal, between a prime shot and a zoom shot.
The thing about the prime 
lenses is that they remove a distraction, encourage you to leave one hand off
the camera, compose with your body, and shoot faster.</p>
<p>After dinner, our two cats and some neighborhood became involved in 
complex maneuvers involving the porch roof and the pear tree (the crows
<em>hate</em> the cats, and say so noisily).  I had the pancake on and the
camera handy.</p>

<img src="IMGP5450.jpg" alt="Apricot-coloured poppies" />
<p>The vegetation isn’t as pretty, but it’s still worth looking at.</p>
<p>I’ve been shooting for a few weeks now with “classic” format prime lenses,
first the mouldy old 50mm from the film era, and more recently the 40mm pancake.
I’m making myself walk around with the 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/05/24/Pentax-SMC-DA-21mm">new 21mm</a> and
suffering some pretty severe cognitive dissonance between the tight little
pieces of of the scene where my eye sees pictures and the great bit wide
swathes the lens wants to take.  Well, anyhow, this would have been
pretty well impossible without a wide-angle and it’s kind of cool that you’d
never know that looking at the picture, but also it bother me that this big
sprawling poppy patch looks like it’s huddled together for the photographer’s
benefit.</p>

<title>Canada vs. Chile</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I bet most of you have never seen pictures of an international
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_Hockey">Field Hockey</a> match,
but I got some.</p>
<p>What happened was, the 7-year-old decided that he wanted to try out field
hockey, a sport I’ve never been near.  This last weekend, the Chilean men’s
and women’s national teams were in town for friendlies with the Canadians, and
the kid brought home a flyer from practice.  So we went, and I took the 
telephoto of course.</p>
<p>We got there toward the end of the women’s game, and now I regret not
arriving sooner, they
were a bit more visually dramatic than the men, and since I don’t really
understand the strategy or tactics, visuals are the thing.</p>
<img src="IMGP5454.jpg" alt="Canada vs. Chile, women’s field hockey" />
<p>Most goals seem to involve goal-mouth scrambles, with the ball bouncing
around in front of the net and a lot of players in there.  Here’s a goal being
scored, and the ensuing celebration.</p>
<img src="IMGP5466.jpg" alt="Canada vs. Chile, men’s field hockey" />
<img src="IMGP5468.jpg" alt="Canada vs. Chile, men’s field hockey" />
<p>Here’s another goalmouth scramble, but nobody scored.</p>
<img src="IMGP5475.jpg" alt="Canada vs. Chile, men’s field hockey" />
<p>The game gets pretty physical sometimes.</p>
<img src="IMGP5477.jpg" alt="Canada vs. Chile, men’s field hockey" />
<p>It’s more like soccer to watch than like any other sport.  It’s all
passing, there don’t seem to be many instances of individual attackers knifing
through the defense.
I enjoyed photographing it, but I don’t think I’ll become a big fan.</p>

<title>REST News</title>

<body>
<p>I’d been going to do a REST news round-up, but
<a href="http://rollerweblogger.org/roller/entry/friday_atom_and_rest_links">Dave
Johnson</a> beat me to it.  He calls it “Atom and REST” and yes, I’ve noticed
a pattern where you get a handful or more of RESTafarians in a room, virtual
or real, and Atom keeps bubbling up.  Not just the protocol, but the data
format too.  Oops, Dave missed one:
<a href="http://wanderingbarque.com/nonintersecting/2007/05/25/message-level-security-and-rest/">Pete
Lacey</a>.</p>
<p>On a related REST subject, 
<a href="http://plasmasturm.org/log/460/">Aristotle Pagaltzis</a>,
<a href="http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/2007/05/28/does_rest_need_a_service_description_language.html">Stefan
Tilkov</a>, and
<a href="http://fuzzypanic.blogspot.com/2007/05/wadl-gateway-drug.html">Mike
Herrick</a> have been talking over whether RESTful services need a description
language in general or
<a href="https://wadl.dev.java.net/">WADL</a> in particular.</p>
<p>I usually agree with Aristotle, but I think the answer is obvious.  Enough
people <em>think</em> that you need to describe services formally that not
having one is an unnecessary barrier to adoption.  Personally, I’m one of
those people.  I think writing formal schemas is a good idea for language
designers even if they never get used at run-time; they’re good for
documentation, tooling, and (not least important) forcing you to think
formally about your problem space.</p>
<p>I like WADL but who knows, maybe it’s not the last word.  Either way; yes,
there <em>is</em> a hole in the ecosystem here.</p>

<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4306936.stm">reports</a> that the

Prime Minister Paul Martin, who’s from Québec, with a dorky-looking Mountie, 
is pretty lame.  But still, thereby
hangs a tale.</p>

Germany.  Eventually I started trying to persuade her to move to Vancouver.
She was tired of Germany but, as a New Zealander whose happiest years had been
in Melbourne, she was hankering for Down Under.</p>
<p>Eventually, we came to agreement and she moved to Vancouver, which has made
me very happy.  But the agreement has a fallback clause: if we ever move from
Vancouver, it has to be to Melbourne.</p>

Doesn’t mean having programmable persistence in the browser isn’t a good

that’s 
sensitive to the needs of any particular Ajax code.  I mean, consider a mapping

<a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2007/05/verschfte_verne.html">points
out</a> prior use of the term “Enhanced Interrogation”, promoted not only by the
malevolent thickheads of the Bush administration but by most of the Republican
candidates for President; prior use, that is, by the Gestapo.  Meanwhile Dick
Cheney 
<a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2007/05/cheney_at_west_.html">argues</a>
that the Geneva Convention and the U.S. Constitution are tools for terrorists.
Has the American right wing completely lost its mind?
I even had to unsubscribe from Instapundit; I thought I ought to keep in touch
with one articulate camera-loving righty, but there was one too many waves of
nausea provoked by his “Al-Qaeda tortures much worse than we do and the
Mainstream Media ignores it” whining.
I had come to think, in mid-life, that while I will never really be
conservative, there are smart honorable people on that side who have good points
to make.  That may be true outside the United States, but in the American
context, near as I can tell, at the moment “conservative” means
“pro-torture” which means “scum”.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it appears that there is
<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/10/AR2007051001963.html">some
honor left</a>, and of course, the chances are that American democracy will
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/02/23/Democracy">function as intended</a> and
this particular spasm of ugliness will pass.  The trouble is that my

<p>In recent talks, I’ve been using a graphic from 
<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/05/state_of_the_co_10.html">State of the Computer Book Market</a>,
written for O’Reilly Radar by
<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/mikeh/">Mike Hendrickson</a>, and it’s been
preying on my mind.
The more I think about it, and about the
programming-languages landscape, the more I think that this picture isn’t 
changing much any time soon.  The landscape is stable.</p>
<p>Here’s the graphic, and if you like it, you
really ought to go read the 
<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/05/state_of_the_co_10.html">whole
article</a>, which has lots of meat and other graphics too.  Also, I think the
IT industry owes O’Reilly a major vote of thanks for buying the data and
investing in the analysis.</p>
<img src="Languages.png" alt="Graph by O’Reilly of computer book sales grouped

<p>Let’s just sort these out by date of introduction: 
C/C++ (1972), SQL (1978), C++ (1983), Visual Basic (1991), PHP (1994), Ruby
(1995), Java (1995), JavaScript(1995), C# (2001).
Kind of, well, elderly, aren’t they?</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>What’s Hot?</h2>
<p>Are any of the bars on the graph about to shoot up and dwarf the others?  I
doubt it; the 
only two groups with significant growth recently are Ruby (as a function of
Rails) and JavaScript (as a function of Ajax).</p>
<p>I think Ruby has some more upside; as the wave of Rails adoption gets it in
front of more programmers, a certain proportion will be seduced. 
It seems that Java programmers are particularly vulnerable to Ruby’s
charms.</p>
<p>JavaScript too; I’d say why I think so, but Steve Yegge already did (albeit
without mentioning its name) in 
<a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/02/next-big-language.html">The
Next Big Language</a>.</p>
<p>I’m not sure, though, that I can see JavaScript really breaking out of the
browser ghetto.  It doesn’t provide anything, as far as I can see, that you
don’t get from one of the other candidates.  On the other hand, we’re going to
be needing a lot of browser programming for the foreseeable future, and
JavaScript is how you do that.</p>
<p>So yes, some of the bars will inch up; but then they’ll be fighting the Law
of Big Numbers.  It’s plausible to get from nowhere to half as big as C++ and
do it quickly; but
then you’re into the territory of sunk investments and big-community
dynamics and so on.  Rapid qualitative growth, beyond a certain point, is just
hard to believe in.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>What’s Doomed?</h2>
<p>Are there any here that might go away?  
The only one that feels threatened at all is VB, wounded perhaps fatally in
the ungraceful
transition to .NET.  I suppose it’s unlikely that many people
would pick VB for significant <em>new</em> applications.  Perhaps it’s the
closest to being this millennium’s COBOL; still being used a whole lot, but not
creatively.</p>
<p>Some might glance in the direction of C and C++, but they’re totally with
us for the long haul, C at least.  C, among languages of its kind (vehicles 
for clean infrastructure code that’s right up against the metal)
is a good one.  C++, among its peers (object-oriented languages for writing
applications), is very far from the best.</p>
<p>Having said that, C and C++ were the default choices, for enough years, for
writing important pieces of the platform, that their future is secure.</p>
<p>I suspect that PHP’s market share gets chewed away at by Rails as people
notice the sharp contrast in maintainability, but there are a lot of good
PHP-based applications, which should keep it on the main stage for a while.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>What’s Missing?</h2>
<p>Are there any other languages that we can reasonably expect to emerge from
the background and be on this graph a couple of years from now?
I notice a distinct lack of functional languages (Erlang, Haskell, Scala), and
what with “scaling out” and many-core and so on, I’d be unsurprised to see a
break-through from that direction.  But Functional Programming is a challenge,
and I’d also be unsurprised to see enough FP bolted onto the side of the
conventional O-O wisdom to get us through, in combination with throwing enough
memory on servers to keep those cores busy running processes not threads.</p>
<p>I also notice that Ruby’s the only really sophisticated dynamically-typed
language on the list, and there are a lot of really smart programmers who’ve
been doing wonderful work in Python for years and see no reason to stop.  Among
other things, Python (for the moment at least) runs a whole lot faster than
Ruby, plenty fast enough to be used for compute-intensive work; and at some
point that has to matter.  So, maybe Python.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Client Apps, Web Apps, RIAs?</h2>
<p>This past year, there’ve been waves of enthusiasm over “Rich Internet
Application” frameworks: the DLR, Apollo, JavaFX and so on.
Among those, I
have a soft spot for JavaFX not only because we cooked it up but because it’s
unambiguously open-source and doesn’t constitute a bet on a vendor.</p>
<p>Still, I think the jury’s way, way, out on the RIA notion.  Does the
expanding scope of Ajax leave a big enough gap to grow a
new ecosystem in?  And, at the end of the day, will there be enough richness to
seduce enough people away from the considerable charms of
the browser and its reassuring “Back” button?  We’ll see.</p>
<h2 id='p-8'>Mobile</h2>
<p>People—really smart people—keep pointing out that there are ever so many
more phones than PCs, and they’re biting into the digital divide, and
that when you’re writing an app, you shouldn’t expect it to run just on
something so old-fashioned as a “computer”.</p>
<p>People keep saying this and it keeps not happening, for me at least.  I’m
starting to think that when the time comes that the mobile phone has
become a mainstream application platform, it’ll have evolved to the point that
you use about the same range of programming techniques and tools and
languages.  So I’m not sure it’ll be a major disruptor of the O’Reilly
graph.</p>
<p>In fact, my bet right now is that nothing will.</p>

<body>
<p>We
<a href="http://www.sun.com/servers/blades/6000/index.xml?intcmp=hp2007jun06_launch_learn">announced a bunch of blade stuff</a> this morning and I honestly couldn’t
think of anything useful to write about it, since it’s a decade or two
since I was a sysadmin and discussion of I/O density and the like tends to go
over my head.
Apparently you can have Xeon and Opteron and SPARC and Windows and Solaris and
Linux all in the same chassis, which sounds kind of terrifying to me.  I did
get to hear Andy Bechtolsheim give the spiel on the I/O design once, I
understood maybe 20% but it sounded awesome.
Anyhow, there is an interesting angle: it turns out we gave Scoble over at
PodTech a pre-release exclusive for his
<a href="http://www.podtech.net/scobleshow/technology/1522/sun-microsystems-releases-new-blades">video
coverage</a>.  Which is not exactly high-gloss marketing, mostly just John
Fowler in a monochrome meeting room with some journos, pulling dull silver
blades and I/O modules out of dull silver chassis boxes
and talking about the tech, taking a few questions.  I think it’s immensely
more effective than most product-launch bumph.  As for the products, I
don’t really have an informed opinion; but if you understand 
blades, you probably will if you watch the video.</p>

<title>June 5, 1967</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I missed the anniversary.  Forty years ago yesterday, I was in “First
Secondary” i.e. 7th Grade, at
<a href="http://www.ic.edu.lb/">International College</a>, in Beirut,
Lebanon.  My
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Dad</a> was a Professor of
Agriculture at the <a href="http://www.aub.edu.lb/">American University of
Beirut</a>; that spring, the family was living at the
<a href="http://wwwlb.aub.edu.lb/~webphoto/arec1.html">University
Experimental Farm</a> while I stayed with friends in Beirut.  In June it was
getting warm, so Phys Ed class was held at the
<a href="http://www.aub.edu.lb/tour/admissions/AUB-VR_170.html">AUB Beach</a>;
it was towards the end of the school year and they pretty well just turned us
loose to have fun.  Except for Monday June 5th, suddenly the gym teacher was
hollering for us to get out of the water, get showered and dressed
double-quick, and back to class.  Only there were no classes, just sit down
and shut up.  
Nobody told us anything, but pretty soon we all found out
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War">the war had started</a>.
One by one our parents showed up to get us.  Later that
morning there was Dad’s face poking in the
classroom door, he’d had to drive an hour and a half in from the farm.  A few
days later we were evacuated, just to be safe, for a few very pleasant weeks
in Greece. 
I’ll never forget it.  The whole region still has a nasty hangover from that
war, which settled, really, nothing.</p>

<title>Thread Herrings</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Over the last couple of years, I’ve
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/Concurrency/">written lots</a> here
about concurrency, and its issues for developers.  The proximate
cause is that my employer is pushing the many-core CPU envelope harder than
anyone.  This last week there’s been an outburst of discussion: from
<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/06/the_faint_signa.html">Nat
Torkington</a>,
<a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/posts/7-multi-core-hysteria-and-the-thread-confusion">David
Heinemeier Hansson</a>, and
<a href="http://fiatdev.com/2007/5/2/are-native-threads-worth-it">Phillip
Toland</a>.  They’re all worth reading, and the problem isn’t going away.  But
I’m worrying about it less all the time.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing: I’m looking at the class of problems that are best
addressed by real actual shared-address-space threads, and it’s looking
smaller and smaller and smaller.</p>
<p>That’s the world you have to live in, within the operating system or the Web
server or the database kernel... but for applications?  These days, you’re way
better scaling out not up.  Shared memory?  Hell, shared <em>nothing</em> if
you can get away with it.</p>
<p>It isn’t free.  You have to pay a per-process memory tax, 
and worry about saturating the network and (de)serializing the
data and all sorts of other stuff.  But for now, it seems you still win.</p>
<p>Computers are still going to look more and more like those many-core SPARCs
we’re shipping, but at the application level, that should be a red herring.</p>
<p>Which is why there’s a new Erlang book and strange words like “Haskell” and
“Hadoop” echo in geeky back-rooms.  In an ideal world you have a
message-passing layer that figures how to move ’em around using whatever
combination of threads and processes and shared memory and bits-on-wires gets
the job done.</p>
<p>(This also reinforces my opinion that message-queuing systems will
inevitably end up at the center of everything serious; but I digress.)</p>
<p>It will doubtless be pointed out that on the client, threads will
remain in application programmers’ faces for the foreseeable future.  Which I
see as another argument for doing everything you can through the Web.</p>

<title>I’ve Seen This Movie</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>It turns out that the Atom Protocol isn’t good enough for whatever
part of Microsoft Dare Obasanjo works in,
<a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2007/06/09/WhyGDataAPPFailsAsAGeneralPurposeEditingProtocolForTheWeb.aspx">he
says</a>.  Three things should be said: First, Dare’s arguments are bogus.
Second, if you were paranoid and cynical, you might
wonder what Microsoft’s up to (I’m paranoid and cynical.)
Finally, this is actually good news.
<i>[Update: Check out
Dare’s
<a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2007/06/11/GDataIsntABestPracticeImplementationOfTheAtomPublishingProtocol.aspx">GData isn't a Best Practice Implementation of the Atom Publishing Protocol</a>
and <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2007/06/12/MicrosoftAndTheAtomPublishingProtocol.aspx">Microsoft and the Atom Publishing Protocol</a>,
and especially Joe Cheng’s
<a href="http://jcheng.wordpress.com/2007/06/12/microsoft-is-not-sabotaging-app-probably/">Microsoft is not sabotaging APP (probably)</a>.
It looks like Microsoft will be joining the APP
party after all; excellent!  On GData: as of April’s interop event,
GData, based on an early draft of the APP, was far from being an interoperable
drop-in implementation.  But that’s what the event was for; Kyle
Marvin and the Googlers gathered tons of hands-on data and, last time I
checked, still say they intend to do APP straight-up.</i>]</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>He’s Wrong</h2>
<p>Joe Gregorio covers most of the territory:
<a href="http://bitworking.org/news/197/In-which-we-narrowly-save-Dare-from-inventing-his-own-publishing-protocol">In which we narrowly save Dare from inventing his own publishing protocol</a>.
Dare’s claim that APP doesn’t cover the synchronization problem is really
egregious and establishes that he doesn’t actually understand APP (no
surprise, he hasn’t participated in the WG since 2005 and didn’t take the
trouble to come to the interop meeting).
When one of his commenters pointed this out he harumphed “Of
course, I haven't found any Atom servers or other RESTful Web service
implementations that support this in the wild but that doesn't mean it isn't
possible” which I 
would translate as “What I said was completely wrong”.</p>
<p>But what made my blood pressure threaten to squirt out my
ears was the line about re-inventing WebDAV poorly, repeated in the
comments.  This is cluelessness on a Napoleonic scale, establishing that Dare
doesn’t actually understand the key difference between APP and WebDAV (In APP,
the server takes care of navigating the URI space; in WebDAV, the client owns
the problem.)
WTF!?!?</p>
<p>So, while APP might not work for some part
of Microsoft, it won’t be for Dare’s reasons.
One would assume that the world’s largest software company, when facing a
technology choice, would take the trouble to actually, you know,
<em>understand</em> the technologies involved, but the evidence doesn’t
support that assumption.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Why?</h2>
<p>The thing is, I’ve seen this movie before:  The movie where there’s an
emerging standard that’s got some buzz and looks promising and maybe it’ll
raise the tide and float all our boats a little higher, and then Microsoft
says they won’t play.</p>
<p>Since there are huge numbers of computers out there with Microsoft client
software, APP-enabling those clients would definitely lift the tide.
But then, of course, the people using those computers would be able to post to
any old online property they want to.  As opposed to just
<a href="http://spaces.live.com/">Spaces</a>.  By the way, Dare has spent
quite a bit of time on the Spaces team.</p>
<p>Do I believe that Microsoft would deliberately steer their client
implementations away from APP and toward something else that Windows Live
Spaces would have the first and perhaps only implementation of?  Well,
um... <em>yes</em>.</p>
<p>But I wouldn’t sweat it too much.  Microsoft has tried to swim against the
current of the Internet a few times before, and it’s basically never
worked.  So they can go and invent their own publishing protocol and that’s 
sad, because it’ll be wasted work.  Oh well, shit happens.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>This Isn’t Bad News</h2>
<p>There’s another movie I’ve seen before.  It’s the movie where an interesting
new protocol or interface or API comes along, is starting to get adoption,
and big incumbent vendors say “That’s too simple for our needs”.  Examples of
such technologies include Unix, C, SQL, Java, and RSS:
the kinds of technologies that end 
up winning.  (I’ve written about this before in the
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/01/03/TPM1">TPSM</a>
series:
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/01/14/TPSM-8020">The 80/20
Point</a>).</p>
<p>There are places (network TV, Middle Eastern politics) where cluelessness
regularly triumphs.  Internet protocols aren’t one of them.  Sorry, Dare.
And this kind of movie usually has a happy ending.</p>

<title>東京 I: Visiting</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Tokyo, you know, it’s like this.  After I’ve been there 48 hours I start to
go crazy, and there’s this question: how do the people manage?
I mean the lousy weather and the endless concrete and the absence of
silence, never a rest for the eyes or ears either,
and the crowds and the crowds and the crowds.</p>
<img src="IMGP5780.jpg" alt="Somewhere in Roppongi" />
<div class="caption"><p>Somewhere in Roppongi.</p></div>
<p>But then, when I haven’t been to Tokyo for a year or so, I
start to think of the nice people and the food and drink and intensity and
good times and cool stores, and most of all the dazzling fact that
it does manage, gets through each day to the next.
Then I start thinking about how I can manage my next visit, because I miss
it.</p>

<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/15/Tokyo%20Transit">doesn’t need me to

around 2.2 million).</p>
<p>There’s nothing terribly innovative, it’s private blogging and
conversations for your friends
&amp; family, without the ugliness or teenage whine of MySpace.
Judging by my own network, I’d say that quite a few people spend
altogether too much time updating their Facebook.  Me, I spend altogether too
much time blogging, but that’s <em>different</em>, you see.</p>
<p>I guess the thing that stands out is that it all pretty well Just Works,
gets the job done, is easy on the eye, and runs fast.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Surprising Story</h2>
<p>A woman from another country, a country I visit now and then, friended me.
I didn’t recognize her but thought maybe I’d seen some of her
other friends’ faces.  So we had a conversation, like so:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Me:</i> Um, have we met?</p>
<p><i>Her:</i> Well maybe. I am the daughter of <i>[name omitted]</i> and my
biological father who I haven't met is called Tim Bray.</p>
<p>All I know of him is that he was born in <i>[place omitted]</i> we
think. He should be about 50 years old by now and I would very much like to
meet him.</p>
<p>I have been trying to find him for years, is it you?</p>
<p><i>Me:</i> <i>[Places and dates omitted.]</i>
Discovering an unexpected daughter would be a pleasant surprise, but it
doesn't look like it. (I have a daughter of my own, about to turn one year
old).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if you’re another of the Tim Brays out there and think you might have an
unsuspected thirty-something daughter, drop me a line.</p>

<p>We have the
<a href="http://www.vancouver2010.com/en">2010 Winter Olympics</a> coming.
This is a big-bucks big-politics big-business operation, half the city’s
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/05/31/Gone-World">being ripped apart</a>, and
thus very newsworthy.  Today we learned that the Organizing Committee’s CFO
had quit after 18 months on the job.  I subscribe
to the Vancouver2010 RSS feed, and thus saw the
<a href="http://www.vancouver2010.com/en/OrganizingCommittee/MediaCentre/NewsReleases/2007/06/13/45436_0706131520-776">press release</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>VANOC’s financial leadership structure evolves</b></p>
<p>Following the successful development, approval and release of
its business plan and with its venue construction program on time and on
budget, the Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic
Winter Games (VANOC) today evolved the structure of its financial leadership
team.</p>
<p>“The organization of the 2010 Winter Games is a dynamic project where we
recruit the top talent needed for the work at each critical stage. We are
always looking for ways to ensure we have the right team for the specific
challenges ahead. With a solid financial framework, systems and controls now
in place, we have taken advantage of an opportunity to tighten our senior
management team as we execute our Games business plan,” said John Furlong,
VANOC’s Chief Executive Officer.</p>
<p>Rex McLennan, VANOC’s CFO has decided to return to his earlier successful
career in the mining industry. John McLaughlin assumes leadership of the
Finance and Administration team as Chief Financial Officer. <i>[There’s more,
follow the link above.]</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it just me, or does this mealy-mouthed smooth-as-silk
self-satisfied language sound, well, <em>suspicious</em>?  The instant
I read this I thought <em>Something’s wrong... what’s the real
story?</em></p> 
<p>I suppose it’s possible that it’s all on the up-and-up, that Mr. McLennan
just decided he liked the mining biz better than big-ticket sports.  On the
other hand, maybe VanOC’s facing a financial disaster and McLennan was
pre-emptively fired.  It sure sounds funny.  If it is bad news, it’ll come
out, and all this sweet talk won’t stop it.  If it’s not, why all the
preening?  It’d be perfectly OK to publish a two-liner saying “McLennan went
back to his old job, McLaughlin is replacing him.  Thanks, Rex.”</p>
<p>I hope, I really really hope, that more and more people are thinking like
me and that the shape of conventional PR, as represented by the minor classic
above, will change.</p>

<title>Trouble for Atom</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Yep, ladies and gentlemen, it looks like there’s trouble on the horizon.
On the RFC4287 syndication-format front, it may have been stable since 2005
and widely deployed, but watch out, 
<a href="http://www.cadenhead.org/workbench/news/3222/rss-specification-version-209-published">there’s
a new version of RSS 2.0</a>! (2.0.9, to be precise).  RSS 2.0 is
sort of RFC4287’s main competition, and if there are two different specs, I
guess that must mean it’s twice as good.
On the Atom-Protocol side, Google’s John Panzer has made a
<a href="http://journals.aol.com/panzerjohn/abstractioneer/entries/2007/06/14/is-the-atom-publishing-protocol-the-answer/1449">shocking
discovery</a>, and I quote: “There seems to be a complaint that outside of the tiny corner of the Web comprised of web pages, news stories, articles, blog posts, comments, lists of links, podcasts, online photo albums, video albums, directory listings, search results, ... Atom doesn't match some data models.”

<p>And is there ever a lot of it.  I was going to break this into a handful of
targeted snippets, but anyone who cares about the language would read ’em all
anyhow.  Thus, an illustrated tour through Tokyo conferences, JRuby 1.0,
Refactoring, and M17n.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>JRuby 1.0</h2>
<p>It’s
<a href="http://jruby.codehaus.org/">out</a>.  Doesn’t mean that JRuby’s perfect
yet, but a huge proportion of Ruby code, notably including most Rails apps,
just runs.  Performance is roughly comparable to native Ruby; slower on some
things, faster on others.</p>
<p>The late changes that mattered most were around Java integration, as
featured on the back of the popular JRuby T-shirts:</p>
<blockquote><pre><code>include Java</code></pre></blockquote>
<p>Hadn’t heard about the coolio T-shirts?  Check ’em out.</p>

<p>We don’t know yet how much JRuby is going to matter in the big picture.
But I have to say that if the rest of the OSS community was as cheery and
productive and focused as JRuby, the world would be a better place.</p>
<p>The announcement of JRuby 1.0 happened during the presentation by Charles
Nutter and Thomas Enebo at RubyKaigi2007; let me tell you about that.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Kaigis are Fun</h2>
<p>The weekend featured
<a href="http://jp.rubyist.net/RubyKaigi2007/">RubyKaigi2007</a>.  What a
blast; the (numerous) staff had T-shirts reading “No Ruby, no Life”.</p>
<img src="IMGP5655.jpg" alt="Audience at RubyKaigi2007" />
<p>There were 400 or so attendees and, as is usual with Ruby conferences, it
sold out instantly.  The presentations were all a flat half-hour except for
the keynotes from Matz and Dave Thomas.  That worked better than I would have
thought.
The presentations (in my case seen through the English/Japanese language
barrier) were very good, at least as good as the US RubyConf and probably
better on average than RailsConf (Not surprising, since Ruby is a much
more general-purpose technology than Rails).</p>
<p>I also have to mention how cheery the whole thing was; every single speaker
tried to be funny.  Most of them got some big laughs, and Park Jin from Korea 
absolutely brought the house down with joke that turned out to be
un-translatable.  Technical conferences in general would
benefit from a few more belly-laughs.</p>
<p>I had fun reprising my Ruby-should-do-Unicode-better rant, and who knows,
it may be working, see below.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>The Traditional Approach</h2>
<p>On the Monday after Kaigi, there was another conference,
put on by Sun and
<a href="http://www.ctc-g.co.jp/en/outline.html">CTC</a>, with presentations
from VPs and me and Charles-&amp;-Thomas and Matz.
It was a <em>much</em> more traditional Japanese-business affair, some of the
presos were basically a suit droning away to PowerPoint bullet lists.
Everyone but me and Matz wore suits (I was in 
<a href="http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/abephoto/2007/06/01kariyusi_e.html">Cool
Biz</a> mode).</p>
<p>I injected a little life into the proceedings by falling off the stage.
Really.  There was a big screen at the back; I strolled over to point
at something on one of my slides and all of a sudden there was no stage
underneath me.  I had a moment of raw horror as I looked down and my
stage-light-dazzled eyes saw black emptiness, but fortunately it was only a
drop of a couple of feet.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>From top to bottom: Nutter and Enebo of Sun, Akihito
Fujii of Sun, Seiji Suzuki of CTC, and Matz.</p></div>
<p>Anyhow, the real news story is that, on very short notice, they packed the
joint, could have had way more people if there’d been room; mainstream
corporate Japan is getting the Ruby vibe.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>M17n</h2>
<p>This is short for “Multilingualization”, what Matz has been promising will
be in Ruby 2.0 for some years now.  I have some firm ideas about how M17n
should work (short form: Unicode should not be compulsory, but it should be
easy, correct, and fast).</p>
<p>Anyhow, I was sitting beside Matz in the front row while one of the
less-exciting speakers was speaking, and he popped up an Emacs buffer and said
“Look at this”.  It was his private-sandbox dev version of Ruby, and he showed
me how he could make <code>String#length</code> and <code>String#strip</code>
work properly with UTF-8 data.  There’s a new method called (I think) <code>String#bytesize</code>.</p>
<p>I gather that the idea is that there’ll be a pragma you can assert per-file
or per-IO or per-socket to specify the character encoding from that data
source, and then everything will Just Work.
We agreed that for the cases where you just don’t know, it would nice for
someone to translate Python’s
<a href="http://chardet.feedparser.org/">Universal Encoding Detector</a> to
Ruby.  I might be tempted to try that if nobody else has.</p>
<p>This cheers me up immensely. I also think it’s the single piece of Ruby 2.0
that’s most likely to make the next version attractive to the Rails
developers.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Refactoring!</h2>
<p>Hopping back to this side of the Pacific, and in a completely different
space, check out Tor Norbye’s latest on
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/tor/entry/ruby_screenshot_of_the_week12">refactoring
Ruby in NetBeans</a>.</p>
<p>He’s getting close to having a usable “Find Usages”, and that’s kind of the
holy grail. With it, you can do any number of serious refactorings; without
it, you can’t really do any.  Stay tuned.</p>
<p>It’s a fine, fine time to be a Rubyist.</p>

<title>東京 II: Eating</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Among all the astounding things about Tokyo, for me the single most
astounding is the food business.  The number of restaurants and cafés and
lunch counters and bakeries and bars and street vendors beggars description.
In my experience, most of them are good.</p>
<img src="IMGP5731.jpg" alt="Closing time, somewhere in Shibuya" />
<p>On this trip, I got off the JR once at the wrong station, fairly late at
night, and didn’t realise
it.  I thought “I don’t recognize this exit, I’ll just orbit the station
till I spot a landmark”.  Which didn’t work that well, I was wandering down
back streets off back streets.  And every other building on every little alley
had an a couple of places to eat.  And in every one of them there were people
eating.</p>
<p>Another story.  When I was heading home, I decided to take the airport bus
from my hotel, departing at 12:50.  I got to the hotel at 12:10 or so and
bought a ticket and felt hungry.  I looked at the high prices and boring fare
in the lobby café and headed out.
Across the way
<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=35.655936,139.698721&amp;spn=0.002188,0.003707&amp;t=h&amp;z=18&amp;om=1&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=104115976109836256502.000001132d828001d8615">there was a little square</a>
with some benches and shade, and on the street were parked three separate
trucks selling box lunches out the back; also a more formal cart with an
umbrella, but the truck guys’ food looked better: rice, fried egg, a couple
of mini-salads and four mystery-meat patties for ¥500.  Tasty!</p>

<p>Finally, on my trip to Japan, it became clear that the hot new pocket cam
is totally the Ricoh GX-100.  Two or three different heavy geeks I ran across
are using it; with the notable exception of
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/akihito/">Akihito Fujii</a>, who has the
even-more-esoteric Ricoh GR Digital, and let me know he didn’t think much of
the GX-100’s zoom lens.</p>
<img src="IMGP5832.jpg" alt="Japanese tech journalists at work" />
<p>Above, a scene from an interview I did with three Japanese tech
journalists, showing a GX-100 in action.  <em>Aaaack!</em> I can’t find their
name-cards!  The fellow closest to the camera is Tomihisa Fuon, I know that
because he’s
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/05/14/Tokyo-People">appeared here
before</a>.
<i>[Is this cool or what:
<a href="http://yohei-y.blogspot.com/">Yohei Yamamoto</a>, who works for Ricoh
and is the person in the middle, writes a comment below identifying himself and
the photographer, who is Inao-san, editor of <cite>Web+DB Press</cite>.  Thank
you Yamamoto-san, and I’m terribly sorry about misplacing the cards. And of
course I should have said that the man in the background at the left is
H. Tony Sugimoto, of Sun PR in Japan.]</i></p> 
<p>Anyhow, one or two of my colleagues let me fondle their GX-100s, and I
looked at one in Yodabashi’s Akihabara store, but I’m glad I didn’t buy it
because it’s a lot cheaper this side of the Pacific.</p>
<p>That’s if you can get one; the exclusive US importer is
<a href="http://www.adorama.com/">Adorama</a> and they’re sold out.  There are
a few out there on EBay though.</p>
<p>The ergonomics are just delicious, but peeking in the
<a href="http://forums.dpreview.com/forums/forum.asp?forum=1013">DPReview
Ricoh Forum</a> reveals one big downside: it’s pig-slow writing RAW pictures
to the card.  Also some reliability problems.  Still, it’s nice that at least
one manufacturer cares about making something that fits in your pocket and
still appeals to photo-geeks.</p>

<title>東京 III: Traveling</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Tokyo is huge any way you measure; one of the world’s largest cities by
population and not built up that high, so it sprawls forever across the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kant%C5%8D_region">Kantō plain</a>.
Even the city’s core, 
which I would roughly say is everything inside the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamanote_Line">Yamanote JR Line</a> or
walkable from one of its stations, is pretty vast.  Most times, though, you
don’t notice because everywhere you go, you go by train, often underground or
with not much of a view.</p>
<p>It works astoundingly well; not only can you get anywhere in a reasonable
amount of time, with only a little practice you can learn to estimate pretty
well and reliably show up for a meeting on time.</p>
<img src="IMGP5923.jpg" alt="Two levels of traffic in Tokyo" />
<p>The planners who plan all this, and the managers who keep it running, and
the engineers who fix it when it breaks; all of these people, whom I expect
are entirely unknown, ought by any sane standard to be heroes of the Japanese
nation.  Their accomplishments, I think, are unequaled anywhere in the
world.</p>
<p>I’d really, really love to learn about their IT set-up.</p>

<title>東京 IV: Phoning</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Here’s a travel tip: When you go to Japan, rent a phone!  It doesn’t cost
too much money or time and it simplifies life incredibly.  With remarks on
Japanese phone culture and a completely unrelated picture.</p>
<img src="IMGP5678.jpg" alt="The big incense pot at Sensō-ji in Asakusa" />
<div class="caption"><p>The biggest of the incense-burning pots at 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensoji">Sensō-ji</a> in
Asakusa.</p></div>
<p>Back to phones now.  First of all, yours won’t work there.
GSM? Hah. There are traces of CDMA I hear, but basically, the only phone that
works in Japan is a Japanese phone.</p>
<p>I poked around on the Web;
<a href="http://www.narita-airport.jp/en/">Narita airport</a> even has a list
of on-site phone-rental shops, but it’s at an unstable-looking URI, so track
it down yourself.  I never got around to reserving a phone, but found myself
walking by one of the booths on the way to the ATM, and they rented me one
for a few bucks a day with no fuss and no muss, the whole transaction taking
maybe five minutes.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Why You Need It</h2>
<p>Meeting people in Tokyo is difficult.  It’s almost always at a train
station, but these are big complicated beasts, so unless you’re super-careful
to specify <em>exactly</em> where, you can miss each other.
Also some station names sound like others, and maybe they meant the subway
station, not the JR station of the same name in almost the same place.  If
you’ve got a phone, you’re good, you can sync up.</p>
<p>Also, it turns out that every Japanese phone, without exception, is an
email device, and for six days in Tokyo, I could send and receive email at
&lt;10-digit-number>@docomo.ne.jp; very handy indeed.  Quite a few of them
were to people in Pacific Time, of the form “Are you awake?”
I wasted some time trying to figure out
how to get SMS going, but it turns out that email-on-the-phone came in so
early in Japan, and was implemented well enough, that SMS is almost unheard
of.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Mods</h2>
<p>However, I did <em>not</em> adopt Japanese mobile-phone culture entirely.
That would have required a couple of mods to the phone.  First, a dangly
little loop of feathers, jewels, Hello Kitty, and other decorations.  Second a
dangling extra-battery pack so you can play games or read books or email your
friends continuously on your two-hour train commute.  Which nearly everybody
does.</p>

<title>“X Me” is a Facebook Virus</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A friend on Facebook invited me to try the “X Me” application.  It sounded
a little silly but it was a person I respect, so I clicked on it.  As soon as
it installed, it popped up a list of more or less everyone I knew asking if it
was OK to mail invitations to them.  I said “no”, and then (weirdly) it popped
up one other name and I said “no” again.  Now I’m getting messages from
people asking if I really think they should install “X Me”.  This, obviously,
is a virus.</p>
<p>As of now, I ain’t installing <em>any</em> Facebook apps unless someone I
know and trust lets me know, in a personal and one-to-one way, that they’re
using it and it works as advertised and isn’t a scummy virus.</p>
<p>In Facebook, nobody can hear you scream. Except your “friends”.  A blog is
different.</p>

<title>Fathers’ Day</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The media are full of heartfelt pieces about Fatherhood;
<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/15/AR2007061501977.html?nav=rss_opinion/columns">here</a>
is my favorite this year.  I find myself, as a practitioner,
feeling like an impostor, but so do many fathers.</p>
<p>What can a father offer?  (Let us leave unaddressed how this differs from
the corresponding list for a mother because I’m generalizing from the
specific: what can <em>I</em> offer?)  I can
cuddle.  I can listen.  I can sympathize.  I can teach.  And I
can laugh.  Which of these is best?</p>
<p>Examples are better than principles. We were cleaning up after a party
Saturday which involved lots of kids and thus balloons, which
had to be taken down and either taken home or popped.  My
almost-eight-year-old boy got into the popping-balloons thing with a
vengeance.</p>  
<p><i>[Oops, I sense a digression.</i>] My Mom has told me of a time
when I was really little, of
being in a supermarket when they let down many balloons from the ceiling, and
if you popped them were prizes (for example “free groceries”) inside, and
everyone started popping them and they had to take me outside because I had
hysterics and wet my pants.</p>
<p>Anyhow, my son, who has a strong sense of his own heroism, leapt on
a big balloon with both feet, but it
didn’t pop so he rebounded full-length on the (fortunately
carpeted) floor, receiving a severe blow to the back of the head, which
evolution, guided by experience as to the behavior of young specimens of
<cite>Homo 
sapiens</cite>, has equipped with lots of shielding.</p>
<p>But there was my boy lying on his back, hurt and crying.  Without thinking
I picked him up and without thinking his head was on my shoulder taking, I
fiercely believe, some comfort.
Comfort is good, but so is laughter, maybe better.
One of the really big lessons for a young person is: <em>shit happens</em>.
When it does,
if you can possibly arrange to laugh at it, that’s almost always the best
thing to do.  It establishes (depending on the listener’s mood) that you
are courageous or witty or fun to be around.  These are all much
better than the alternatives.</p>
<p>This same boy on Friday fell out of a tree and picked up a really
dramatic-looking cut down the side of his face.  So I’ve been having great
fun telling everyone that he got in a swordfight with a vicious pirate.
Which he enjoys debunking every time, but not
without snickers.  Snickers are good.</p>
<p>At the end of the day we and any Gods we believe in face
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnar%C3%B6k">Ragnarök</a>, and
laughing in its face is the way to go.</p>
<p>So when my children are hurt I pick them up and comfort them as best I can
(not as well as their mother) but also I try to help them see
how falling off a party balloon is funny, and how seeing that can really
help.</p>
<p>Humor is the ultimate self-defense for the soul.</p>

<title>東京 V: Playing</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I don’t know what Japan’s largest export is, but I think its most important
export is culture.  Pop culture to be precise; there are few places 
where as you walk the streets you see things you’ll see
on fashion catwalks and in TV-show backdrops and and
<a href="http://www.papermag.com/?section=magazine">Paper</a> pages
this time next year; and Tokyo is one of them.</p>
<img src="IMGP5702.jpg" alt="Pikachu, the fat and ugly version" />
<div class="caption"><p>Pikachu, the not-so-<i>kawaii</i> version.</p></div>
<p>This time, the photos are from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihabara">Akihabara</a>, which gets
more interesting every year.  It’s always been a nerve center for electronics
geeks, and I’m one I suppose, but I’ve always found the atmosphere unpleasant and
the selection repetitious and the prices atrocious.  In particular, you can
see some weird high-end audio shit there, but it’s stacked up against a wall
under fluorescent light in a charmless room with no comfy chairs in front to
listen to music in.</p>
<p>Now, Akihabara has become a hot locus for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otaku">Otaku</a> nerds and the
related-but-distinct
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosplay">Cosplay</a> culture.
The micro-micro-economics are complex, but the symptom is simple: they show up
in surprising outfits and encourage you to take their picture, in exchange
for, well, that’s less obvious.</p>
<img src="IMGP5705.jpg" alt="Young women posing for the camera in Akihabara"/>
<p>The picture above is a scene I didn’t understand; these two very young
women maintained these poses while dozens of camera geeks clustered to
photograph them.  They were engaged in the process, intently reviewing albums
and proof-sheets and printouts of photos of themselves, autographing some of
them.  I saw no advertising or money changing hands.
Might any of my commenters know what’s up?  For example, are they
aspiring stars promoting their careers?</p>
<p>Now, here’s just a bunch of kids looking cool.</p>
<img src="IMGP5709.jpg" alt="Sharp-dressed youngsters in Akihabara" />
<p>Hard-core gadget geeks can still come here, they’ve got ’em all, but I
don’t think its a good place for a <i>gaijin</i> to shop, the sticker prices
are just not competitive with the rest of the world, so you have to know how
to route around that.</p>
<p>There was one class of transaction that I understood, because they write it
up in the
<a href="http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/">Daily Yomiuri</a> while I was there:
Hot chick dresses up for the photo-geeks, but in exchange for photos they have
to take leaflets for local Cosplay-supply stores.</p>
<img src="IMGP5714.jpg" alt="Cosplay-supply saleswoman in Akihabara" />
<p>If you’re going to go to a faraway land and put up with all the travel
bullshit, at the very least you want to be surprised when you get there.
Tokyo never fails.</p>

<title>Web3S</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Well, well, we now have two freshly-baked HTTP-based Web Resource CRUD
protocols which advertise themselves as being RESTful.  Microsoft’s new
Web3S is designed to support remote update of Live Contacts, which is, and I
quote: “the central data store in Windows Live for address book
information. All Hotmail contacts, Messenger buddies and Spaces’ friends are
recorded in Live Contacts. There are currently approximately 500,000,000
active address books in Live Contacts.”
See Yaron Goland’s intro
<a href="http://www.goland.org/appanddare/">APP and Dare, the sitting duck</a>
(read the comments too),
then the draft spec 
<a href="http://dev.live.com/livedata/web3s.htm">Web Structured, Schema’d
&amp; Searchable (Web3S)</a>
and its
<a href="http://dev.live.com/livedata/web3sFAQ.htm">FAQ</a>.
There’s a reaction from David Ing,

the comments below might be a good place to aggregate more links.
<i>[Update: Yaron Goland has addressed the issues I raised here, FAQ-style, in
a
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/06/17/Web3S#c1182902042.589512">comment
below.</a>]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-1'>History</h2>
<p>With all due respect to Yaron, it is really unfortunate that the first time
the world heard of Web3S it was in a post of Dare’s aimed at explaining APP’s
failings, which unfortunately revealed that he hadn’t read the spec and didn’t
understand it.  The treatment he got, especially from me, was pretty harsh;
but then the
post was pretty clueless, and in my experience Dare normally isn’t, so Occam’s
razor naturally generated suspicion of what lay behind the content.</p>
<p>And guys, if you’re going to work at Microsoft, you’ll just have to accept
that you’re in a world where you’re routinely suspected of the worst.  It’s
too late to go back and change the history that led here; they
teach distrust-of-Microsoft as an MBA-level business basic these days.
Learn to deal with it or find a new job.</p>
<p>It might have been nice if the Live team had, you know, actually tried
interacting with the other group which was noisily and in public designing a
general-purpose REST-based protocol, but that’s water under the bridge.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Elephant in the Room</h2>
<p>Um... LDAP?  I thought the technology for accessing and maintaining online
address-books and directories was kind of well-established and there were lots
of perfectly good commercial products that exist to do just this.  Why
re-invent the world?  Anyhow, this deserves an entry in the FAQ.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Web3S</h2>
<p>I spent an hour with the spec and the FAQ and, while there are things that
make you go “Huh!?” there’s nothing obviously insane.
If you decide you totally can’t model your world as collections of entries
populated with hyperlinks to express relationships, well then I guess
APP’s not for you.  And at the level of engineering intuition, I have to say
that a monster online address book does feel different at a deep level from
most online “publications” (I thought that was why we had LDAP... but I repeat
myself).</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>A Suggestion for the Web3S Team</h2>
<p>Get yourself a test suite!  APP has already been helped by the existence of
code from Joe Gregorio, me, and others.  Test suites matter way more than specs, in the
big picture.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Design Notes</h2>
<p>This is not a comprehensive technical review; I’m too overloaded for a
deep-dive right now.  Rather, it’s a series of half-cooked questions that went
through my mind as I read the spec &amp; FAQ.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>LDAP? (See above).</p></li>
<li><p>XML and JSON... why not just use JSON?  Having two serializations makes
implementors’ work twice as difficult, and forces spec-writers into 
stinky contortions and abstractions like EII and SII; the APP spec gets to
talk just 
about “elements” and “attributes” and is easier to read.  I don’t see where,
in an LDAP-like protocol, you’d need “document-like” constructs, they look
mostly like relational data records; so I’d just just wrap ’em in JSON,
which means you get compulsory UTF-8 too, further simplifying implementors’
lives.</p></li>
<li><p>If you’re going to abstract your data store as a big XML doc, mightn’t
XQuery be useful?  There’s already some talk of XPath.</p></li>
<li><p>Damn, those are some butt-ugly URIs.  I guess having a straight formal
mapping from data model to URI simplifies things, though, and I suspect that
people mostly won’t see them anyhow.  Addressability is good.</p></li>
<li><p>I’m having trouble sorting out this reverse-domain-name to
XML-namespace mapping.  In the example, you have:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;LiveContacts xmlns=”Web3SBase:com.live.livecontacts”
              xmlns:Web3S = “Web3S:”>
   …
   &lt;Contacts></code></pre>
<p>But then shouldn’t the namespace of the <code>Contacts</code> element be
<code>com.live.livecontacts.contacts</code>?  Needs more digging.</p>
<p>Also, I suspect the invention of a new URI scheme is really
misbegotten.  But tons of engineering groups make that particular mistake.
You might want to consult
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#URI-scheme">Webarch §2.4</a> on this
subject.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In Example 2, they say “the ID is intentionally omitted” but in fact it
seems to be there in a slightly variant form, 123A instead of 123ABC.  Error?
Or just a little more explanation needed?</p></li>
<li><p>I really have trouble believing that inventing the new UPDATE HTTP
method is a good idea.  
They want to do a potentially complicated in-place update of their data
structure while preserving schema-validity, which is perfectly reasonable.  
Furthermore, they define a “delta” data type to be used to accomplish this,
which seems really architecturally sound.</p>
<p>So why not just use POST?  All it does is say “I’m going to change the
state of the system in a way that depends on lots more than just the
verb.”  You’re not going to be able to understand the change anyhow without a
full implementation of Web3S semantics, so what value is gained by having the
verb be UPDATE instead of POST?</p>
<p>Introducing a new HTTP verb to the Web infrastructure (firewall
administrators will just love you) and to the HTTP libraries of C, C++ C#,
Perl, Python, Ruby, Java, and all the other languages people use is a <em>big
fucking deal</em>, and it would be really nice not to go there.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Order matters on the wire but not on disk?  Yow, my brain hurts.</p></li>
<li><p>This notion of “annotation” is hard to understand, maybe they should
start with some motivating examples of why you’d want this and what you’re
trying to accomplish.</p></li>
<li><p>Open Issue 3SAFR on white-space... not sure why this is hard.  You have
to be clear about grammar rules inside your elements, but who cares what if
any WS occurs between them?</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-7'>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I’m an APP partisan, but I’m a bigger REST partisan.  I’m not close enough
to the Live Contacts problem to have a useful technical opinion on how to
solve it, or whether it needs something new as opposed to something that’s
already here.  But if they need to invent a Web interface I think it’s smart to
make it RESTful.</p>
<p>Good luck to them; they’ll need it, and a test suite too.</p>

<title>Oops</title>

<body>
<p>It turns out that sometime in recent months, I made a little adjustment to
the comments system that locked some but not all users of Microsoft Internet
Explorer out.  It was a major pain in the butt to track down, but I
<em>think</em> I have.  I don’t have that many Windows configurations in the
house to test with, so I’d sure appreciate it if a few of you out there
looking at <span class='o'>ongoing</span> through IE would, first of all, go 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/06/18/Oops">here</a> (just the standalone version of this entry, please go
there now); and once you’ve gone there, cast your eyes at the bottom of the
page and see if there’s an invitation to contribute a comment.  If there is,
I’d then appreciate it if you could you click on it and submit a couple of
witty words to see if they show up.  If there’s no invitation or the comment
won’t submit or something else weird happens, do please drop me an email
(remember, <i>first</i>.<i>last</i>@sun.com) and let me know the symptoms and
what versions of IE and Windows are in play.
<i>[Update: OK, thanks.  I watched the logfiles as dozens of people popped up
the comment form and a handful or two actually submitted comments; I stopped
approving the ones of the form “Yep, it works” after a while.  I have no
complaining emails.  Thanks all!]</i></p>
<p>You may think the comment form looks lousy in IE. That’s because it looks
lousy in most browsers; beautification is on the to-do list.</p>

<title>東京 VI: Recharging</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Tokyo is big and fast and intense and it’ll make you tired.  And, many
months of the year, hot and sweaty too.  Fortunately, it offers a solution for
these problems.</p>
<p>Here’s how big:</p>
<img src="IMGP5845.jpg" alt="Central Tokyo, seen from Southwest Tokyo" />
<img src="IMGP5850.jpg" alt="Central Tokyo, seen from Southwest Tokyo" />
<p>The solution: more or less everywhere you go, there are vending machines.
In every vending machine, you can, for ¥100 ± ¥20, buy <i>iced
coffee</i>.  It is really strong and really cold and really sweet and has
<em>a whole lot of caffeine</em>.  If they took the vending machines away,
Tokyo would grind to a halt, I’m convinced.</p>
<p>On another subject, those impressive views of Tokyo are from Sun’s big Tokyo
office, which is at a subway station named Yoga, full address 4-10-1
Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, but I can’t convince either Yahoo! or Google maps to show
it to me.  It’s a little bit further than you’d like from downtown, but is the
view ever wonderful.</p>

<p>Unless you’ve spent some quality time doing Web traffic analysis, this will
probably be gibberish to you.</p>

<title>東京 VII: Drinking</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The last couple of months I’ve been in both Tokyo and London, and I visit
Silicon Valley all the time.  Tokyo and London are like each other, and unlike
the Valley, in that they have a business-drinking culture.  Maybe it’s as
simple as the fact that in the Valley you have to drive everywhere, and you’d
have to be pretty booze-hungry, or just suicidal, to load up before getting
behind the wheel on 280 or 85 or 237 or 101.</p>
<p>There are differences.  In London, you go
the pub after work and throw down beers, then eventually stagger off for a
very late supper.  In Tokyo, you meet for dinner after work and have
beer and sake and shochu with your food.  I like the Japanese style way
better, even though Britain has more interesting beer.</p>
<p>Here’s a basic Japanese-drinking skill.  
When you’ve had enough, you have
to stop drinking with your glass full, because otherwise it’ll just get filled
up again.  More than one <i>gaijin</i> businessman has been carried home
because he didn’t know this.</p>
<p>I like a drink, or sometimes five, and I really like the combination of
beer and sake and Japanese cuisine.
But toward the end of the week,
I was leaving my glass full fairly early because man, I was tired,
Tokyo will do that to you.</p>
<p>We had dinner one night at <i>Nin-Nin Honpo</i>, advertised as a “Ninja-style”
izikaya.  The food was good (nothing unusual, but good) and our
waitress was adorably cute in ninja gear.  You have to point your finger and exclaim
“Nin nin!” at certain points in the meal.  One of the sushi boats was full of
dry ice, which poured smoke all over the table.  Later on in the meal,
everyone well-lubricated, they brought a katana to the table.</p>
<img src="IMGP5804.jpg" alt="Tim with a katana at Nin Nin Honpo" />
<p>I was trying to pick up a piece of sushi way over there, which
everyone thought was really funny, but I dropped it on someone else’s plate.
A good thing too, what was I going to do, stick the end of the sword in my
mouth?</p>
<p>The ninja joint was in 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roppongi">Roppongi</a>, a district I
instantly disliked when I first came to Tokyo many years ago, and I still do.  
Yeah, the architecture is cheerfully garish, but the scene on the street
outside the hostess bars gets way over my sleaze boundaries.  Maybe I’m
secretly a prude.</p>
<img src="IMGP5791.jpg" alt="Roppongi" />
<p>What’s the deal with all the hostess-bar touts who are sharp-dressed black
guys? 
That’s getting culturally complex.</p>

<p>These are eventful times in the world of Web technologies.

On the lighter side, check out DeWitt Clinton’s excellent

Finally, Doug Purdy, longtime shaper of Microsoft’s view of the Web, is back

<title>東京 VIII: Shopping</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Whatever you may say about Tokyo, whether you like it or not, it’s a great
place to shop.  For selection not bargains; there is lots of stuff you just
won’t find anywhere else.</p>
<p>I thought I should pick up something for my kids, so I went to
<a href="http://www.kiddyland.co.jp/en/">Kiddy Land</a> near Omotesando; it’s
pretty amazing.  When you walk in it seems kind of cramped, but then you
realize that it’s five or six stories tall.
There’s some really original stuff, but most toys these days are related to a
movie or a TV show or whatever.
I got the boy a couple of cool T-shirts which I suppose are related to
something but I had no idea what it was; he liked them.  For the baby girl, I
got a stuffed
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totoro">Totoro</a> the size of her head;
it’s adorable, another success.</p>
<p>Kiddy Land was good but that part of Tokyo is boring; luxury designer
stores you can find in any prosperous city.  Later that day we visited
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asakusa">Asakusa</a> (it’s already
appeared in this illustrated series).  Here are a couple of shots from the
temple complex.</p>
<img src="IMGP5683.jpg" alt="Asakusa temple roof" />
<img src="IMGP5687.jpg" alt="Statue robed in red in Asakusa" />
<p>Just outside the covered market, we found a store
that was essentially a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Ghibli">Studio Ghibli</a>
specialist.  I feel a little hypocritical because I run screaming in the other
direction when I see a Disney store in a mall; how can this be different?</p>
<p>Well, it was in a nothing location, not a mall.  It was a hole-in-the-wall,
not spacious or gleaming.  And they had the <em>cutest</em> stuff; lots of
variations on Totoro, but other stuff too, my favorite were the little black
fuzzy things with eyes, the coal-carriers from <cite>Spirited Away</cite>.</p>

motivated by the discovery that the about-to-be-published

Check out the dialogue with the editor, and then some of the comments are worth
reading too.  My take-away: Depressing.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>On the Practical Side</h2>
<p>There were some reactions to that big devChix post I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/06/14/DevChix">mentioned earlier</a>.
In <a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/archives/2007/06/14/tech-women/">Tech Women</a>
Lauren Wood writes from the perspective of a women who’s always been a
singleton among professional males.</p>
<p>For me, the most engaging new contribution is 
Jeni Tenison’s <a href="http://www.jenitennison.com/blog/node/30">How to get women into computing</a>,
which offers a lot of thoughtful clarity, along with
some practical suggestions.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Speaking of Close to Home</h2>
<p>Now that I’m down at the bottom of an article that probably few will read,
I guess I can raise one of the issues I had with the
<a href="http://www.devchix.com/2007/06/09/let%e2%80%99s-all-evolve-past-this-the-barriers-women-face-in-tech-communities/">devChix piece</a>.  It goes
on at some length about how if we want women as co-workers, we shouldn’t ever
even think about approaching them romantically.</p>
<p>Er, um, hmm.</p>
<p>When my first marriage broke up in the Nineties, I pretty quickly decided I
didn’t like being single and set out to fix the problem.  Most of the women I
happened to meet, I met professionally.  I asked lots out and
romanced a few and married one ten years ago and have two children.
The process seemed to have a satisfactory outcome.</p>
<p>So I’m not neutral at all.  I really hope that “gloriajw” over at devChix
is wrong about this.  Obviously you have to be able to take “no” for an answer,
and shouldn’t be pushy or slimy.
But look, dammit, we don’t have church socials and matchmakers any
more.  If we can’t date the people we meet at work, the species is
gonna bloody well die out.</p>

<title>東京 IX: Working</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is just a thank-you to a few of my Tokyo colleagues, but it has my favorite
picture from the whole trip.</p>
<p>All these pictures were taken at a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabu-shabu">Shabu-shabu</a> restaurant
down a back street off a back street somewhere in Shibuya.  I hadn’t had
Shabu-shabu in years, and it’d been a long day and I was starving and it was
good; Charles 
Nutter (he was sitting opposite) and I polished off maybe two or three more
platters of meat than was strictly necessary, and I had some surprising dreams
and digestive sensations that night.</p>
<p>The first picture is
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/shita/">Takashi Shitamichi</a>, who organized our
time in Tokyo; he did a fantastic job, setting us up with interesting people
doing interesting things; we learned a lot and I hope we managed to leave some
useful ideas behind. He’s hard-working, smart, and an old Unix hacker; what’s
not to like?  Thank-you Takashi!</p>
<img src="IMGP5728.jpg" alt="Takashi Shitamichi" />
<p>Also out at that restaurant was
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/okazaki/">Takayuki Okazaki</a>, who introduced
me to the pleasures of fondling a Ricoh GX-100.  In fact, you can see his
pictures of RubyKaigi and that dinner, one taken by me with the Ricoh,
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/okazaki/entry/ruby%E4%BC%9A%E8%AD%B02007_2%E6%97%A5%E7%9B%AE%E3%81%AE%E6%97%A5%E6%9B%9C%E6%97%A5">here</a>.</p>
<img src="IMGP5724.jpg" alt="Takayuki Okazaki" />
<p>Our other host that evening was
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/katakai/">Masaki Katakai</a>; he’s also got
pictures of the conference and the dinner and so on if you scroll down.
The picture of Masaki-san is maybe my favorite from the Tokyo trip.</p>

<title>Good and Bad</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A question occurred to me while I was speaking at the really excellent
Seattle
<a href="http://www.aneventapart.com/">Event Apart</a>; if you’re a Web
designer and there’s one in your neighborhood, I recommend it highly.</p>
<p>Go surfing around the 
Long Tail and look at a few dozen of the interesting, valuable websites you
find there, on sex or politics or knitting or cameras or music or, well,
anything.  Most of ’em look like ass. 
Then go to a bookstore and look at some bad books; Harlequin Romances, say,
or anything involving Tom Clancy.  They’ll usually have well-designed, catchy
covers and effective typography.  So here’s the question:</p>
<p><i>Why do good web-sites look bad while bad books look good?</i></p>

<title>東京 X: Researching</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last Monday, we spent some time at the
<a href="http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index_e.html">University of Tokyo</a>, where
we talked about Ruby and so on; quite a change of pace from the rest of the
visit.</p>
<p>We’re talking about maybe funding some joint R&amp;D; here we have Nutter
and Enebo, the JRuby guys, doing some white-boarding with
<a href="http://www.atdot.net/~ko1/diary/">Koichi Sasada</a>, also known as
“Ko1 the YARV guy”.</p>
<img src="IMGP5808.jpg" alt="Nutter, Enebo, and Sasada at the Whiteboard" />
<p>Also in that meeting was this charming older gentleman who asked how many
of us were going to be getting business cards, pulled out a little pen-and-ink
set, and hand-lettered his name into a space in the middle for each of us.</p>
<p>That’s a collector’s item, because he turned out to be Ikuo Takeuchi (竹内
郁雄), best known as the inventor of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tak_%28function%29">Tak function</a>.
Definitely an unexpected pleasure.</p>
<img src="IMGP5809.jpg" alt="Prof. Ikuo Takeuchi" />
<p>We had lunch at a nice little on-campus restaurant, then I gave a lecture
on what’s new and Web 2.0 and all that jazz.  It was packed, and the questions
were <em>intelligent</em>.  I learned that they’ve started teaching first-year
undergrads Ruby instead of Java, and that Prof. Ko1 is doing some of the
teaching.  Wish I’d learned programming that way. [My first taste was FORTRAN
tought by a useless drug hippie.]</p>
<p>The campus is a nice green academic oasis; central Tokyo needs all the green
calm it can get.  Here’s the central building, which I gather
symbolizes the University.</p>
<img src="IMGP5826.jpg" alt="Tower at the center of the University of Tokyo" />
<p>Outside the University’s Red Gate, facing yet another busy grey concrete Tokyo
streetscape, is this:</p>

<title>People-Ready Elephant</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Everyone has heard about the
<a href="http://valleywag.com/tech/spokesbloggers/microsoft-pays-star-writers-to-recite-slogan-271485.php">People-Ready
controversy</a> by now.  John Battelle, sitting at the center of the storm,
<a href="http://www.federatedmedia.net/blog/archives/2007/06/a_follow_up.php">takes
up the issue</a> and sounds a defiant note: “But to sum up, I refuse to
declare conversational marketing a bad idea because of one storm.”</p>
<p>I think that there’s an elephant in this room: namely, that the Microsoft
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/business/peopleready/default.mspx">People-Ready</a>
marketing campaign is paralyzingly stupid and lame. 
Thus, a bunch of allegedly-intelligent allegedly-leading voices of the
blogosphere suddenly
<a href="http://www.peoplereadybusiness.federatedmedia.net/archives/74">singing
in the chorus</a>
totally fails to pass the sniff test; in fact, it stinks to high heaven.
There are marketing campaigns that could—in fact there are campaigns
that <em>have</em>—raised a chorus of blog voices in admiration and support.
But while Microsoft has many strengths, they have not in recent years included
marketing or messaging.</p>
<p>So, while I think the storm that broke out, and the consequences, were
inevitable and appropriate, I also wonder whether it would have blown so high
had the campaign been something intelligent, say Apple arguing things should
Just Work or we at Sun arguing that servers should have a smaller carbon
footprint.</p>
<p>But then, I’m paranoid and cynical.</p>

<title>Mideast Roundup</title>

<p>In recent months the situation in the Middle East, particularly on the
Israel/Palestine front, has managed to get continuously worse.  For the
ordinary people there who are engaged in trying to have decent lives, this is
an appalling and it seems endless tragedy.  One small silver lining is that
the desperation has provoked some commentary from insiders on all sides that
seems better, more urgent, less packaged, than usual.  Quite a bit of this
will probably vanish behind one paywall or another, but if you want to be
disturbed, depressed, and educated here are a few voices worth reading.</p>

<title>東京 XI: Lounging</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>On the Tuesday evening before I left, we had some pure fun, attending the 
“Developer’s Lounge”, organized by Sun but attended by a menagerie of
geeks, every flavor.  Think of a short unconference with free food and
beer.</p>
<p>The tone was, to use an old word, jolly.  Which is a word I that often goes
through my mind when thinking of Japanese culture.  The difference is, younger
geeks in general and the Ruby community in particular take it further, just a
damn cheerful bunch of people, and a pleasure to be with.  I think this
picture captures some of it.</p>
<img src="IMGP5876.jpg" alt="Tokyo Developers’ Lounge" />
<p>There wasn’t a single droning speaker.  Mind you, there was nothing like a
podium, just a projector balanced on a stool, you balanced your laptop on
another to plug in, and then you had to compete with a bunch of well-oiled
geeks who’d be just as happy to argue with each other about Web frameworks as
listen to you.</p>
<p>I don’t know who this fellow is, but that’s what it was like.</p>
<img src="IMGP5905.jpg" alt="Speaker at the Tokyo Developer’s Lounge" />
<h2 id='p-1'>My Talk</h2>
<p>I gave 15 minutes on the Atom Publishing Protocol.  I talk the APP up a lot
these days, but it’s mostly sociological arm-waving about what it means.  I
was tired of that, and these guys were geeks, so I pointed the Ape at Joe
Gregorio’s test server and walked them through the HTTP back-and-forth, blow
by blow, explaining what was happening.</p>
<p>It was a blast.  I’ll be honest; quite a few of the faces had expressions
that I guess meant “WTF is this deranged gaijin doing showing screens-full of
angle brackets and HTTP headers?!?”  But then there were some other faces who
obviously actually understood HTTP and you could see them getting it right
there and then. I think I’ll have to do this talk format more often.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Mastermind</h2>
<p>The lounge is the creation of Akihito Fujii.</p>

a bit).  This event is a totally wonderful idea; we at Sun should do this in a
lot more cities (or if we don’t, someone else should).</p>
<p>If you’re in Tokyo, I totally recommend the Lounge.  It’s invitation-only,
so you’ll have to send Fujii-san a note.  Remember, <i>first</i>.<i>last</i>@sun.com.</p>

<p>Yahoo’s
<a href="http://yodel.yahoo.com/author/jerry-yang/">new CEO</a> sure hasn’t
been getting much respect, I’m not gonna link 
to the put-downs but you’ve probably seen them.  I think most of these people
don’t know Jerry.  Back in the mid-Nineties, I got to know him pretty well
when my then-employer Open Text had a Yahoo partnership.  I quickly became
convinced that even if he hadn’t stumbled into the Yahoo directory rocket-ride
(it used to
be a directory, anyone remember?) Jerry would have had a brilliant
business career.  He’s smart and a good communicator and open-minded and
really understands the Web better than any dozen grizzled senior business
types.  In terms of generic-executive skills, probably he learned a lot
from Semel and his predecessor Tim Koogle.  I think a bet against Yahoo and
Jerry might not be very smart right around now.</p>

<title>東京 XII: Changing</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’ve been coming to Tokyo since 1991 or so, and while Japanese culture is
often called insular and set-in-its-ways, the changes have been dramatic.</p>
<img src="IMGP5697.jpg" alt="The market at Asakusa" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Gaijin</h2>
<p>There are so many more foreigners now than then, and they seem better
integrated.  Instead of the baffled-looking businessman sweating together in
twos and threes with the locals routing round them, you see slackers on the
subways reading manga and banging away on their
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_mobile_phone_culture">keitai</a>, generally being
ignored, part of the urban landscape.</p>
<p>It’s rare to spend five minutes on the street anywhere in central Tokyo
without seeing faces that are pale or black; or often you’ll be in a crowd
and realise that the Asian-looking people dressed to you, who look and are
dressed just like everyone else, are talking something that’s not Japanese.
I’m not 100% on spotting those languages, but I distinctly heard some Mandarin
and Cantonese; the ones I didn’t recognize could be Korean or Vietnamese or
anything else really.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Less Different</h2>
<p>The appearance of more foreigners is just one aspect of Tokyo’s gradually
become more like the rest of the world.  On much of the public transit, the
announcements and electronic displays are bilingual (Japanese/English) now.
There are concessions for the disabled; ramps and elevators and toilets
and so on.</p>
<img src="IMGP5922.jpg" alt="Busker near Shibuya" />
<p>Finally, and my second-favorite new thing about Japan, is the decline in
public smoke.  In lots of parks and restaurants and bars now, 
you just don’t smell much smoke.
Non-smoking seems to feed on non-smoking, based on the
experience in North America, so I wouldn’t be surprised if this snowballs.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Women</h2>
<p>The biggest change, to my eyes, is the way the women look and walk and
talk.
When I started going to Tokyo all those years ago, I was on a business commute
that took me back and forth between there and Hong Kong.  It was painfully
obvious; the Hong Kong women were glamorous and strong and
aggressive and sexy, in Tokyo they were mousy and dowdy and girlish and
boring.  Dress came in three flavors: schoolgirl, housewife-bland, and
office-bland.  Almost every woman I saw was an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_lady">OL</a>.</p>
<p>I don’t know what’s happened, but the Tokyo street-scene has become as
style-intense and full of eye-candy for the hetero male as anywhere.
I saw some astounding fashion statements, here are a few that stuck in my
mind: denim layered on brocade layered on 
filmy taffeta or something; long black vertical tunic with amazing crimson
slashes; fluffy hot-pink sleeves emerging from a green camouflage vest.</p>
<p>None of this would work if the women weren’t walking boldly, smiling
broadly from time to time, and generally looking strong and sure, which I saw
a lot of too.
Some were going for whimsy, some were were going for grace, some were going
for raw sex, and a lot of them had their looks working just right.</p>
<p>The men were less successful; some were making an effort too,
but without creative flair, doing Beatnik or Hipster or Rocker or Armani
pretty well straight up, not much <em>individual</em> style.</p>
<p>The women are mostly absent from the geek culture I was in, but that’s a
problem in lots of places.
Japanese culture has long been brutally
chauvinist towards women; I hadn’t heard that
life is getting better for them, but based on what I see just walking around,
I wouldn’t be surprised; you can’t really look good unless you feel
good.</p>

<title>mod_atom</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is a stripped-down implementation of the server side of the
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/wg/atompub/">Atom Publishing Protocol</a>
as an Apache module, implemented in C.  It felt like something that needed to
exist and I am better-qualified for this particular chore than your average
geek; having said that, I have no idea if anyone actually <em>needs</em> such
a thing.  mod_atom activity can be tracked on this blog, for now,
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/mod_atom/">here</a>.
If any interest develops, then I’ll transfer discussion
to a blog at <code>mod-atom.net</code> which will be driven, of
course, by mod_atom.</p>
<p>For the moment, I’m going to brain-dump everything about the project right
here, if only as a crutch for my own memory.  People who care
about the Atom protocol, and those who care about Apache internals wrangling,
might find it interesting; the intersection of those two groups is, I suspect,
me.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>What’s an Apache Module?</h2>
<p>It’s code that gets linked into httpd, the Web server binary.
There are
<a href="http://modules.apache.org/">hundreds</a>; a few are
included with the server distro, but most aren’t.
Code in a module doesn’t have to do anything like CGI, you’re just a C
subroutine that gets called with a package of details about the request and
the current server state. Which can save some cycles. Might those cycles be
significant in your application?  Maybe, sometimes. If mod_atom is fast, it’s
more apt to be fast because of its low-rent flat-file-only approach.
On the other hand, being
in the server means that you have to code in C and you have to be 
really careful about concurrency and memory management and all sorts of 
low-level grunge.</p>
<p>By the way, to be technically correct, whenever I say Apache I should
probably be saying “httpd”, since while they used to be synonyms, Apache means
<a href="http://www.apache.org/">much more</a> now, the 
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">httpd Web Server</a> is just one piece.
But httpd is an ugly little splodge of letters, Apache sounds so much
better.  And on modern Debian-family systems, httpd is called “apache” anyhow.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Why Me?</h2>
<p>Well, I understand the Atom Protocol pretty well and I’ve already
written a couple of Apache modules (for a failed startup), so it’s less work
for me than it would be for nearly anyone else.</p>
<p>Also, I think that the protocol is going to be a big enough part of the Web
ecosystem that Apache, as perhaps the world’s single most important piece of
Web infrastructure, really ought to support it.  Think of it as giving
PUT something useful to do.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>What Does it Do?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Implements all of the Atom Protocol, near as I can tell.</p></li>
<li><p>There’s no database.  Everything is persisted in files.
Entry paths look like <code>/blogs/tim/atom/e/entries/2007/06/23/cat-pix</code>
</p></li>
<li><p>Since it blasts Atom Entries straight into files, it can easily (unlike
most Atom protocol implementations) preserve foreign markup.</p></li>
<li><p>It should run fine under any MPM, without concurrency issues.</p></li>
<li><p>All the <code>atom:id</code> values begin <code>urn:uuid</code>, so you
could in principle move a whole publication from one server and directory to
another.  Those who have memories of me arguing bitterly against URNs in
general and <code>atom:id</code> in particular can please restrain your
snickering while I’m around.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-4'>Configuration</h2>
<p>There isn’t much. In your Apache config file, you can define as many
“publications” as you want.
Each requires one directive, for example:</p>
<pre><code>AtomPub /blogs/joe /z0/pubs/blogs/jb "Joe's Blog" "J. Blow"</code></pre>
<p>The first argument is a prefix; any URI beginning with it is considered to
be part of the publication.
The second is the filesystem directory where the data is rooted.  The
filenames are the same as the URIs, only with the directory substituted for
the prefix.  
The title and author are self-explanatory.  There are no defaults.</p>
<p>When Apache starts up, if there’s an AtomPub directive but the directory
structure isn’t there, the init code creates it.</p>
<p>mod_atom doesn’t do any other configuration of any kind, for the moment.  
Yes, I know there are lots of other kinds of configurations you might like to
be able to do.
People talk about hitting an 80/20 point; this more like a 60/1 point.
Publications have collections, and per RFC4287, the minimum you need is a
title and an author; so you really couldn’t do this with any less.
And with one line in a config file you get a fully-functional publication.</p>
<p>One thing you can’t configure at all is the directory layout where the data
goes.  That’s hard-wired way deep into the code.</p>
<p>Right now, a publication comes with two hard-wired collection named
“Entries” and “Media”.  The code can actually (in theory) handle multiple
Entry and Media collections, but I haven’t figured out a cheap enough way to
configure them.</p>
<p>After all, haven’t people been saying “Complexion over Commiseration” or
something like that recently?</p>  
<h2 id='p-5'>How Much Work Was It To Implement the Atom Protocol?</h2>
<p>Not much, actually, for a competent C programmer who understands
the protocol and some of Apache.  My Apache-module experience was less
valuable than I’d expected,
because I had written Apache 1.* modules and the 2.* API is quite a
bit different.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I started on April 26th and I have enough today to start showing
the world.  I program fast but I’ve been busy, so it’s a very part-time thing.
There are 8400 lines of code, but that includes a 2600 lines of of
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/02/20/GenxStatus">Genx</a> (because Apache
doesn’t have much of an XML generator) and then 2700 
or so of unit-test code (1700 or so being Genx’s).  So it’s really no big
deal.</p>
<p>Life was immensely easier because of having the Ape available.  
Being an Apache module imposes some constraints that make unit testing tricky.
While the Ape provides functional rather than unit testing, strictly speaking,
using it shook out loads of bugs and saved a huge amount of time.  The setup
was amusingly arcane; The Ape’s Ruby code running under JRuby in a servlet in a
Java EE app server talking to my naked hacked Apache server, 8080 to 4444 I
think.
What with some other things that are there to support 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span>, my little laptop is running more than its
share of Web servers.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Rocket Science?</h2>
<p>There’s really not much.  You suck in XML and bit-bags from the net, you
find a place to put ’em, you build feeds describing them, you echo them back
on request, you’re careful about concurrency.  It’s vanilla
infrastructure engineering.</p>
<p>There’s one premature optimization; I worried about someone setting up a
few thousand publications on one server (wouldn’t be surprising) and since the
way a module works is you have to look at every URI that comes in to see if
it’s one of yours, the task of scanning through your list of known pubs for
prefix matches could be pretty costly.  So, the
mod_atom setup code compiles the list of known pubs into a simple little
finite automaton which can tell you which if any of your pubs a URI belongs 
to really fast.
Which is pretty silly, YAGNI territory probably.  But I’m a sucker for finite
automata.</p>
<p>I tried to avoid mutexing; the only place where you really have to (I
think) is when a PUT comes in and you need to lock things down while you check
the ETag and, if you accept the PUT, blast it in.  I think you should be able
to get enough concurrency out of the filesystem for the rest of the
protocol.  Based on what I hear, if someone took a mod_atom install and
started firing PUTs at a few existing URIs from a lot of parallel sources, I
bet the <code>apr_global_mutex...</code> calls would start to hurt pretty
quick.  I have lots more premature-optimization ideas for that situation.</p>
<p>Frankly, the hardest bit was figuring out all the <i>autoconf</i> and
<i>libtool</i>
voodoo to compile the sucker, and in the end I couldn’t; in the finest
open-source tradition I reused
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/modskeleton/">code from Josh Rotenberg</a>
and did cut/paste/hack till it worked.</p>
<p>I’m assuming that one of these days someone I respect will explain to me
why libtool &amp; friends are a good idea and how to use them properly; until
then I’m going to ignore them and hope they’re replaced.  This technique allowed
me to avoid ever learning either imake or C++.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>Legal Status</h2>
<p>Apache V2 license, copyright Sun Microsystems, if the ASF ever got
interested I have the go-ahead to sign over whatever to whomever.
Haven’t figured out where to host yet, but 
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/code/mod_atom.tgz">here’s a tarball</a>.
If you want to actually try to run it, do please contact me.</p>
<h2 id='p-8'>Technical Status</h2>
<p>It’s not really ready to use, but I’m publishing it because I want to start
talking and get some advice and opinions on what I should do about some
things, and that’s easier if you can point at source code.</p>
<p>mod_atom passes a few (eighty-odd) unit tests, plus it gets a clean bill of
health from the Ape.  One of my short-term to-dos is to run Joe Gregorio’s test
client against it.
I’m pretty sure the basic technical approach to wrangling entries and feeds is
sensible and can probably be made to run very efficiently.</p>
<p>It has one big and one small missing piece, and a major enhancement I think
would be good.
The big missing piece is HTML (see next section). 
The small missing piece is collection paging; it just isn’t there at the
moment; you get the last 20 entries in reverse <code>app:edited</code> order
and that’s all you get.  No biggie.</p>
<p>The big enhancement I want to do is non-destructive editing.  Right now it
implements PUT by replacing the old data with the new, and DELETE by,
well, deleting the data.  I think it would be better, in all cases, to copy
the data aside, uh, somewhere.  But I want to talk to people about this one
too, because I suspect it may involve weird corners.</p>
<h2 id='p-13'>To HTML or not to HTML?</h2>
<p>For the moment, mod_atom is just an Atom server, not a blog engine.
Which is to say that it accepts and stores and updates and
deletes the Atom Entries and generates feeds appropriately, but doesn’t
actually generate any HTML versions.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what to do about this.  It’d be pretty easy to just pull the
data out of the Atom Entries, wrap some basic HTML around it, and have a
blogging engine.  But I think it’s irresponsible to publish HTML from outside
without sanitizing it.  While I’m betting that it’s appropriate to do the
low-level persistence and CRUD in the bowels of httpd, I’m having trouble
believing that HTML sanitation and beautification belong in there too.
There are tools like TagSoup and Hpricot which are just the thing for the
job.</p>
<p>So maybe there is an ancillary “blogging system” that does the necessary
with the Atom entries?
Or maybe there’s a TagSoup equivalent available for C that could help out?</p>
<h2 id='p-10'>To-Do</h2>
<p>Suggestions welcome.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Try it out on a few other systems, right now I’ve only tested OS
X.  I expect breakage in my hacked-up build system, but not much in the actual
code.  Programs written in C are portable, everyone knows that.</p></li>
<li><p>Shake it down with Joe Gregorio’s
<a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/apptestclient/">APP Test Client</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a bunch more tests to the Ape for bits of the protocol which, now
having implemented them, I realize are tricky.
In particular, the Ape never tested sending a PUT to a media resource, so that
portion of the mod_atom code is unexercised and likely buggy.</p></li>
<li><p>Add collection paging.</p></li>
<li><p>See if anyone at ASF might be interested, now or down the
road.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix up error handling so that client errors get an explanation in the
response body, not just an HTTP error code.  Apache doesn’t make this as
straightforward as you might expect.</p></li>
<li><p>Simultaneously, refactor error-handling internally.  Some of my
routines return
<code>apr_status_t</code> and others <code>char *</code>;
it’s kind of ad-hoc and not very well thought
through.</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out how to do some load testing.</p></li>
<li><p>Do some evangelism.  My eyes have that a Ruby gleam these days, and
grinding out all this C has been kind of painful so it would be nice if it
turned out to be useful for somebody.</p></li>

<title>Ape Rev</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I just posted a rev for the Ape 
(<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ape/">runnable</a>,
<a href="https://ape.dev.java.net/">source</a>), as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It uses the now-official APP namespace
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/app">http://www.w3.org/2007/app</a>.  <s>Since
none of the Atom servers out there that I know now have made this rev yet, the
Ape won’t work with anything.  Get with the program, guys.</s> <i>[There are a
few now.]</i></p></li>
<li><p>I added a test where I fire in a few posts, verify the
<code>app:edited</code> ordering, then hit one of them with a PUT and see if
the collection got re-ordered.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, to make sure the timestamps are distinct, there are now a
couple of <code>sleep</code> calls, so the Ape runs slower.</p></li>
<li><p>I added a test that when you delete a media link entry, the
corresponding media resource goes away too.</p></li>
<li><p><i>[A couple of days later.]</i>  Oops, turns out I’d entirely missed the
<code>&lt;app:accept></code> changes from the protocol-15 draft, but they’re
in there now.</p></li>
<li><p><i>[Friday]</i> Better error messages when the Ape can’t connect to
a host, a situation caused by a (common) error scenario where you screw up the
<code>href</code> value in a link.</p></li>
<li><p><i>[07/10]</i> Lots more tests to check that when you PUT, 
to a Media Resource, the MLE gets updated and the media collection gets
reordered properly. </p></li>
<li><p><i>[07/25]</i> Added a test where I post an entry full of evil 
markup—<code>script</code> elements, funky attributes, <code>javascript:</code>
links and so on—and see how well the server does at sanitizing it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are more items on the to-do list: Dave Johnson
<a href="http://rollerweblogger.org/roller/entry/atom_protocol_exerciser_ape_setup">had some grief</a> getting Ape to run locally.
Among other basic goofs, there’s currently no <code>README</code>.
Sigh, and sorry Dave.</p>

<title>mod_atom Status</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>People who are interested in the software shouldn’t have to read the acres
of prose in the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/06/25/mod_atom">mod_atom intro</a>, so I’ll
just keep this one up to date.</p>
<p>The code is currently
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/mod-atom/">here</a>.</p> 
<h2 id='p-1'>2007/06/27</h2>
<p>Updated iterator.c to fix
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/06/25/mod_atom#c1182924877.467244">pkeane’s
bug</a> while retaining concurrency safety.</p>
<p>Tested on a vanilla Debian box, and the compiler there emitted a
couple of warnings one of which turned out to be an actual bug (that the unit
tests hadn’t caught, sigh).  Whatever, it ran fine.
Like I said,
programs written in the C language are portable.  Write Once Run Anywhere,
baby.  Well, with
<a href="http://apr.apache.org/">APR</a> anyhow.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>2007/06/29</h2>
<p>Collection paging now seems to work (but only with “next” links).
(BTW, did you know you can’t subtract one <code>apr_time_t</code> from another
and expect to return the result in a <code>qsort</code> comparator?  I wanna
go back to Ruby.)</p>
<p>The README file is no longer just a copy of Josh Rotenberg’s.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>2007/07/10</h2>
<p>Ouf, what a struggle.  The last piece, supporting PUT on a Media Resource,
and consequently updating its Media Link Entry and making sure that collection
got sorted, chewed up all my time during the Berlin week when I wasn’t
child-minding or wedding-going or drinking beer.  Also, I had to add a bunch
of tests to the Ape to cover this function.</p>
<p>On the downside, the routine that generates the XML for a Collection feed
now has eleven (!) arguments, and thus screams out for refactoring.</p>
<p>On the upside, a lot of mod_atom’s work consists of pulling apart and
gluing together directory paths for entries, collections, and so on.  There
are a lot of ways to get the slashes wrong, so I had lots of bugs where paths
had two adjacent slashes, or worse, none.  So I wrote a nice little
<code>join</code> routine that glues segments together with only one slash
regardless of how sloppy you are passing them in; this allowed simplifications
here and there all over the place and is a lot more robust.  
Of course, wiring it in made many unit
tests fail, and then lots of Ape tests too, but this is what tests are for,
right?</p>
<p>I think I’m going to park the mod_atom code at Google Code or somewhere for
the moment and call this release 0.7.  The idea is that 0.8 will add HTML
generation and 0.9 non-destructive editing.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>2007/07/11</h2>
<p>It’s parked, for the moment anyhow, at
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/mod-atom/">Google Code</a>.  I had a little
trouble because on OS X, the svn you get from Fink doesn’t seem to have ssl.
That’s OK, it turns out Collabnet has
<a href="http://downloads.open.collab.net/binaries.html">up-to-date OS X
binaries</a>.  Thanks to Greg Stein for the pointer; he also noted that I
might want to switch mod_atom to use a few simple directives inside an
httpd-config <code>&lt;Location></code> block, then I wouldn’t have to do my own
prefix mapping.  I’ll have to think about that one a bit; sure sounds
plausible.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>2007/07/25</h2>
<p>I started working on sanitization code.  There’s the beginnings of a
discussion on the issues over on the googlecode
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/mod-atom/w/list">Wiki</a>.
For now, I only try to sanitize text constructs with
<code>type="xhtml"</code>, with a whitelist-based design (and whitelists, too) 
stolen from the
<a href="http://www.feedparser.org/docs/html-sanitization.html">Universal Feed
Parser</a>.</p>
<p>That code’s checked in, and there are tests for it in the Ape.
I still haven’t figured out what to do about <code>type="html"</code>.</p>

<body>
<p>I travel more than I’d like, so I just invested $80 and a couple of hours
of my time in getting a
<a href="http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel/nexus/menu-e.html">Nexus</a> card.
Actually, it’s only maybe a quarter of the time that I roll up to either the
US or Canadian immigration and face the dreaded long-lineup scenario; but
those times are painful.
<i>[Update: Jeepers, it’s getting hot in the comments; check it out.]</i></p>
<p>I have to say that the process was painless, polite, and reasonably
efficient.  You talk to the Canadian side, they take pictures of your irises
and give you a lecture on how it works, then you go the US side, they take
pictures and fingerprints and give you a card.</p>
<p>Or it would have been efficient, except for the couple in front of me in
line.  It turned out she’d lived in the States and had a Green Card in the
Seventies, and that set off all sorts of alarm bells, and they wouldn’t do
anything for her till she brought the card in and formally renounced it.
Then, it seemed that he had a (minor, low-grade) criminal record, which
occasioned further lengthy dialogue and delays.</p>
<p>By the time I got to talk to the official, he was kind of frazzled I think,
and never got around to asking whether I’d been arrested or turned away
from the US or done anything else nefarious.</p>
<p>As I went through the latter stages I listened to the dialogue with the
next couple, who were both realtors from the West Side of Vancouver; they
needed the card because they’d just bought a bigger yacht and wanted to dock
it down in Washington State somewhere.  Maybe I’m in the wrong business.</p>
<p>Now that I have the card, I’m officially “low risk”.  I better watch it in
the 
dodgier parts of the world, or someone may knock me over and steal my eyeballs
in a foul plot to wreak devastation on the West.</p>

<p>Let’s start with Python.  First of all, Guido’s lengthy

Status Update (Long!)</a>.  A little bird tells me they’re going to use UTF-16

fool.  Also from Pythonia:
<a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2007/jun/26/djangostatusupdate/">Django status update: June 26</a>.
Just because the world is breathing all heavy over Ruby these days doesn’t
mean Python’s less interesting.  If Ruby vanished tomorrow I
could transfer my world to Python with fairly little pain.  And my code
would run faster too.</p>
<p>Moving on to Atom, Trey Drake has more on his project:

To be brutally honest, most of the Atompub crowd is clueless about

<p>The other day we had tea in the garden lovingly tended by Rosemary and
<a href="http://alexwaterhousehayward.com/">Alex Waterhouse-Hayward</a>,
and I took pictures.</p>
<p>This is presumption verging on hubris, because Alex and Rosemary have
combined an obvious natural gift for the thing with fifteen years of hard
work; the garden is exquisite.  And since Alex is my personal favorite
photographer, my snapping at his work may well cross two separate lines.  But
I got a couple I like looking at and maybe you will too.</p>

<p>Check out

the first of Rob Scoble’s <cite>Fast Company</cite> columns.  It’s a nice

sentence in the conclusion:
<i>If your competitor builds a more interactive site than yours, customers
will flee to the “flashier” foe.</i>  Uh... Google?  eBay?  Amazon? Facebook?
All plenty interactive, and pure non-proprietary native Web technology.
The evidence seems clear to me: quality content and useful functions

<title>On Birthdays</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>That’s what this weekend’s all about.  Yesterday was
<a href="http://penmachine.com/">Derek Miller’s</a> and there was a
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/penmachine/sets/72157600580853178">cool
party</a>.  Today is my son’s and also Canada’s.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Practical Implications of Mortality</h2>
<p>The rhythm of birthdays propels us giddily up out of childhood (what joy,
to be heading into third grade) and then down the slope to whatever’s at its
end. As we drove down to Derek’s place in Burnaby we were listening to
<a href="http://www.theraconteurs.com/">The Raconteurs’</a> <cite>Broken Boy
Soldiers</cite>; with the boy singing along to <cite>Steady, As She
Goes</cite> from the back, I was smiling.  The good parts of the record sound
unnervingly like the Beatles.</p> 
<p>Which reminded me of a problem: I’m over fifty and my doctor’s about the
same age, and my lawyer and accountant are older.  Pretty soon, I need
to find new ones who are a couple of decades younger and can keep lawyering and
doctoring me and so on until I don’t need them any more.</p>
<p>In the Rock and Roll department, though, I’m OK; Jack White was born in 1975
and will likely be doing interesting things until such time as
I lose my hearing entirely.  But I do need to find a young novelist or two.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>For God and Country</h2>
<p>That’s what the motto used to be.  But while my son’s birthday, and
Derek’s, both move me, I find, year by year, my revulsion at the news of the
world is overwhelming whatever warm feeling I may have retained for
“Canada”, either as a concept or a reality.</p>
<img src="IMGP5979.jpg" alt="Derek Miller at his 38th birthday party" />
<div class="caption"><p>Derek Miller.  A little blurry; life’s like that.</p></div>
<p>Politics are necessary; we need to organize to build
roads and heal the sick and defend ourselves. 
Nations are too, because the planet is too big and
complicated for a Universal World Government.
But why on earth should we <em>love</em> them?  Loving is for people and
animals and places and works of art and craft, and I guess God if you have the
habit of belief.</p>
<p>Some Canadians practice <i>schadenfreude</i>-based nationalism, glancing
with smug revulsion across our southern border.  That’s silly; while Canadian
politics is transiently less awful then America’s current infestation
of revolting Republican brain maggots, it doesn’t make the nation worthy of
emotional involvement.</p>
<p>The neighbors across the back alley are having a Canada Day barbecue, with
a big flag and tasty smells and laughing; which isn’t a bad thing... at least
the nation gives us an occasion to party.</p>
<p>Still, I think the world would be a better place if people mostly didn’t love
their country and didn’t believe in God:  <i>No Hell beneath us/above us only
sky</i>.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Tribes</h2>
<p>Whether or not it’s reasonable to feel emotional about your tribe, it’s
wired in too deeply to fight.  And that’s OK I suppose.  My tribe,
ancestrally, were hardscrabble farmers and raiders from Europe’s northern
fringes, who sang joyfully of the smell of the enemies’ tents
burning and the sound of their women wailing.  I’ve been to the places they
came from and wouldn’t want to live there.
Samuel Huntington comes to mind: “The West won the world not by the superiority of its ideas or values or religion but rather by its superiority in applying organized violence. Westerners often forget this fact, non-Westerners never do.”</p>
<p>My current tribe is a complicated Pacific-rim multi-ethnic obsessive-geeky
thing, there in force at Derek’s bash, and I love it uncomplicatedly.  But we
don’t need a flag or an anthem or a Head of State.  It might not be bad if we
had ourselves a Tribal Day though, for a barbecue.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Happy Birthday!</h2>
<p>To Derek and the boy, at least.  And many happy returns.</p>

<title>The Number of the Rose</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The title refers obviously to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_of_the_Rose">Umberto Eco work</a>
which anyone who cares about 
knowledge and its preservation ought to read if only for fun; but the picture
refers only to itself.  With exegesis from Larry Wall.
<i>[Oh, my; give this audience a chance to indulge in linguistic pedantry and,
well, you don’t have to ask twice.  If you like this kind of stuff, don’t miss
the comments.]</i></p>
<p><i>[My first published draft credited Calvino instead of Eco for the book,
which explains the first comment below.]</i></p>
<img src="IMGP6002.jpg" alt="The Number of the Rose" />
<p>The number in this case is part of our address; the previous owner of our
house 
left some massive pieces of driftwood behind; I erected one in our front yard,
bolted the number to it, and have been trying to encourage this nice old white
rose to to grow for a few years now.</p>
<p>The resulting edifice is not unlike a standing stone, only it’s wood.
I wondered what to call it.  
The only professionally-trained linguists whom I know on a first-name basis
are 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall">Larry Wall</a> and his wife
Gloria, so I wrote them wondering if there were an
existing word for megalith-only-wood and if not, what one might reasonably
invent.  I seem to have lost the email I sent, but I have Larry’s reply, which I
reproduce from a 2001 email exchange without permission but probably with his
approval:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tim Bray writes:<br/>
: I live in hope of being able to coin a word and get into<br/>
: a reputable lexicon anywhere... would anyone chez Wall<br/>
: care to venture a suggestion?  -Tim</p>
<p>Well, wood/tree in Greek is xulon (where x is a xi, not a chi—see
xylem for a related word).  Unfortunately, mega-xul (or mega-xyl) is hard
to get your mouth around even when you're used to pronouncing “ks”
consonant clusters at the beginnings of syllables.  The only way to
pronounce it as an English speaker is to put the stress on the middle
syllable, and then you lose the accessibility of the “mega” morpheme.</p>
<p>You may need to abandon Greek.  Glo suggests mega-flotsam or some such.
Flotsam is from Old French, so maybe they have something that would
stand in for mega.  I'm not fluent in Old French.  I'm not fluent in
any kind of French, except maybe for English.</p>
<p>In German, anything you coin would probably start out gross-, which is
pretty gross.  But you get things like gross-holz, “big wood”, or
gross-treib-holz, “big driftwood”, or gross-zweig, “large twig”.</p>
<p>From Japanese we can coin words like okii-kare-ki, “big dead wood” (if you
go with native Japanese syllables) or dai-boku, “big wood”, if you go
with borrowed Chinese syllables, which make up at least half of Japanese
these days, much like half of English used to be French.</p>
<p>If you go for more humor, “big stick” would be dai-bookire, but getting
English speakers to pronounce the long “o” and the final "e" right
would be a trick.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, “big driftwood” in Japanese would be dai-hyooryuu-boku,
which I can guarantee you is not going to catch on.</p>
<p>For it, that's now.</p>

<title>Avoid Heathrow At All Costs</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’ve been through Heathrow a couple of times this year now, and my patience
has snapped.  Anyone who cares about cost, comfort, convenience, or getting
there on time with their possessions, should start taking extreme measures to
avoid routing through Heathrow.  They’re trying hard, but they’re failing,
it’s just broken.
Find another way; even if it’s longer and more expensive, the chances are
still that you’ll arrive sooner having spent and suffered less.
Yes, it’s that bad.
<i>[The comments are boiling over, I’m not the only one who
feels 
this way; can something be done?]
[Later: Check the horrifying number
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/07/03/Avoid-Heathrow#c1183703202.39599">reported</a>
by Hanan Cohen.  I’m serious; I am totally going to find a way around
Heathrow.]
[Later, still: In the last week of July, Eric Pfanner of the
<cite>International Herald Tribune</cite> ran across this piece and called me
for an interview;
<a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/08/01/news/transport.php">the
story</a> 
turns out to be about transport privatization in general, and is a good one I
think.]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Facts of the Matter</h2>
<p>Here are some things that differentiate Heathrow from good airports:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It’s insanely huge.  Making any transfer, or merely getting into
London, will require walking through endless dingy charmless hallways, dealing
with extreme crowding, and in most cases a packed, uncomfortable bus
ride.
I have learned that to make a connection involving a terminal change with any
reliability, you have to budget at least two (very unpleasant) hours.</p></li>
<li><p>They won’t gate-check strollers, so if you’ve got an infant or two,
you’re going to be carrying them down all those hallways by hand.</p></li>
<li><p>You will go through more security checkpoints.  In a (failed) attempt
to transfer from one British Airways flight to another, in the same terminal,
we went through <em>three</em> separate security checks, each with a lengthy,
cramped, line-up.</p></li>
<li><p>One carry-on only.  So if you’ve got a laptop bag and a purse, check
one.  Or if you’re just traveling for a couple nights and have your briefcase
and a soft-sider with the basics, you’re going to be waiting for luggage when
you get wherever you’re going.</p></li>
<li><p>If you’re hungry, there are exactly zero options which are good and
affordable.  If your budget is like normal people, you can join yet another
lengthy packed queue to get a generic Pret a Manger.  There are sit-down
restaurants, most serving indifferent food at obscene prices. Then there is
the champagne-and-smoked salmon bar, which is excellent, where one can eat for
the cost of five.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s too crowded; hard to find a quiet comfy place to sit down.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>On the trip from Vancouver to Berlin yesterday, we were two hours late
leaving Vancouver (reason unspecified, the plane was there), fought our way
through the airport to 
the Berlin departure gate while they were still loading only to hear “Sorry,
you’ve been de-boarded, go back to Flight Connections”.  Hours later, we made
it to Berlin via Cologne, but our luggage didn’t; it’s still not here. 
<i>[Update: The next day, it turns out that the luggage is still in London
and will be here (they promise) 9PM today; this is hard to understand when
it’s a two-hour-flight away.]</i>
<i>[And again: The luggage, misplaced Tuesday morning in London, did not
arrive in Berlin until Thursday afternoon.  Just avoid Heathrow.]</i></p>
<p>On the other hand: the people who work there, most of them, most of the
time, are really trying hard; professional, polite and reasonably efficient.
It’s just that what they’re trying to do can’t be done at the scale they’re
trying to do it.  Do yourself a favor and find another way to get there.</p>

<title>Pfifferlinge in Schmargendorf</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>What happened was, Geri who’s Lauren’s friend of many years, was getting
married 
in Berlin, so we spent a week there.  We stayed in the southwest, in
<a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin-Schmargendorf">Schmargendorf</a>, once an independent town, one of many swallowed up by Berlin in
1922.
Child-minding and wedding festivities and touristing and some mailing-list
work and fiddling with mod_atom and the Ape didn’t leave much time for this
space.</p>
<p>Lauren lived in Berlin for some years and it’s important to her, and she’s
very important to me, so for her sake I try to appreciate it, but it’s an
effort.  The best thing about it is the restaurant culture, which I’ll come
back to later.</p>
<p>As for the title:
<a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pfifferling">Pfifferlinge</a> are 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantharellus">chanterelles</a>, a fungus with a pretty
name in two languages, currently in season, they’re
8€/kg at the supermarket and all the restaurants are
featuring them.</p>
<p>Probably my biggest issue with Berlin is the visuals; it’s kind of
colour-starved and scruffy.  There’s green about, every boulevard and lots of
parks, both huge ones and little street-corner oases.  But they kind of let it
run wild, which jars my eye.  Here’s an example; we were at the
<a href="http://www.hotel-am-wilden-eber.de/">Hotel am Wilden
Eber</a>, the 
Wild Boar, so named because it was just down the street from the traffic
roundabout of the same name, with a statue in the middle.</p>
<img src="IMGP6045.jpg" alt="The wild boar statue in Platz am Wilden Eber, Berlin" />
<p>See the vegetation?  Pretty in its own way, but it makes me want to get out a
mower and some clippers.</p>
<p>The other thing that runs untended in Berlin is graffiti; it’s everywhere.  
And indeed, some of it is surprising in its flow and grace.  But Sturgeon’s law
applies: 95% of everything is crap.  On the other hand, the colour schemes in
Berlin architecture are basically cream, grey, and a few brick-and-stone
tones.  So the desire to splash some colour around is understandable.</p>

<img src="IMG_0430.jpg" alt="Berlin walls with graffiti" />
<img src="IMGP6158.jpg" alt="Berlin walls with graffiti" />
<p>Still, I’m glad we went: good people, good food, good beer, new flavors for
the mind.</p>

<title>Hamburger Art</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I like art galleries and museums, in particular modern art, something
that strains the brain a bit.  Berlin is a pretty big deal in the modern-art
world so when Lauren asked what <em>I</em> wanted to do one day, we
went to the
<a href="http://www.hamburgerbahnhof.de/">Hamburger Bahnhof</a>, at one time
the station where you got the 
train to Hamburg, now an Art museum, and old railway stations make good
ones.</p>
<p>Of course, most modern art is complete rubbish, just like most art was back
when da Vinci was working.  So when you invest a few hours, that’s a
high-risk investment.  The show at the Hamburger is entitled <i>Schmerz</i>
which to say “Pain”, and yeah, it was kind of painful.  Little of it spoke to
me; oh well.  Maybe next time.</p>
<p>Off in the side gallery they had a retrospective from Brice Marden, of whom
I’d never heard; his work
left me pretty cold, but the rooms and installation were nice.</p>
<img src="IMG_0363.jpg" alt="Brice Marden retrospective at the Hamburger Bahnhof" />
<p>The above were among the more dynamic works; a few of the big white rooms
were inhabited only by a few pale-brown or pale-grey rectangles.  I had to
feel sorry for the guards, one per room, who had to stand there all day.
There’s some <i>Schmerz</i> for ya.</p>
<p>Off the back of the main building, there was this narrow but immensely long
shed that had a bunch of exhibits under the theme <cite>There is never a
stop and never a finish</cite>.
Once again, few of them did
much for me, but the hallway down the side was oddly compelling.</p>
<img src="IMG_0364.jpg" alt="There is never a stop and never a finish, at the Hamburger Bahnhof" />
<p>Heh, after I started writing this I ran across a visit to the same
museum in
<a href="http://journal.davidbyrne.com/2007/06/62007-berlin-pa.html">David
Byrne’s Journal</a>; he even took a picture (the other way) down the same
hallway.</p>
<p>Here’s a view in the main hall of the former train station; I should go
track down who the artist is because the piece was pretty dramatic.
The room helps.</p>
<img src="IMG_0366.jpg" alt="Hamburger Bahnhof" />
<p>Off in another wing was what was maybe a permanent exhibition, with work
from an artist I’d actually heard of,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Beuys">Joseph Beuys</a>.  My fave
there was the medicinal cello.  Yes, I know there are reflections on the
glass, I like them.</p>
<img src="IMG_0367.jpg" alt="Red Cross Cello by Joseph Beuys" />
<p>I really recommend an occasional afternoon with the modern muse.  You may
find yourself wondering if the artists are mad, or you are, or the world is.
Which is a good thing to think about.</p>

<a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/%7Eseander/bithacks.html#RoundUpPowerOf2">Bit Twiddling Hacks</a>
by Sean Eron Anderson is pretty small, but those people will <em>really</em>
enjoy it.  I did.  The title is accurately descriptive.</p>
<p>I also enjoyed David Ing’s
<a href="http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=429b79ef-21ca-4523-be81-33b15fed7e5e">C# 3.0 Considered Rubenesque?</a>
It’s amusing and instructive, and of course much of it applies to modern-day
Java as well.</p>
<p>Somehow last month I missed Joab Jackson’s
<a href="http://www.gcn.com/blogs/tech/44512.html">Ruby’s easy but Java is
quicker</a>, which is surprising since the Java One paper was by Sun people. 
The data is interesting, but this is totally a moving target, with lots of
Ruby implementations being cooked up and Java not standing still either.  
I wonder if it would be a good idea to
take the Daly/Cooke model apps and have someone run them on a regular basis
every six months or so against the latest Java and Ruby builds?</p>
<p>Saving the best for the last: Elliotte Rusty Harold’s

<p>On the seventh of July this year, we participated in the global
lucky-number wedding boom by attending Gerhild and Reinhard’s wedding in Berlin.
Here are some photos, which are only of interest if you like weddings or
modern Lutheran ecclesiastical architecture.</p>
<p>It was a mainstream Lutheran church (they say “Evangelical” to distinguish
it from Catholic) in a nice neighborhood; kind of austere for my taste, but
nice enough, and with a first-rate organ.</p>
<img src="IMGP6068.jpg" alt="Gerhild and Reinhard’s wedding, 07/07/07" />
<p>When they stood to take their vows, the ring-bearer was Gerry’s daughter
Jana, holding one-year-old Joel, Gerry’s grandson; 
which I found moving.</p>
<p>Music was provided by a genuine gospel choir.  Their harmonies were
exquisite.</p>
<img src="IMGP6070.jpg" alt="Gospel choir at Gerhild and Reinhard’s wedding, 07/07/07" />
<p>Here’s a shot of the general chaos on the church steps after; about like
any wedding anywhere.</p>
<img src="IMGP6083.jpg" alt="Gerhild and Reinhard’s wedding, 07/07/07" />
<p>We had taken the bus to the service, but were offered a lift to the
reception.  I ended up sitting in the front of the main car, which is
probably the only time I’ll be in a Berlin bridal motorcade with 
twenty or so tin cans dragging behind; the sound is entirely unique.  You get
lots of smiles from strangers.</p>
<img src="IMGP6088.jpg" alt="Gerhild and Reinhard’s wedding, 07/07/07" />
<p>The reception was a blast; the kids charged all over and raised a ruckus,
and there was lots of food and wine, all good.
I had to take the baby home before the dancing started, but it was well into
08/07/07 before things wound down.</p>
<img src="IMGP6093.jpg" alt="Gerhild and Reinhard’s wedding reception, 07/07/07" />
<p>Best of luck to Gerry and Reinhard!</p>

<p><i>[Missed this one last week in Europe]</i> We made a big splash earlier
this summer at the High-Performance Computing show in Dresden; a concerted
attempt to grab a bigger piece of the HPC market.  I thought the coverage was
pretty intelligent: the big deal about
<a href="http://www.sun.com/featured-articles/2007-0626/feature/index.jsp?intcmp=hp2007jun26_constellation_read">Constellation</a>
isn’t the blades or the disks, it’s the big switch.  Anyone can stuff a bunch
of racks with blades with hot chips on ’em; the hard part is getting them to
work together, and whatever the approach, it’s easy to get bottlenecked on the
messaging.  The big new 3,456-way Infiniband switch is a brute-force assault
on the problem, combining silicon, bus-ware, connector, and cabling wizardry:

<title>Important: Microsoft Vancouver</title>
</head>
<body>
<p><i>[Missed this last week in Europe]</i>  Microsoft is
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2007/jul07/07-05MSExpandVancouverPR.mspx">opening an R&amp;D
shop here in Vancouver</a>, and they’re doing it specifically because of
immigration issues.  News Flash: Most of the really smart people in the world
aren’t Americans and don’t live in the U.S.  But if you want to gather a
bunch of them together to take on hard problems, you probably can’t do it in
America because of US immigration law.  Canada looks like a good
alternative: if you’ve got an established business willing you to hire you 
for a technology job at a decent salary, you can get a temporary-worker visa
here pretty well right away.  (Furthermore, if you like it and don’t commit any
major crimes, you can then arrange to stay and become a citizen.)</p>
<p>Canada’s a good place to build technology.  It’s a good place to live.
It’s an easy place to get into.  Microsoft isn’t stupid.  I think this is a
big deal. </p>

few.  He almost always says “Yes” and if you will indulge the fancies of an
indulgent Dad, I think he’s good.  Here’s his take on Berlin.</p>
<p>First, some architecture:</p>

<p>Next, the family; that’s Lauren’s friend Carola walking along with us.</p>

listen to one or two of the many live cuts of the Raconteurs’

<p>At this point, the pop-music-history-literate will insist on a bow in
the general direction of Led Zep and Big Brother and the Holding Company
for having invented the over-the-top demented-destructured electric-distortion

that it

<title>Schloss and Dom</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>In German, the first means
<a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schloss_%28Geb%C3%A4ude%29">castle</a>,
the second “dome” and often, by attribution,
<a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathedrale">cathedral</a>.
In the center of Berlin, one’s right beside what used to be the other.</p>
<p>Here’s some context:</p>
<img src="IMGP6166.jpg" alt="Schloss and Dom, Berlin" />
<p>The Schloss is in the foreground and the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berliner_Dom">Dom</a> behind.
In the old days, the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berliner_Stadtschloss">Schloss</a>
was the Kaiser’s nerve centre; in WWII it
took (like pretty well all of Berlin) severe bomb damage.  The DDR government,
which had little use for the Prussian monarchical heritage, deemed that it
couldn’t be repaired, and put up the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palast_der_Republik">Palast der
Republik</a>; Lauren tells me she visited it at least once, pre-1989.</p>
<p>It was found to have severe asbestos contamination and is currently being
taken down; “Dismantled, not demolished” say the billboards in German and
English too.  The process is visually dramatic.</p>
<img src="IMGP6174.jpg" alt="Demolition of the Palast der Republik in Berlin" />
<p>You can’t go inside it any more, but you can go into the Dom; you have to
pay, which rankles a bit.  I love ecclesiastical architecture, largely as a
consequence, I think, as a result of having been dragged through lots of it as
a kid because my parents did too.  So now I’m dragging mine.</p>
<p>Bazaars are good but cathedrals are nice too.  Hard to photograph from the
inside though, and capture a sense of scale.</p>

<title>Going for Beers in East Berlin</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Since I wasn’t personally close to any of the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/07/12/07-07-07">wedding party</a>, the big
day for me in our Berlin trip was the Sunday after; our one day of interrupted
sunshine, and we spent it all in beer gardens with attached playgrounds.  In
the morning, we had breakfast (no beer involved) with some of Lauren’s old
school buddies, and in the afternoon we had dinner and beers with some geeky 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> readers.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>East Berlin</h2>
<p>Nowadays, you could suppose this means the neighborhoods on the right side
of the map, but the ghosts of history linger.  For those of my age, it’s weird
and wonderful to be able to hop the S-Bahn to Prenzlauer Allee deep in the
heart of the former East Berlin, walk a couple of blocks, and sit down for
beers with geeks.</p> 
<p>But the two sides of the city still look different to my eye, here are a
couple of photos, West then East:</p>
<img src="IMGP6052.jpg" alt="West Berlin street-scape" />
<img src="IMG_0427.jpg" alt="An East Berlin street-scape" />
<p>Draw your own conclusions.  It’s the conventional wisdom that Berlin is
cheaper than the other big cities, and the former East has spots that are
cheaper still.</p>
<p>Mind you, that eastern neighborhood was not without its Olde European
charms; I don’t know what the “!” means:</p>
<img src="IMG_0429.jpg" alt="East Berlin neighborhood" />
<h2 id='p-2'>Geek Beers</h2>
<p>First of all, a major shout-out to
<a href="http://tomster.org/">Tomster</a> for organizing this.  
The geeks were nice and the location,
<a href="http://www.aloiss.de/aloiss/">Alois S</a>, charming if a bit grubby;
I totally recommend it if you’re on the East Side, hungry and with kids in
tow.</p>

economics of going online get better every year.  Thanks for coming out, guys.</p>

<title>Trains and People and Restaurants</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’ll close up this miniature series on Germany’s capital with observations
on getting around, the people who live there, and going out to eat.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, I’m not sure I’ll ever really warm up to the way 
Berlin looks; which is purely a matter of taste.</p>
<img src="IMG_0342.jpg" alt="Berlin house-fronts" />
<img src="IMGP6035.jpg" alt="Berlin architecture" />
<p>It’s a big city, pretty flat, and there are trains to take you everywhere.
Makes me think of one of the big Aussie cities, like Melbourne.</p>
<img src="IMG_0358.jpg" alt="Berlin subway trains, in yellow" />
<p>The most important thing about any city is the people who live there.
Lauren tells me she likes Berliners because they’re direct and thick-skinned.
To a less direct and thinner-skinned Canadian, this can come across as
appalling rudeness.  Example: Someone on a crowded bus rudely dumps his
knapsack on 
a valuable empty seat, then someone else comes along and snarls rudely at him to
take it off.  Closer to home: we were pushing the baby along in the stroller
on a warmish day, and she managed to pull one of her socks off, waving it like
a banner with glee.  It wasn’t cold and we didn’t want to stop to re-assemble
her, so we dropped it in the stroller carrier and went along.  Within the
first couple of minutes, a couple of total strangers had intervened to point
out that our baby had a bare foot and maybe this wasn’t a good thing.</p>
<p>At one level, I think I could learn to appreciate this; I care a lot about
living in a community with more involvement rather than less, and I value
transparency and honesty among all other things in communication.  It’d just
take some getting used to.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Eating Out</h2>
<p>There was one thing, maybe minor but significant, that I liked a whole lot;
I don’t know if it’s  a German thing or a Berlin thing.  Check out these two
eating establishments; one further west and a bit fancier.
Anything catch your eye about them?</p>
<img src="IMGP6128.jpg" alt="Nice outdoor restaurant in Berlin" />
<img src="IMGP6139.jpg" alt="Nice outdoor restaurant in Berlin" />
<p>In both of them, there are lots of children about.   Which is one aspect of
the way restaurants are more human and more pleasant places.  A beer garden
with a playground attached is a very fine thing on a sunny July day.  In
puritan North America, proposing such a thing would get you arrested, most
places.</p>
<p>Another symptom is that the waiters and staff are real people with real
jobs, not minimum-wage students punching menus on the computer system.  For
example, we were having lunch the day of the wedding and Lauren had to run off
to get her hair done and was getting short of time.  So she talked to the
waitress and the kitchen and it developed that her salmon-and-potatoes was
waiting for the potatoes, but they could dish it up right then if she didn’t
mind skipping them.  Another story: at that East Berlin place where we had
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/07/15/A-Beer-in-East-Berlin">beers with
geeks</a>, when we finally all headed out, the waiter came around, sat down at
the table, and laboriously worked out with all of us what each of us had had,
and made change individually.</p>
<p>Try to do do either of those at the chain restaurant in your local strip
mall.  Something’s broken and you don’t even notice until you go somewhere
that it’s not.</p>

<title>On PHP and Ruby</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Check out Matt Mullenweg’s
<a href="http://photomatt.net/2007/07/13/on-php/">On PHP</a>, which takes a
fairly caustic look at the (slow, stalled in many places) transition from PHP4
to PHP5.  The comments are interesting, too.  Sometime in the next couple of
years, there’s actually going to be a Ruby 2, and the Ruby and Rails
communities will decide, probably without much consideration for the Ruby
implementors’ feelings, whether or not to take the step.  There’s a fairly
widespread feeling that, as a piece of language design, the current Ruby
(1.8.6) is more or less Good Enough.  The Unicode handling needs
to be fixed, and the libraries need some work here and there, and I see
Charles Nutter
<a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/2007/07/to-keyword-or-not-to-keyword.html">proposing
plausible-sounding language changes</a> which would be invisible to 99% of
developers; but there’s no big community out there waiting hungrily for the
next Ruby.  A version that was a lot <em>faster</em> would be snapped up PDQ
you betcha, but few would care much about the version number.  So I think the
Ruby community as a whole would benefit from reading the conversation Matt
started, as we try to head into the Ruby 2.* future.
I personally think “runs faster and does Unicode right” will probably do the
trick, but let’s see.</p>

<p>I’ve only been on Facebook for a little while; I visit my turf there
once or twice a day when a friending request comes in (I wonder if/when

Sometime in recent days the “Reject” button went away, to be replaced by an
“Ignore” button.  Much less uncomfortable to click on, wouldn’t you say?
I wonder if the experience is less painful for the ignoree than the rejectee?
(I haven’t got around to propositioning anyone in weeks, so I don’t know).

<title>Prius</title>

<body>
<p>I was going to be driving up and down the Valley for the best part of four
days and Avis bollixed up my reso somehow so the usual mostly-harmless
mid-size wasn’t available.  “Wanna Blazer?” the redcoat said and I said
“Whatever”; F2F with the Blazer I was reminded it’s an SUV the size
of one of new high-density Vancouver townhouses.  I couldn’t face the thought
of hauling this ill-formed mass of steel up and down the California tarmac,
and as I was walking back to say “No” passed a row of Prii so I said
“Prius” instead and the guy said “You sure?  They’re weird, no key, can’t
figure ’em out myself.”  And you know, it’s not bad at all.</p>
<p>What with orbiting between Sun’s Menlo Park and Santa Clara offices and
once over the mountains to Half Moon Bay, I put a lot of miles on the little
goober and only burned half a tank.  There are irritants: the driver’s seat
needs a height adjustment and you could use a little more pep in some
perhaps not entirely necessary but nonetheless expedient freeway maneuvers.
But it’s nimble, turns well even at speed and is for most purposes entirely
adequate. 
And in slow stop-and-go it oozes along way quieter than most anything.  Plus,
you can drive in the HOV lane.</p>
<p>And somehow, I’m charmed by pulling into a parking spot, pushing the “Park”
button and the “On/Off” button.  Geeks just like buttons I guess.
Pity it’s such an ugly little sucker; I could totally see going for some sort
of upscale hybrid next time out.</p>

<title>Two From David</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’d like to encourage you to read two things featuring
<a href="http://www.evident.com/">David Weinberger</a>.  I’ve been meaning to
post about his new book for some time, but just recently ran across his
<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118460229729267677.html">“Web 2.0”
debate with Andrew Keen</a> over at the <cite>WSJ Online</cite>, and if you
care at all about this here Web thang, you really ought to go take it in.  Not
because it’ll educate and inform you (though it will) but because it’s good
fun.  I find the Net-centered life sufficiently fulfilling and self-supporting
that I wouldn’t take the time to react to a <i>provocateur</i> like Keen,
but it’s nice that David does so, while entertaining us.</p>
<p>Also, you should read David’s
<a href="http://www.everythingismiscellaneous.com/">Everything is
Miscellaneous</a>.  I finished it a couple weeks back and have been struggling
for a review angle.  You should see my copy, there are scribbled-on post-it
notes sticking out on average every three pages or so, and some of the notes
leak onto the page itself (Lauren objects to this and will be mad if she
notices).</p>
<p>The problem is that my roots and David’s are too close, we’ve both been
thinking about the same things in the same contexts for too many years, and so
if I wrote a <em>real</em> review it would be nearly book-length and address
his arguments at a level of detail that only an fellow-obsessive would
appreciate.</p>
<p>So, I give up. It’s on an important subject.  It’s beautifully written,
full of humorous and graceful turns of phrase.  It’s wrong about some things,
there are baffling omissions, and one or two horses flogged into dog-food.  But if you care about how one ought to
go about organizing information (and given the increasing volume and
centrality of the stuff, you ought to) go read <cite>Everything is
Miscellaneous</cite>.</p>

tidy package.  I kinda lost count of the Horcruxes, and the
extended-chase-scene middle dragged a bit, but still, well-done.  The last
couple of 
books obviously lack the fun factor of the first few, when Rowling was
inventing a world and its people and taking us along for the ride.  See ya,
Harry.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Probably Not a Spoiler</h2>
<p>I think the book is mistitled.  The Hallows are at best a side-show,
in fact dropping them would usefully have tightened things up.

<title>What XML Means</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>XML’s tenth birthday is coming up next spring; here’s my 
sound-bite on What It All Means.  XML is the first successful
instance of a data packaging system that is simultaneously
(human) language-independent and (computer) system-independent.  It’s the
existence proof that such a thing can be built and be useful.  Is it the best
choice for every application?  Is it the most efficient possible way to
package up data?  Is it the last packaging system we’ll ever need?  Silly
questions: no, no, and no.
<a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a> is already a better choice for packaging up
arrays and hashes and tuples.
<a href="http://relaxng.org/compact-tutorial-20030326.html">RNC</a> is a better choice for writing schema
languages.  A classic Unix-flavor file containing ordinary lines of ordinary
text is the best choice of all, whenever you can get away with it.  XML’s
still a decent option, probably the best, for interchanging things that are
(at least in part) meant

<p>Atom is 
<a href="http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf-announce/current/msg03937.html">done</a>.
Now the editorial processes grind away and eventually the official
specification of the Atom Publishing Protocol will be an RFC
substantially identical to
<a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/draft-ietf-atompub-protocol-17.html">draft-ietf-atompub-protocol-17</a>;
it’ll join RFC4287 as the official products of the
<a href="http://ietf.org/html.charters/atompub-charter.html">IETF Atompub
Working Group</a>.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>What’s Next?</h2>
<p>Now we’ll find out who’s interested.  The Atom feed format is a
success; RSS isn’t going away, but a steadily-increasing proportion of the
world’s new feeds are Atom 1.0.</p>
<p>I personally think the protocol’s going to be a big deal;
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/09/14/Why-Atom">here’s why</a>.
My track record as a prognosticator is good but not perfect.  There’s one
thing of which I’m confident though: if Atompub takes off, it’ll be in at
least one area that makes no sense at all to me, seems completely crazy.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Atom and Me</h2>
<p>I started getting interested in in Sam Ruby’s “Pie” project in 2003.  The
IETF process started in 2004.  So that’s four years of my life, more or less.</p>
<p>I don’t regret a moment of it.  I got to actually work, not just hang out,
with Sam and Joe Gregorio and, well, if I start listing names, this entry
will get out of control.  Except for Paul Hoffman, who combined IETF process
expertise with deft interpersonal skills, exercised not least in putting me on
a leash when I wanted to deal with blockages by applying extreme violence.
He’s become a friend, and you can’t have enough of those.</p>
<p>I should also say thanks to Sun for paying me while I spent part of my time
working on this.  Having said that, I think anything that makes the Net bigger
and easier and more useful is good for us because after all we sell the iron;
so I think it was a decent investment.</p>
<p>Plus, well, I think the Internet and the Web really need the Atom
protocol.</p>
<p>I’m kind of hoping, though, that I can take a vacation from standards work
for a while.</p>
<p>The IETF?  Well, it ain’t perfect, but work gets done.  It’s absolutely
intolerable, though, that the name of our spec co-editor
<a href="http://www.dehora.net/journal/">Bill de hÓra</a> will appear
mis-spelled on the RFC
because of the IETF’s bone-headed ignorant backward-looking bigoted ASCII-only
policy.  Speaking personally, it’s a problem I can’t just live with,
which means probably not much further work in the IETF.  Oh well.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>What Do We Call It?</h2>
<p>The term “Atom” is hopelessly vague, and most people use it to refer to the
feed format, which is fine.  We could say “Atom Protocol” or “APP” or
“Atompub”; let’s see what shakes out.</p>

<a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/article.php?story=20070723044713169">Update on the US Vote on OOXML (and What Happens Next)</a>.
He seems to have all the public facts, but speaking as one who’s been through
a few 
of those processes, I thought I should highlight something that’s going on
right now, but won’t be talked about much.  The problem of figuring out the US
vote is in the hands of the 16 members of the INCITS committee.  So
does that mean that everyone’s sitting still waiting for them to make up their
minds?  Nope.  What’s happening right now is that the big players with skin in
the game are applying executive-to-executive pressure, behind the scenes, to
the committee members’ bosses’ bosses’ bosses.  In a few cases it’ll work, and
the members will be issued here’s-your-vote marching orders.  I’ve seen it
happen.  In fact, when the intensity level gets up there, I’ve never seen it
<em>not</em> happen.  Nobody will ever know the whole story on what’s
happening right now under the covers.
I really don’t envy the committee members.</p>

report some cheery game news.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Two Ways of Looking at the Middle East</h2>
<p>Lord knows there’s enough coverage, but a few items still manage to
protrude from the torrent.  From the <cite>New York Times</cite> magazine,
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/08/magazine/08livni-t.html?ex=1341547200&amp;en=f8b4defd5b56201f&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss">Her
Jewish State</a> is an extended consideration of Tzipi Livni, currently
Israel’s foreign minister.  I’m sure I disagree with her on many things,
but it’s an eye-opening read.</p>
<p>On the other hand, speaking as a Canadian and without a trace of irony, I
was shocked and appalled by
<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/montreal/story/2007/07/23/qc-coulon0723.html?ref=rss">this
story</a>; apparently there are some opinions that are not allowed to be
expressed.  Even about negotiating tactics.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Art</h2>
<p>Specifically, Banksy’s.  I’d always been aware of him, seen one or two
amusing things, even read a big profile in the <cite>New Yorker</cite>, but
never really cared much, pro or con.  Then on the week-end I stumbled into
<a href="http://www.banksy.co.uk/indoors/index2.html">Banksy’s website</a>,
and ended up feasting my eyes for an hour.  Obviously there’s a
lot of wit and some pretty pointy sociopolitical gibes, but it was just the
grace of line and colour and shape that grabbed my eye.</p>
<p>Plus, there’s an actual live illustration of one of my favorite talking
points,

Room</a>.</p>
<p>Check out the
<a href="http://www.banksy.co.uk/shop/index.html">shop</a>, too.
Plus, I don’t see anything anywhere about copyright or restrictions or
anything, so I guess I can just reproduce them if I want?  Makes sense given
that most of them start as graffiti.  That’s what I call marketing.  So OK,
then:</p>

Road cycling, at one level it’s among the purest sports, or should be anyhow:
one human against mountains and clocks and other humans and his or her own
oxygen metabolism; strength and courage writ large.  Post-Landis, I’d resolved
not to care any more, but I woke up early one morning and accidentally caught a stage while
looking for something else, and started to care about Vinokurov and Rasmussen
and Contador and so on.  Like Renaud said, shut it down now; either they turn
it off or they’ve proved they just don’t care.  Yes, Contador too; as of
today, every professional cyclist is guilty until proved innocent.  In case
you hadn’t
noticed, the teams had to be carrying the transfusion and steroid-augmentation
equipment along with ’em; you can’t just drop by a village on the
Franco-Spanish border and pick up your next day’s red cells.  They’ve betrayed
millions; to hell with ’em.</p>

<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/archives/2007/07/19/off-to-oxford/">away
in Oxford</a> nine days, and the house unaccustomedly quiet.  The boy and I are
getting along OK in the eerie space and emptiness.  This afternoon, he asked
if he could go for a sleep-over at Samuel’s house, and I couldn’t see a reason
to say no.  When I packed him off with pajamas and a book and a “stuffie”
(what the kids call stuffed-animal toys these days) suddenly I realized that wow,
I was alone.  I could play the oddest music as loud as I
wanted.  I could have a wild party that ran till tomorrow.
I could practice my drumming.  I could, well... I dunno.  What I
really wanted was my family back.  Then in the late northern dusk, the phone
rang and it was Samuel’s mom: “We have a homesick boy here”.  So I went and
brought him home, and sympathized, and helped him get settled when he
couldn’t sleep.  And was glad to have him back under my roof.</p>

<title>On Drugs</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Gosh, there seem to be a lot of drugs in the news these days.
There’s a study out associating
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_issues_and_the_effects_of_cannabis#Effects_on_mental_health">cannabis and 
mental illness</a>.  Meanwhile, drugs destroyed the Tour de France, are
one of the main obstacles to peace in Afghanistan, and my home town of
Vancouver is itself an interesting little
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/10/Downtown%20Eastside">narcotics lab</a>
(for what it’s worth, I think the 2003 piece linked there is one of the best
things I ever wrote on this blog).</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Pot</h2>
<p>On that psychotic-disease study: Andrew Sullivan
<a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2007/07/the-pot-study.html">does
some numbers</a>, and one of his correspondents
<a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2007/07/a-reader-commen.html">raises
the obvious point</a> about correlation and causation.</p>
<p>In the original write-up of the study, some researcher is quoted as saying
“Experts are now agreed on the connection between cannabis and psychoses. What
we need now is for 14-year-olds to know it.”  Well, yeah, I was once a
teenager being cautioned about the dangers of marijuana, and I’m still kind of
mad at my parents’ generation: its officials and authorities told us,
time and again, that it led to heroin, that it caused all kinds of diseases,
that it was actually addictive.  “The really damning research is just
emerging” they kept saying.  In fact they were lying, and caused a whole
generation of people to disbelieve anything grown-ups said about drugs.</p>
<p>I smoked pot in the Seventies and enjoyed it.  If it were legal I might do
it again, except for probably not; I seem to recall it being extremely
time-consuming, and my time is pretty well spoken for.</p>
<p>Maybe when I’m a bit older; I saw
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">my Dad</a> get sucked into the
Alzheimer’s vortex, and that’s a bad, bad way to go.  I see that there’s
<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10330-hope-for-cannabisbased-drug-for-alzheimers.html">reason to think</a> that cannabis’ active ingredient might mitigate or delay
Alzheimer’s.  I was amused by this quote: “Wenk cautions, however, that
WIN-55212-2 still causes psychoactive effects similar to cannabis, and as such
is not yet a candidate for human use.”  Um, let’s see... the cost of pushing
back a brutal ugly slow path to death is getting high from time to time.  Yep,
I could make that sacrifice.</p>
<p>But still, when the subject comes up with my kids, I’m going to be brutally
honest, show them exactly where heroin and crack and meth lead—the facts
aren’t hard to come by, and you can see them walking down the street ten minutes’
drive from where I live.  On pot, they’ll hear from me about the bad side of
going outside the law even when the law is stupid, and how they ought to be
focusing on learning and figuring out what their life’s going to be.  But I’m
not going to tell them it’ll turn them into junkies or psychotics, because we
should have learned by now that lying doesn’t work.</p>
<p>And any thinking person can see that law-enforcement efforts against
cannabis have been a messy, expensive failure whose main accomplishment is
enriching a great many very bad people.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Drugs OK, Then?  No</h2>
<p>My basic point is the same one I was making in 2003: narcotics are
different enough from each other that any phrase involving the word “drug” is
probably dangerously misleading: “drug abuse”, “war on drugs”, and so on.
It’s the kind of thinking that leads to parents lying to teenagers.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the Tour de France, for example; recently
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/07/26/Stop">I wrote</a> that it should just
be bloody well shut down.  Check the comments to that piece; quite a few
people are saying “whatever, let ’em take what they want”.  That seems all wrong
to me; research has shown that these people will trade their health, their
life even, for winning this race this year.  We can’t let them do that, and
turning the competition into lab-vs-lab seems to miss the point in an obscene
kind of way.  If they can’t fix it, they should stop the race.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Afghanistan</h2>
<p>This is a tough one.  The guys we’re fighting over there are bad guys, the
worst kind of menacing medievalist morons; I have no qualms about trying to
wipe ’em out.  On the other hand the vast majority, just like everywhere, 
want to earn their living in peace, and the best way for them to do that is by
growing opium poppies.  If we try to stop them, maybe we drive them into the
arms of the other side; odd, that, since the Taleban, who did <em>not</em>
offer good government, did nonetheless temporarily shut down the opium biz.</p>
<p>There are lots of legal opiates, I’ve been thankful for them once or twice
in post-op mode myself.  But that’s not a solution, because it’s the fact that
heroin is illegal that makes the crop profitable.  I have no idea what to do.
On the face of it, heroin isn’t like pot and it’s hard to be comfortable
decriminalizing it.  But a reasonable person has to ask, given that all these
decades of law enforcement haven’t made much progress, and that the War on
Drugs is enriching all the wrong people, and the fact that while heroin is
bad, it’s nowhere near as bad as crack and meth and friends, whether our
current approach is really, at the end of the day, rational.</p>

<p>Here are two considerations of the fact that trying to get work done in
just one programming language is no more likely to be possible in the future
than it has been in the past: Neal Ford’s
<a href="http://memeagora.blogspot.com/2006/12/polyglot-programming.html">Polyglot
Programming</a> and Martin Fowler’s 
<a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/OneLanguage.html">Should we strive to
only have one language in our development efforts?</a>  Both are worth
reading, partly because they take up more general issues like concurrency and
the old static/dynamic debate.  But both conclude that yeah, no surprise, the
future is multilingual.  So how do we integrate ’em all?</p>
<p>Integration is a two-part problem, depending on whether the network is
involved.  In fact the network <em>is</em> the computer, but there are still
lots of cases where you need to get C++ and Java and Rails and whatever code
running on the same computer talking to each other.  This is one of the
reasons why projects like JRuby and IronPython and so on are interesting; if
you can call Language X’s APIs from Language Y, life is easier.</p>
<p>But often you can’t.  Even if you’re living on one computer right now, it
might be smart to write your integration pretending that you’re not, so that
when the load cranks up, you can scale out.
From where I sit, the only good answer is still something with a REST flavor,
where by “good” means “We know how, it’s tractable to build and maintain, we
can make it secure, the
performance is probably Good Enough, it’s not terribly sensitive to the
co-operating parties’ languages or databases or operating systems, and you can
run it on as many computers as you need to.”</p>
<p>Does anything else matter?</p>

<title>5★♫: Cinquième Saison</title>

<p>This one is kind of obscure, but worth hunting down; the full title is
<em>Si on avait besoin d’une cinquième saison</em>, recorded by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonium_%28band%29">Harmonium</a>
in 1975, who
were a Big Deal in Québec back then.  I’m sure it would appear in my personal
top-ten-of-all-time list, computed by how many times I’ve listened; mind
you, that’s with 32 years of accumulation.  But I still put it on, and I’ve
never played it for anyone who didn’t like it.
It’s mellow, sweeping, and full of beautiful melodies, beautifully performed,
that you’ll find yourself humming while you walk down the street.
<i>(“5★♫” series introduction <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music">here</a>;
with <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music#p-1">an
explanation</a> of why the title may look broken.)</i></p>
<img src="jc0002.jpg" alt="Harmonium: Si on avait besoin d’une cinquième saison" />
<h2 id='p-1'>The Context</h2>
<p>Back then, as now, Québec and Canadian music were entirely
different things; “Two Solitudes” is the Canadian way of describing this. 
But Harmonium was different, the music was so seductive that they broke out
and sold a lot of records among us Anglo honkey <i>têtes carrées</i>.  But I
never heard of a tour coming anywhere near me; I’d have gone in a flash.</p>
<p>I honestly can’t think of another band that bridged the solitudes in our
direction, and I don’t know about the other side.</p>
<p>Now, about the title.  As a reasonably-competent speaker of bad French,
I always come to grief trying to translate phrases that use <i>on</i>, because
it has a feel in my mind that just isn’t there in English.  The conventional
rule would give you <cite>If a fifth season were needed</cite> but that isn’t
even close.  If I had my back to the wall I’d suggest something
like <cite>Another season if you
need it</cite>; maybe someone who’s <em>really</em> bilingual will help out in
the comments.</p>
<p>The cultural context is definitely Seventies artsie druggie hippie; the
front and back covers, reproduced above and below, make the point.
You want bunnies, they got bunnies, every colour.  It might
help to understand that in Québec, seasons are a really big deal; winter is
brutal, spring is miraculous.</p>
<p>I didn’t run a picture of the band, because the ones I found featured 
guys who didn’t look that great, with bad Seventies hair.</p>
<img src="jc0006.jpg" alt="Harmonium: Si on avait besoin d’une cinquième saison" />
<h2 id='p-2'>The Music</h2>
<p>If you were going to use the language we used to use back then, you’d have
to mention Art-Rock (heavily-composed, elaborate arrangements) and Folk-Rock
(mostly acoustic instruments), but then they veer into Dixieland and big
orchestral sounds, and, well, it just doesn’t sound like anything else in my
vast collection.  But damn, it sounds good.</p>
<p>The first song, <cite>Vert</cite>, opens with doubled flutes that set a
mood; the rest of the record sustains it.  Nicely-played acoustic guitars and 
really tasty bass fill in, then the vocals, then the harmonies, then the
woodwind breaks, and you know, the music is so good that I’ve never been able
to bear down and figure out what it is they’re singing about.</p>
<p>I sat here and tried to write an analytical narrative about the songs as 
they went by, and tried to show how they evoke the seasons and challenge
conventional wisdom about the kind of instruments that can be used to play
Dixieland and Folk and Jazz, and the extremely tasty use of woodwinds that you
usually never hear on anything that’s Pop, and how the bass-line oozes in
behind, and how acoustic-guitar chords, recorded correctly, can sound bigger
than Mahler and Bruckner put together, but my narrative skills ran out.</p>
<p>Suffice it say that there are four songs purporting to represent seasons
(you have to guess which, they don’t say).  Then another, <em>Histoires Sans
Paroles</em>, for the fifth, and it’s about perfect.
I entirely lack words to describe it, which should be true of all the really
good music.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Sampling It</h2>
<p>You can buy it on Amazon which means probably lots of other places too, and since every track is good and the price isn’t
too steep and the sound is great, a shiny circular object is definitely called
for in this case.  Go buy one.</p>

<title>FY07: Disclosure</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’ve never before commented on Sun’s financials or share price,
so I should start off by emphasizing that I’m <em>not</em> a financial
insider, in theory or practice; I have
exactly zero advance knowledge on how any given quarter’s going.  I haven’t
worked at a big public company since the Eighties, so I don’t know whether
this is typical, but I’ve been impressed at the data control; there’s
certainly a rumor mill here but I’ve never heard a single whisper on financials.
Anyhow, this all means I can buy and sell shares whenever I want, and I have
been.</p> 
<p>Since I’ve been here, I’ve noticed a pattern where, as it gets close to the
end of each quarter, the share price drifts down; I guess there were enough
crappy quarters that this was a decent way to make money.  Lately, with
our CEO and CFO are running around making happy-face promises and not showing
any signs of backing off them, the pattern seems silly.  
As an employee and shareholder, I was pleased to see that people who did the
end-of-quarter dump thing last quarter probably lost some money.</p>
<p>So this last quarter, I’ve been picking up Sun shares on the market when
they get south of $5.  We’ll see how that bet works out. Just putting this on
the record so that those readers inclined to see me as
a corporate tool will have another reason to discount anything I say.</p>
<p>In fact, if you’re going to distrust me, it shouldn’t be because of the
logo on my paycheck or the capital-gains upside on Sun shares, it’s because
I’ve got my ego wound up in this now.  There are not that many successful
turnarounds that start from a position as crappy as things were here when I
joined the company in 2004; being a small part of one is a very big deal to
me.</p>

<title>Atomic Financial Publishing</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Well, the
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/truly_fair_disclosure">first-ever release</a> of a major public company’s financials via the
Web, in advance of the conventional newswire service, is history.  It went OK,
but we can do better.  Obviously, these discussions have been
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/02/20/Fair-Disclosure">going on for a
while</a>, and observant readers may have noticed I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/03/29/Zoe-Lofgren">visited Washington</a>
last March.  However, the go-ahead to do the numbers on the Web came very
recently, and so the mechanism was an ordinary RSS feed.  We should
publish this in Atom, and do it over a TLS channel, and supply a digital
signature.  Stand by for next quarter.</p>
<p>You’d be surprised how much work it is to set up for this kind of a
high-volume public Web event.  When I went to the sun.com people last week and
said “Oh, and you’ll be switching over to TLS and Atom in the three working
days left, right?” they laughed at me.  Today, I noticed that while the RSS
feed was updated spot on the top of the hour, it took a few minutes for the
actual earnings release to trickle through the various levels of cache.
There’s a first time for everything, that’ll get cleaned up.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Why TLS?</h2>
<p>For the non-geeks, this means that the feed URI will start with
<code>https:</code>, it’ll be a secure channel.  This just has to happen,
because otherwise there’s a potential gold mine for a smart bad guy.</p>
<p>What the smart bad guy does is figure out how to (temporarily, locally)
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_system#Security_issues">hack
the DNS</a>, say in a few key Manhattan offices, during trading hours.
He sets up a fake <code>sun.com</code> and puts a fake news release in the
feed claiming that we’re the subject of a major SEC investigation, having
first shorted a few million shares.  Ouch!</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Why Digital Signature?</h2>
<p>This idea was first proposed by
<a href="http://www.snellspace.com/wp/?p=713">James Snell</a>, and it’s a good
one.  Mind you, the benefits are a little bit theoretical, since no 
feed-reading clients that I’ve seen actually check a digital signature.
The argument for this is similar to that for TLS; a bad guy who could somehow
insert a fake press release into the feed could make zillions
by gaming the share price.  A verifiable digital signature would let someone
reading the feed know that the news in it really truly did come from Sun.</p>
<p>My hope is that if we and a few others start using signatures, the people
who write clients will start checking them.  This is the Internet, and we’re
playing with real money and shooting live ammunition; gotta be careful.</p>

<title>The Moon</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I was coming home from a late night out and the moon hung full, bright in the
windshield.  I’ve tried to photograph it so many times over the years and
generally failed.  Finally, a partial success, which I’ll indulge myself by
sharing with the Net.</p>
<img src="IMGP6346.jpg" alt="The Moon" />
<p>This is with the old pre-digital
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/05/07/Sports-Photog">Tamron 70-210mm
<i>f/3.5</i></a>, cranked to the max of course.  You might want to click to enlarge.</p>
<p>The problem is that the moon is a light-coloured fully-sunlit object, but
surrounded by so much blackness that your camera’s built-in light meter has a
really tough problem.  So what I did was set the ISO to 800, the
aperture to <i>f</i>/8, and shot at every speed between 1/60 and 1/1000.  This
is the last, a thousandth of a second, which means that I could have used a way
lower ISO setting.  Pale sunlit object, remember.</p>
<p>In the interest of honesty, I should say Lightroomed heavily.  I wonder
if that’ll become a verb like Photoshop has?  Feels awkward at the moment.</p>

<title>On Being for the Web</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This thread starts with Bill de hÓra’s excellent
<a href="http://www.dehora.net/journal/2007/07/earned_value.html">Design for
the web</a>, which has useful links and commentary about problems with Java
web frameworks.  Coté follows up with
<a href="http://www.redmonk.com/cote/2007/07/25/javas-fear-of-commitment/">Java’s Fear of Commitment</a>,
also very good, and interesting discourse breaks out in both parties’
comments.
Obviously, Bill and Coté are correct; embracing the Web is going to get you a
better result on the Web than not embracing the Web.  If you want more
evidence, look no further than PHP, a deeply-flawed tool whose success is
based on (admirably well-done) Web-centricity.  Normally, I’d leave it at
that, but Coté is wrong about Java and Bill is wrong about both ETags and MVC,
and I think all of those things are important enough to push back on.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>ETags</h2>
<p>Bill highlights the ETags support in Rails and Django as evidence in his
argument that embracing the Web is a good thing.  That’s true insofar as Rails
and Django at least recognize that ETags exist; but in fact the default
implementations are very nearly useless.</p>
<p>What do ETags do?  They allow you, when you fetch a Web
resource, to send a short string along with the request saying “this is the
signature you sent me for the version I know about”; then the server can look
and see if
the signature is still good, and if so not bother sending the data
redundantly.  Which is potentially a big, big win.</p>
<p>But also potentially not.  If you look at actual real-world servers that
are maxed out, they’re mostly maxing out on computation or back-end database
traffic, not on bandwidth to the Net.  So the saving that would be really
valuable would be if you didn’t have to rebuild the requested page.
Unfortunately, both Rails and Django rebuild the requested page, then compute
the signature, then check the ETag.  Which is extra run-time work in order to
conserve a resource (Web bandwidth) that probably isn’t the problem.</p>
<p>What you want to do is compute the ETag based on the underlying data
resources that actually drive the page creation; the <em>input</em> to that
process, not its output.  This is often going to be a small number (sometimes
one) of timestamp or version fields in a database row, or metadata from the
underlying filesystem.  It’s also going to be application-dependent.  So a
framework that 
was <em>really</em> designed for the Web would expose the ETag generation to
the application programmer in a way that let them be smart about conserving
the resources that actually matter.</p>
<p>For example, when the Apache webserver accesses a resource which is a
static file, the ETag is based on its inode number, size, and last-modified
time.  Which you get almost for free from the OS without even having to open
the file.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>MVC</h2>
<p>While I’m beating up on Bill (and once again, let me emphasize that his
central thesis is right-on), over in Coté’s comments he praises Django, saying
“it does 
not follow MVC. MVC is for desktop apps not web sites.”  Well, I hear gripes
about Rails, but they typically aren’t about its MVC-ness; in fact I mostly
hear warm-fuzzies about that, just because it’s a maintainability boost,
helping you find the code you need to hack to kill a bug or build a
feature.  So on this issue, I don’t think the evidence is with Bill.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Java</h2>
<p>Coté invests multiple sarcasm-laced paragraphs sneering at Java’s
insistence on making as much of the underlying infrastructure swappable as is
reasonable. Then he backs off and says “There are some things that it works
well for in Java — file systems, sorting algorithms, collections, and all
sorts ‘low level’ API things.”</p>
<p>Well, d’oh.  And in fact Ruby and Perl and Python and PHP let you swap out
pretty well all the same stuff. WORA isn’t just for Java any more, and WORA is
a very very good thing indeed.  Even the bloody C code I’m wrestling with for
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/06/27/mod_atom-status">mod_atom</a> already
runs fine on OS X and Linux and Solaris, and will probably be easy to get
going on Windows, because of
<a href="http://apr.apache.org/">Apache APR</a>; you know, swappable
infrastructure stuff.</p>
<p>The problem with those Java frameworks isn’t about swapping or abstraction,
it’s that their designers couldn’t bring themselves to embrace the Web as it
is.  BTW, check out the recent EE work and the
<a href="https://jersey.dev.java.net/">REST JSR</a> and
<a href="http://grails.codehaus.org/">Grails</a>.  The Java community has
noticed.</p>
<p>Anyhow, like I said, Coté and Bill both get the answer right and their
pieces are worth reading.  Which is why I think it worthwhile to point out
missteps along the path.</p>

<title>Photo Tab Sweep</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Lots of interesting discourse out there in the photogeek world, girls and
boys.  Here’s your lightning tour, this one dominated by 
Mike Johnston of
<a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/">The
Online Photographer</a>, currently about my favorite photoblogger; high
quality stuff and a nice light tone.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>DSLR Shopping?</h2>
<p>Mike’s old DSLR is running out of steam, 
so he
<a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2007/07/choosing-a-new-.html">asked his readers</a>, one of the best-qualified communities you could
possibly imagine, what to do.</p>
<p>There are 73 comments, very hands-on, no theoreticians.  If you’re thinking
about a DSLR you might learn something from them.  Even more valuable, I
think, are Mike’s thoughts on his own trade-offs and itches.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Good Little Camera</h2>
<p>I have bitched here previously about the lack of a high-end fits-in-your
pocket compact camera; see 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/02/25/High-End-Compact-Cameras">here</a>,
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/03/05/Cameras">here</a>,
and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/06/15/Cameras">here</a>.
It turns out that some of major photogeeks out there feel my pain, and have
gone so far as to specify the camera they’d like someone to build for
them. Check out
Mike Johnston’s (same guy, different site) 
<a href="http://www.llvj.com/columns/DMD.shtml">‘DMD’: The Digital Camera I’d Like to Own</a>
and Thom Hogan’s
<a href="http://www.bythom.com/compact.htm">Thom’s Compact Camera Challenge</a>.</p>
<p>Thought-provoking indeed.  I still think those Ricohs look good.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>No Zoom</h2>
<p>I’ve written here about my recent lens purchases, both from
the Pentax “DA Limited” series, the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/04/27/Pentax-P-DA-40mm">40mm</a>
and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/05/24/Pentax-SMC-DA-21mm">21mm</a>; they’ve
made me happy, to the extent that I haul the Pentax around to lots more places
than I used to.
They are both “prime” lenses; which is to say, no zoom.  I’ve said a few words
about my choice of an apparently-crippled device, but Mike’s
<a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/the-case-against-zooms.html">The Case Against Zooms</a>
goes wide and deep on the subject.  Watch out, reading this could be the first
step onto the slippery slope of lens-geekery.</p>
<p>Actually, I disagree with one of Mike’s key arguments: that a prime user is
agreeing to accept that lens’ point of view.  I publish almost nothing here
without some pretty heavy cropping, so for me, the lens POV is just a starting
point.</p>
<p>For example, I recently ran a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/07/26/July-Flowers">nasturtium picture</a>;
one of my commenters said it would have been better if I’d focused only on the
flower.  Well, maybe, but in fact here’s how I got the composition that I
actually ran, you be the judge.</p>
<img src="Nasturtium-crop.jpg" alt="Nasturtium photo crop in Adobe Lightroom" />
<p>That’s Adobe Lightroom’s wonderful crop-and-rotate tool at work.</p>
<p>For me, the primes are irresistible for two reasons.  First, they’re small
and light;
with the 21mm/40mm  pair, everything goes in one form-fitting bag, the extra
lens and the USB card reader fitting down in the bulge where the zoom used to
stick out.
Second, with one less control, I compose with my body and I shoot faster which
means a better chance at something decent.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>The M8 Again</h2>
<p>For the last couple of years, the number-one controversy in the digicam
world has surrounded the Leica M8, an insanely-expensive rangefinder closely
based on the classic M7.  DPReview, which I think is the world’s largest
digicam-review site, finally bit the bullet and 
<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/leicam8/">reviewed it</a>.
(I’ve
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/04/29/Tab-Sweep#p-2">touched on this
issue before</a> and pointed to a pair of Mike Johnston pieces on the M8.)

<title>Unprofessional in Black</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’m talking about my computer, which is a MacBook, not a MacBook Pro, and a
lovely flat black colour.  It’s by a long shot the best Mac I’ve ever had.  I
gather the Pro line is due for a refresh soon; it better be good, because at
this point anyone who buys a silver Mac is making a big mistake.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Battery!</h2>
<p>Whenever I was working with my silver macs, I was either plugged into AC,
or I was worriedly watching the battery meter.  No longer.  Unless I’m going to
be working for a major block of time, I just don’t bother plugging it in.  It
goes hours and hours, haven’t really measured how much, but enough that with
one spare battery, I really don’t care whether the airplane has laptop
power.</p>
<p>It’s a big deal.  The weather’s nice and I’m typing this on my back porch;
we’re having lasagna for dinner and it’s too hot for the oven, so the
lasagna’s on the barbecue and I’m on the back porch keeping an eye on it in
case it gets too hot.</p>
<p>Eventually, I’m going to sit down at my desk or on the comfy work chair at
home and sock in for a few hours; then I plug in, and it doesn’t take that
long to charge up.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>WiFi!</h2>
<p>Did I say I was on the back porch?  With the old silver Macs, that worked
if I was careful to sit right outside the open door.  With the Black Beauty, I
can go downstairs off the porch and sit on the grass in the shade of the pear
tree.  And see eleven other neighborhood WiFi networks too.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Tiny!</h2>
<p>It’s smaller.  I can actually get work done on airplanes, even when I can’t
upgrade.  This is a big deal.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Tough!</h2>
<p>So far, the black plastic body is holding up better than my one Titanium and
two Aluminium PowerBooks.  It’s easier to clean, too, I get good results with
plain old Windex.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>It’s Not Perfect</h2>
<p>The screen is only 800 pixels high, and that
hurts on the photo-editing front.  But hey, it drives the 24" widescreen just
fine, so that’s usually not a problem.</p>
<p>It lacks a video card and a FireWire800 and the video jack is nonstandard
so I have to carry one more dongle.  I’m stuck at 2 gig of RAM, can’t go to 3.
Except for, none of these things bother me.</p>
<p>And, um, it looks cool.</p>

<title>Vlad and the Mariners</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>What with the weather good and the family home, the TV’s been mostly dark;
but the other day I was too burnt-out to work, flipped it on and was
captured by the Mariners (kind of the local team here) vs.
the Angels.  So I had to go back the next night, and now I’m watching the
Mariners and the Red Sox.  And it’s been some remarkably pleasurable
baseball.</p>
<p>It’s awfully nice that Seattle’s playing better, maybe a contender.  If only
because of Ichiro, whose speed and grace are wholly beautiful;
but in recent years he’d been a diamond in a dustbin.</p>
<p>I’ve also admired the Angels lately, just because Vlad Guerrero is
so much fun to watch.  There were two moments in Wednesday’s game that I
thought were more or less perfect baseball.  First, Vlad challenging Ichiro to
gun him down at the plate.  It’s not surprising that Ichiro won, after all
it was a pretty short fly and he caught it coming in at speed.  What’s
surprising is that Guerrero made it close; on that play, Ichiro gets almost
any other player in the game by ten feet.</p>
<p>Second, later in the game: Guerrero at bat, takes this monster swing at a
nasty breaking ball.  It’d have been gone if he’d hit even 60% of it, but he
only got about 1% and it went rolling up to the third baseman, who was
(obviously) playing back.  Vlad laid on some serious hustle and crossed first
base safely, laughing.  That’s how the game ought to be
played.</p>
<p>Now I’m going to shut up and watch the Mariners and Sox, close in
the seventh.</p>

<p>Today we have Java yielding, thread ranting, REST lecturing, and identity
insight.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Yield!</h2>
<p>On the <cite>Chaotic Java</cite> weblog,
<a href="http://chaoticjava.com/posts/java-yield-return-code-published/">Java
“yield return” code published</a>.  Anyone who’s gotten comfy with Ruby’s
yield/block idiom quickly starts to wish that every language had it.  I
haven’t had the time yet to do a deep-dive on this, but that’s definitely on
the to-do list.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Threads ewwwwwwww</h2>
<p>Roman Shaposhnik has
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/rvs/entry/the_problem_with_threads">The problem
with threads</a>, a nice succinct explanation of why, from a programmer’s
point of view, they pretty well suck.  I freely admit that since coming to
Sun, my opinion on this has shifted 180°, from “threads are tough but
worthwhile” to “Let’s find some combination of functional programming and
message passing so ordinary people never see threads”.  Roman has some of the
reasons why.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>REST Hard?</h2>
<p>Patrick Mueller (who’s appeared here before) has
<a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/page/pmuellr?entry=how_resty_need_we_be&amp;ca=dat-bl">how RESTy need we be</a>
wondering, how far down the path of pure REST, as notably taught by Joe
Gregorio, we need to go.  The question is worth asking, but I think Patrick
goes off the rails, claiming “Here's my thought on the lack of adoption of
REST: it’s complicated for anything but the GETs.”</p>
<p>Um, evidence please?  I just finished building a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/06/27/mod_atom-status">100%-pure-REST data
store</a>; it’s only a few thousand lines of code and a few weeks work, and
that’s coding in pure grim unforgiving C, using the poorly-documented and
without-a-safety-net Apache module API.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Identity Lock-in</h2>
<p>Dave Winer’s been saying this
really smart thing for years and years: “People come back to places that send
them away.”  For an example, think of Google. In
<a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/08/03/lockinAndTheWebDay2.html">Lock-in and the web, day 2</a>
he applies the principle to the identity world.  The conclusion: “A vendor
will come along and they’ll store your identity but give you complete freedom
to move it where ever you want when ever you want at no cost. They’ll make it
easy to do so. And they'll get rich doing it, if they want to.” Yup.</p>

<p>Today we have chipmunks and hats and earnings and a novel.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Chipmunks</h2>
<p>People who haven’t been in the woods in the right part of the North
American West.  Think of a smaller, cuter, faster, striped squirrel.  Anyhow,
economist-blogger Brad DeLong has a witty and thoughtful conversation with one
in 
<a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/08/three-miles-eas.html">Three Miles East of East Inlet Trailhead, Rocky Mountain National Park</a>.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Hats</h2>
<p>I have
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/24/Hats">previously written here</a> on
the merits of Akubra hats; they come from
Australia, are stylish and tough generally just the thing.  Unfortunately,
they’re kind of hard to buy, even in Australia.  Well, an online retailer
named David Morgan has an
<a href="http://www.davidmorgan.com/akubra.html">online Akubra store</a>.
I’ll have to give it a try.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Earnings</h2>
<p>Following on Sun’s
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/07/30/RSS-Reporting">online earnings
release</a>, Dominic Jones at <cite>IR Web Report</cite> has penned
<a href="http://www.irwebreport.com/daily/2007/08/01/the-truth-about-suns-web-first-earnings-release/">The truth about Sun’s Web-first earnings release — Update 3</a>.
It’s quantitative and amusing and cynical; Dominic is definitely my kinda
guy.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Rainbows End</h2>
<p>That’s the name of a 2006 novel by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernor_Vinge">Vernor Vinge</a> (hard
sci-fi, relatively well-written, decent airplane reading); 
<a href="http://vrinimi.org/rainbowsend.html">Rainbows End</a> is now online,
with a copyright notice but no other barriers between the text and the
reader.  Well, except for reading a novel in your browser’s default and default
paragraph style <em>really sucks</em> compared to properly-typeset text
inscribed on dead trees.  I had a look and I guess I’ll buy the book for my
next long plane ride.  Hmm... isn’t this what they call “marketing”?</p>

<p>We had a little online Atom Protocol interop session today, via IRC and
servers scattered here and there about the globe.  I got
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/06/27/mod_atom-status">mod_atom</a> to
work with
<a href="http://incubator.apache.org/abdera/">Apache Abdera</a> and 
<a href="http://writer.live.com/ ">Windows Live Writer</a>.  With a couple of
little glitches in each case, fixed on the spot (that’s what the session is
for), we had 100%
squeaky-clean interop.  Earth to client toolmakers: pay attention, or you’re
gonna be eating WLW’s dust.</p>
<p>Here’s an out-take from the IRC, jcheng is

<title>Sunday</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>One of those great summer days.  Baseball, happy boys, good food, and
sunlit flowers, all among friends.</p>
<p>The boy and his friend and I went
to the local <a href="http://www.canadiansbaseball.com/">Single-A</a> ball
game with our friends Peter and Kim and their University-age son Graham.
The baseball was abominable, there were 5 hit batters in the first couple of
innings.  But the company was good, and we had shady seats with a good view on
a nice warm day.  And it was a treat to listen to the two eight-year-olds’
unselfconsciousness immersion into the game and the atmosphere, and the
endless flow of almost entirely content-free chatter.  Then we all went for
dinner with some other guests down at Peter and Kim’s place.</p>
<img src="IMGP6381.jpg" alt="Peter Sharpe and Kim Adamson-Sharpe host friends" />
<p>Peter is a terrific cook.  Historical note: this picture depicts three
people who served on the original XML Working Group: Peter Sharpe, Lauren
Wood, and
<a href="http://magliery.com/">Tom Magliery</a>, and was taken by a fourth.</p>
<p>I don’t normally try to photograph food, but the sun was shining across the
plate in a way that I found fetching.</p>
<img src="IMGP6384.jpg" alt="Peter Sharpe’s barbecue dinner" />
<p>Peter and Kim have flowers on their big patio.
<a href="http://alexwaterhousehayward.com/">Alex Waterhouse-Hayward</a> has
recommended that I shoot flowers in shade not sun, and he knows more about
photography than I ever will, but my eyes can’t resist flowers that have the
shadows of other flowers on them.</p>

<title>1½ Days of APP Interop</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Check the
<a href="http://intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/August2007InteropGrid">results</a>.
This makes me very glad, as did the hours on the IRC, trying code, patching
code, peering at logfiles, laughing at each other... <em>making it work</em>.
This is how the Net gets better.
Like I said last time,
<a href="http://writer.live.com/">Windows Live Writer</a> is da bomb, other
people who are in the blogging-client biz better watch out.</p>
<p>I can’t tell you how pleased I am that software as diverse as the .NET-based
WLW, Alex Milowski’s
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/atomojo/">Atomic</a> Firefox plug in, and
the Snell/IBM heavy-java
<a href="http://incubator.apache.org/abdera/">Apache Abdera</a> client all
managed clean trouble-free interop with
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/06/27/mod_atom-status">mod_atom</a>.  Really,
I have a happy glow in my belly.
Here’s a screenshot of NetNewsWire reading the feed from mod_atom showing a
post, with picture even, planted by WLW.  There are other posts there from
Atomic, wildly different clients, same server, nestling side by side, no
custom code required.  <em>Get
it?</em> </p>
<img src="this-is-mod-atom.jpg" alt="mod_atom generated feed" />
<p>Plus, the Ape got a major workout.  If the work it’s done up through
today is all the use it ever gets, it’ll still have been worth it.</p>
<p>Plus, Google hired Joe Gregorio, the world’s leading APP
implementor/evangelist.  My hope is that he’ll get them to ship OSS code for
their funky proprietary (albeit RFC2617-compliant) authent protocol; then
maybe they’ll be able to back up the claim that GData is really APP.</p>

<p>Our fourteen-month-old has never been a particularly good sleeper, and in
recent weeks it’s been brutal; she’s squalling in bed every so often, and has
a major meltdown in the middle of most nights.  Yeah, we’ve read the books and
done the research and have tried some things and are trying others, some kids
are just lousy sleepers.  Time is on our side.  I
should be going to bed earlier, only it’s summer and the evenings are warm and
my work is compelling and everything’s hurtling forward.  But I apologize in

<title>Watching the Mideast</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There are
<a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/890566.html">glimmers of good
news</a> amidst the wreckage; at least in the 
Israel-Palestine sector.  The shape of the
eventual settlement has been so clear for so long, and the costs of letting
either side’s dimwit maniacs block it are becoming increasingly unbearable.
Hopes have been dashed so many times, and I’m as cynical an observer as you’ll
find anywhere, but I’m having trouble suppressing little surges of
optimism.</p>
<p>It’s not that hard to get a pretty strong feeling for what’s really going
on in that part of the world.  The BBC has
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/default.stm">level-headed
coverage</a>, and if you want clear voices speaking out of the middle of the
maelstrom, there are excellent RSS feeds from Ha’aretz and Al-Jazeera; here
are the four I subscribe to: Ha’aretz 
<a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/objects/pages/eopinionRss.jhtml">Opinion</a>,
<a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/objects/pages/enewsRss.jhtml">News</a>,
and
<a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/objects/pages/enationalRss.jhtml">National news</a>;
and Al-Jazeera’s
<a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/4D6139CD-6BB5-438A-8F33-96A7F25F40AF.htm?ArticleGuid=55ABE840-AC30-41D2-BDC9-06BBE2A36665">main feed</a>.</p>
<p>It is grounds for optimism that the extremist positions are less
loudly proclaimed.  I scouted around both the Jerusalem Post (AKA Likud
Central) and Al-Jazeera
looking for expel-the-Palestinians or expel-the-Jews flag-waving,
and there’s a lot less than there used to be.</p>
<p>One thing has become painfully obvious: the single worst job in
the whole Israel/Palestine mess belongs to the IDF (Israeli army) guys who
have to deal with the relations between the settler lunatics and the locals
they live among.</p>
<p>Check the coverage of today’s news: Al-Jazeera’s
<a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/FBB093E8-EAFB-47CF-ABE1-1BDC36AC2D8F.htm">Israel evicts Hebron settlers</a>
and Ha’aretz’s
<a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/890519.html">At least 15 people
hurt as police evacuate Hebron market homes</a>.  Ha’aretz has more detail,
but Jazeera is stronger on the atmosphere, and has heart-wrenching video
(posted via YouTube; maybe the revolution <em>will</em> be televised).</p>
<p>Over at Ha’aretz,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amira_Hass">Amira Hass</a>, who writes with a raw edge that to me seems
appropriate for the subject matter, says in
<a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=890981&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=4">The Hebron tactic</a>
that this is part of a larger pattern.  Ms Hass’ life is in danger because
very bad people on both sides of this game think that what she writes damages
them.
You want other voices?  They’re not
hard to find, go look.</p>

<title>Blows Against the Empire</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Microsoft is bipedal; its legs are Windows and Office.  I’ve always thought
that Office was the more important, and less open to attack.  But there
insurgents lurking out there in deep space; their attacks are just pinpricks.
So far.</p>
<p>Windows, at the end of the day, is not a
very good operating system.  Some of the pieces of Office, though, are superb,
and would probably have been very successful over the years even without the
file-format lock-in and abusive competitive practices.
In particular, I’d put 
Excel on my personal list of the five best pieces of software ever.
I want to bust the file-format logjam not because I think it’ll sweep Office
away, but competition will make Office cheaper and all the competitors
better.</p>
<p>I hadn’t really paid much attention to the
<a href="http://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a> thing; but then, a couple of
times in recent weeks, I was in gmail and there was a message with a .doc
attached. 
Normally I’d save it and open it with MacOffice; 
I have an elderly but still satisfactory version, but that’s all
screwed up because my new Mac came with a trial version of the latest release,
which I accidentally opened once and it’s bollixed up my fonts somehow.</p>
<p>Then I saw “Open as as a Google Document” and I tried and, you know, it’s
Good Enough.  And snappy.  And free.  And
<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/07/google-apps-goes-global.html">internationalized</a>.
And I’m
<a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/009275.html">not the only
person</a> having this experience.</p>
<p>Yow... thought-provoking.</p>
<p>Now I see that Apple is taking a run at the fortress with
<a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/numbers/">Numbers</a>.  Dunno yet whether
it’s going to be a triumph like Keynote or a stinking piece of crap like iCal,
but the fact that they’re trying is significant.</p>
<p>I’ll be honest, I’d thought that MS-Office on the desktop was going to be a
central feature of the ecosystem for as far forward as I could see.  But maybe
not.</p>

It’s amazing how well things work when you set things up that go with the way
the

<h2 id='p-2'>How to Schematize XML</h2>
<p>Use RelaxNG, not XSD.  Most people already know this, but Alex over at the
Griffin Brown weblog offers

Good stuff.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>JVM Languages Group</h2>
<p>You know, it’s remarkable, there’s all these Ruby implementations going on
in parallel, and they all get along.  Then there’s all these different
JVM-language projects going on, and what do you know, they all pretty well get
along, too (modulo some occasional Groovy grouchiness).</p>
<p>Our own Charles Nutter is trying to build some structure around all this
good fellow-feeling and is making good progress; check out

<title>Sanitation</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>It’s amazing how issues float to the top of multiple minds independently.
I’ve been spending a lot of time thinking about how to sanitize to-be-published
data.
Then Rob Sayre wrote
<a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/rob-sayre/2007/08/06/interoperability-and-xss-mitigation/">Interoperability and XSS Mitigation</a>;
XSS stands for “cross-site scripting”, the main threat that you sanitize to
avoid.
Sam Ruby noticed got active:
<a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/2007/08/07/Interoperability-and-XSS-Mitigation">Interoperability and XSS Mitigation</a>
announced the 
<a href="http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Sanitization_rules">Sanitization rules</a>
wiki-space.
Microsoft’s Joe Cheng is worrying, too.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>mod_atom</h2>
<p>As of now,
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/06/27/mod_atom-status">mod_atom</a> is, as a
pure Atom Store,
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/mod-atom/issues/list?updated=2&amp;ts=1186616330">approaching
1.0 status</a>.  It’s interoperated with every credible client that’s tried.
(Further evidence, were any needed, that the Atom protocol is
Really Simple).
Except for, it’s not finished, for one small and one large reason.
The small reason is that it
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/mod-atom/issues/detail?id=1">doesn’t yet
generate HTML</a> (but that’s not hard).  The big reason is that it’s 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/mod-atom/issues/detail?id=8">not
safe</a>; I can send it HTML loaded with horrible XSS exploits and it’ll stuff
them into Web-space, ready to wreak havoc on the world.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Feedparser’s Whitelist Approach</h2>
<p>What the
<a href="http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Sanitization_rules">Sanitization Wiki
Page</a> doesn’t spell out is that this logic, derived originally from
Feedparser, is whitelist based.  For HTML, it goes through the data, examines
each element <em>and attribute</em>, and lets it survive if it appears on the
“Approved Elements/Attributes” list.</p>
<p>The same approach is used with MathML and SVG markup; CSS is sanitized by
removing the <code>url()</code> pattern and anything that looks like it might
be hiding something bad.</p>
<p>I haven’t seen any pushback against the basic approach, which makes me
happy because it seems very sound to me.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>At Microsoft</h2>
<p>Check out Joe Cheng’s
<a href="http://jcheng.wordpress.com/2007/08/07/atompub-interop-event-notes/">AtomPub interop event notes</a>.
He writes “I’m thinking about implementing a web app that takes any AtomPub
endpoint and makes a blog out of it, although I would love it if someone beat
me to it.”  So he’ll be looking at the same problems.</p>
<p>During the interop we were talking about sanitizing the payload, and I
described the whitelist approach.  Joe pointed out that that simply removing
<code>style</code>, both element and attribute, wouldn’t work for his users,
because authoring tools use this to produce nice visuals that there’s no other
obvious way to get.</p>
<p>So I guess that you could look inside <code>style</code> elements and
attributes and do your CSS-cleanup there <i>in situ</i>.  Hmm.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Where to Sanitize?</h2>
<p>mod_atom actually has some cleanup code right now.  If you post an Atom
entry with text marked <code>type="xhtml"</code>, it applies a whitelist
algorithm much as specified above.  Which is easy, because the Apache server
includes an XML parser that builds a DOM for you, and it’s straightforward to
run around it checking against the whitelist.  The still-unsolved problem is
<code>type="html"</code>, because that requires parsing the HTML.  Blecch.</p>
<p>Right now, the mod_atom cleanup happens as the data comes in, so the
version in the Atompub Collection feeds is sanitized.  I’m beginning to think
that’s wrong, that the Atom Store part of mod_atom should preserve the data
as-is, as much as possible; presumably, those feeds and entries will be
access-controlled, not world-readable.   Then
there should be a <em>separate</em> set of feeds offered to the world for
subscription purposes.  They, and the HTML pages, exist only in the sanitized
state.</p>
<p>But at this stage we’re just making this up as we go along.  It’s really
nice, though, that everyone seems to have realized that the problem is real
and important; and if we can develop a set of Best Common Practices, that’d be
good for everyone.</p>

<body>
<p>The Ape (<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ape/">runnable</a>,
<a href="https://ape.dev.java.net/">source</a>) has a new committer:
<a href="http://www.thinkincode.net/">David Calavera</a>, who’s from Spain. 
He wrote me out of the blue saying “Here are some patches that are the
beginning of an <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt">RFC2617</a>
framework.”  David needed the Ape to talk WSSE for his own work.</p>
<p>This is exactly the area where the Ape needs work.  I think that as far as
exploring the workings of an Atom Protocol implementation, most of the
useful work has been done.  Once you get past that stuff, I’m pretty sure that
the main source of interop pain in the Atom space is going to be
authentication. the Web offers lots of options; fortunately the RFC2617
framework may be useful in sorting things out.</p>
<p>Among other things, David’s patches provide a place to put the code for
GData authentication, once Google provides it.</p>

Finally, the mighty <cite>DPR</cite> has a

<h2 id='p-3'>Pentax Gallery</h2>
<p>Check out the
<a href="http://www.pentaxphotogallery.com/">Pentax Photo Gallery</a>; there’s
a lot of beautiful stuff there.  I found that I actually disliked as much as I
liked;
the colours seemed supersaturated and the presentation generally hyper-real.
I’m certainly guilty of cranking up the intensity in my own shots, but I
thought these guys were really making it obtrusive.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Can You Tell Me Where My Country Lies?</h2>
<p>I can’t tell make up my mind whether
<a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2007/08/guitar-moment-1.html">this</a> is egregious art-rock silliness,
or a triumph of composition, orchestration, and performance.
Having said that, I couldn’t get the stupid tune out of my mind, so I slapped
the CD in the van’s player while I was taking the boy out shopping.  
He, not sharing my burden of having lived through decades of Rock History, said
he liked it.</p>

<p>Facebook offers me irritating little choices, almost every day.  I have a
system for dealing with them.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Friend Requests</h2>
<p>If I know you, sure thing, unless I really dislike you.
If you work for Sun and we’ve ever interacted at all, that’s good enough.
If I don’t recognize the name or the face, I do a big search through all my
email to see if I’ve ever heard from you.  If not, then not.  If so, then I
decide whether we actually had a friendly interaction, in which case yes, or
you just sent me a note about about something, in which case no, unless either
the subject or the note itself was really cool.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Applications</h2>
<p>I’m forever getting prompted to “answer a question” or some other thing
that involves adopting a Facebook Application.  Nope; my experience with FB
apps has been sufficiently miserable that if you want me to load one, you need
to send a personal you-to-Tim note explaining what this thing does and why
it’s worthwhile.</p>

</head>
<body>
<p>It seems to be in the air.  Sam Ruby
<a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/2007/08/12/Long-Bets">plants a stake in
the ground</a>, and isn’t too shy to point at
<a href="http://intertwingly.net/slides/2005/rs/65.html">his track record</a>.
My turn.</p>
<p>Right now is a good time for futures hog-calling; there are lots of changes
that we’re in the middle of, where it’s hard to see what’s on the other
side.</p>
<p><i>Item:</i> Millions of people are directing online energy away from the
wide-open Web into walled gardens like Facebook.  At 
what seems like every
social gathering I’ve attended in months, there’s a conversation that ends up
with the FBers evangelizing the service and bugging others to get on.  Some of
the arguments make my blood run cold: “It’s
like the Net, but safe because you know who everyone is.”  <em>I don’t think
so.</em>  But still, I’m not immune to Facebook’s charms.</p>
<p><i>Item:</i> Computers keep on getting wider.  We just
<a href="http://www.sun.com/featured-articles/2007-0807/feature/index.jsp">shipped this silicon
morsel</a> that’s <em>really</em> wide, and our
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/bmseer/">rude boys</a> are shouting to the world
is just the fastest ever:
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/bmseer/entry/ultrasparc_t2_and_old_ultrasparc">shout</a>
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/bmseer/entry/ultrasparc_t2_more_floating_point">shout</a>
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/bmseer/entry/performance_of_the_new_sun">shout</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, geeks everywhere are
<a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/jaerlang/">thinking
Erlang</a>.  Yep, that book’s sitting here on my desk too, and since I used
Webserver logfile analysis as my
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/07/02/Finding-Things">Beautiful Code</a>
testbed, I’m thinking of seeing how fast ten thousand Erlang processes can
crunch my logs, compared to linear Ruby or Python.</p>
<p><i>Item:</i> The WS-* project is
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/08/13/Tech-Tab-Sweep#p-1">imploding
amusingly</a> and while we can all stand in a circle and chant “REST! REST!
REST!” as long as we want, the tools and best-practices landscape is
distinguished mostly by its emptiness.  What’s the RESTful future look like?
Beats me.</p>
<p><i>Item:</i> Nobody I know, who switches from mainstream static languages to
Ruby or Python or equivalent, wants to go back.  Yet as of today, the
dynamic-language practitioners, compared to the Java/.NET mainstream, are 
off to the right of the decimal point, if you count heads.  It’s nice to be the fastest-growing
member of the ecosystem, but you still get the feeling that some big horny
hoof could descend from on high and squash us like bugs, and nobody would
notice.</p>
<p><i>Item:</i> It is now within our power to
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/09/14/Why-Atom">equip every significant locus of
digital creativity with a “Publish” button</a>.  So, what happens then?</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Sam’s List</h2>
<p>Surprisingly, while I would have agreed with probably four out his five
futuristic bullet points,
<a href="http://intertwingly.net/slides/2005/rs/65.html">last time</a>, I
think I’m down to three at best on this one.</p>
<p>REST, well, yeah; I don’t
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/atompub-charter.html">invest three
years of my life</a> unless I’m pretty bought in.</p>
<p>Hadoop?  Halfway there.  If by Hadoop you mean “Large-scale
functional-programming infrastructure that doesn’t rely on conventional
database thinking, as first seen in Google’s Map/Reduce”, I’m down with that.
But Hadoop itself?  We still don’t know, it’s really the first attempt outside
Google, and I’d be entirely unsurprised if it turns out to have some sort of
horrible flaw that shows up under Internet-scale loads.  I still think the
direction’s important.</p>
<p>Erlang?  I just don’t think so.  Once again, if we’re really talking
symbolically, saying its message-passing, lightweight-threading,
functional-programming, live-patching virtues are important, well, then,
yes.  But Erlang itself?  It’s too weird, and in my brief experiments, the
implementation shows its age; we have in fact learned some things about
software since way back then.  And anyhow, I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/06/07/Concurrency">worry less</a> about
concurrency these days.  The right way get the most mileage out of something
like our T2 is load it up with a bunch of process-granular PHP or Rails or
Django jobs.  Which burns memory, but who cares?  Or alternatively, to run
something like Java EE, stay away from application-level threads, and let the
JVM sweat the concurrency.</p>
<p>Jabber?  Yep.  Wire open a connection to wherever and send one start tag
followed by an infinite number of XML chunklets.  I seem to stumble across
another good application for this every month or so, on average.</p>
<p>Microformats?  Color me unconvinced.  It’s like RDF and the SemWeb; sounds
great in theory, but I’ve been hearing the theory for years and I’m still not
using any applications.  I could be convinced; but only by a killer app.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>My List</h2>
<p>A few of these are very specific.  Hmm... risky.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Green infrastructure, both for public-spirited reasons and because the
juice is pricey and we can’t swing the HVAC. (This may be bigger than the rest
put together.)</p></li>
<li><p>The Atom Protocol, and REST.</p></li>
<li><p>Ruby and Python.  The Web frameworks will lead them there, and they’ll
get a taste, and they won’t come back.</p></li>
<li><p>AJAX, by which I mean the browser getting smarter and better and
quicker and richer, incrementally month by month, until the increments become
qualitative change.  Which happened two or three times already in
the last decade.</p></li>
<li><p>Jabber, like Sam said.</p></li>
<li><p>Ubiquitous functional programming.  But I’m far from convinced we’ve
seen the actual instantiation that gets us there from here.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-1'>Self-Indulgent Postscript</h2>
<p>Writing this kind of thing makes me nervous, because last month Jeff Atwood
asked
<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000809.html">Yes, But What
Have You *Done*?</a> and I don’t wanna be an airhead pundit.  And it’s years
since I spent a whole week doing nothing but code.  And it’s worse than that;
not only am a bloviating commentator, I’m also intermittently a standards
iron-butt, writing rules from on high, the things that turn respectable
geeks into
<a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/08/16/specs">morons and
assholes</a>.</p>
<p>Whatever... I do find time to code, even if it’s not getting 
<a href="https://stpeter.im/?p=2007">Internet-scale deployment</a>.
And I’m an OK coder, but I’ve worked with a few of the great ones and
more than a few who weren’t great but still better than me, so my 
engineering ego is well
under control.  And I’m a decent writer, but I doubt
I’ll ever achieve my childhood dream of publishing a slim book of verse, or
anything at all in a good serious magazine.  I think I’ve basically lucked
into following 
<a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html">Scott
Adams’ career advice</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I think Atwood is overly harsh; the world
needs loudmouths (at least on a part-time basis) as well as engineers.  Having
said that, he’s got a damn fine blog, for example
<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000930.html">Measuring Font
Legibility</a>, which is entirely irresistible to a typography geek named
Bray.</p>

<p>August is supposed to be the slow time of year.  Not!  Is there ever a lot
of interesting stuff out there.
Today we have WS-funnies, OOXML Purdah, Web names,
Internet Registry structures, and Ruby
metaprogramming craziness.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>WS-*, now 6 times better!</h2>
<p>I don’t think anything I say could possibly add value to Paul Krill’s
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/08/09/sca-oasis_1.html">OASIS

From Robin Cover, a

take</a>.</p>
<p><i>[Enough with that deranged snickering! -Ed.]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Office XML Standardization</h2>
<p>There’s so much shouting going on around the effort to get OOXML an ISO
fast-track blessing, you might think it’d be hard to find anyone saying
anything different.  Alex Brown is, in 
<a href="http://adjb.net/index.php?entry=entry070811-114925">OOXML
Purdah</a>.</p> 
<h2 id='p-3'>Naming Things</h2>
<p>This is
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/09/On-XML-Language-Design#p-1">well-known
to be hard</a> in the general case; one of the reasons the Web works is that it
has a tractable approach to the problem; not perfect, but tractable at the
scale of the Internet, which is no small achievement.  This doesn’t mean that
assigning names to things in your Web apps is easy.
In
<a href="http://www.dehora.net/journal/2007/08/web_resource_mapping_criteria_for_frameworks.html">Web resource mapping criteria for frameworks</a>,

<h2 id='p-4'>XML for Internet Registries</h2>
<p>There’s a
<a href="http://www.viagenie.ca/ianaxml/">proposal afoot</a> to store some of
the basic IANA registries in XML.
I’ve been asked my opinion.  I suspect that my readers might have something to
say, which I would appreciate hearing.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>The Methodphitamine</h2>
<p>That’s the name of 
Jay Phillips’ metaprogramming model and 
<a href="http://jicksta.com/articles/2007/08/04/the-methodphitamine">his
write-up of it</a>.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure that as a name, it sucks.  As an example of the apparently
infinite richness lurking under Ruby’s hood, it’s mind-boggling and
awe-inspiring.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I actually <em>like</em> it.</p>

<p>Now, this would be a red-letter day.  I was chasing a weird Ape bug, and I
found the problem: <code>atomURI#absolutize</code> was returning a URI not a
string (and by the way, why doesn’t URI offer String methods like
<code>index</code> and <code>=~</code>!?!  But I digress.)  Anyhow, I 
moaned, thinking “Crap, that’s used <em>everywhere</em>, what am I gonna
break?”
What I needed was “Find Usages”...
Hah!  I’d recently grabbed a new NetBeans 6 pre-release (the 070810 build of
M10) and Tor’s been doing some heavy chest-beating recently.
Here goes with the right-click.</p>
<img src="Find-Usages.png" alt="NetBeans doing Find Usages in ruby code" />
<img src="Usages.png" alt="Find Usages output by NetBeans in ruby code" />
<p>Cowabunga!  Now, maybe it’s the case that TextMate and Eclipse and Idea
have been doing this for years (commenters: have they?), but my personal
Ruby-dev productivity just got a shot in the arm.</p>
<p>Mind you, it also said this:</p>
<img src="Warning.png" alt="Refactoring warning from NetBeans" />
<p>I can imagine all sorts of metaprogramming voodoo that would probably fool
the IDE.  But in this particular case, it Just Worked.</p>
<p>I keep running across nice little goodies in this build.  For example, I
was composing an error message and started to type a <code>#{}</code>
construct to include a variable, and suddenly it was all bollixed up.  A bit
of poking around revealed that as soon as I’d hit <code>#</code>, NetBeans
had added the <code>{}</code> and moved my cursor.  Which is going to be a
win like 90% of the time.</p>
<p>Now, you can visit
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/tor/category/Ruby">the Ruby part of Tor Norbye’s
blog</a> and there are tons of coolio screenshots.
But I think what I need to do is invest some quality time plowing 
through the NetBeans wiki
<a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/wiki/view/Ruby">Ruby Pages</a>.  Hey Tor,
you <em>are</em> keeping those up to date, right?</p>

<body>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399154302?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=anyway-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0399154302">This</a> is the latest novel by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibson">William Gibson</a>.
It’s
<a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2007_03_01_archive.asp#1918048816028054753">set
in early 2006</a>; there is some overlap with the penultimate <cite>Pattern
Recognition</cite>.  It doesn’t depart substantially from the Gibson idiom.  I
liked it a whole lot, but I was cheating.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Just the Facts</h2>
<p>The central plot device is, as in almost every other Gibson work, three
small groups of characters pursuing story-threads in parallel (very close
parallel in one case).
Hubertus Bigend and Blue Ant are back,
and the enigmatic magnate retains the services of a troubled woman to pursue a
poorly-defined 
goal.  Gibson’s done this before, twice; but Hollis Henry is
stronger and less 
fucked-up than either Marly Kruschkova or Cayce Pollard, which makes her
(for me anyhow) more empathetic.  
Also Bigend has become 
less menacing and oblique; it becomes evident fairly early on what he’s trying
to do, and he acts sometimes like a merely-human marketing
pro.
“Spook” in the title
refers to espionage trade-craft, very much, I thought, in the Le Carré style,
which is good.  But the spooks come from somewhere else entirely; entirely
surprising, but plausible.  Kind of like, um, good sci-fi is supposed to
be.</p>
<p>There’s a new and perfectly believable art-form proposed.  Impressive.</p>
<p>There’s some clinical-yet-heartfelt taking-down of the Republican
maggot-brains currently raping the United States’ civic landscape; an easy
target, granted, but still pleasurable to read, and well-done.</p>
<p>The plot is kind of ridiculous, actually.  I could go on for pages
nit-picking, particularly the Brown party: why he keeps Milgrim around to the
end, why he’s so easily fooled by Tito’s gang, and there’s more.
Who cares?  It moves right along and the
language is beautiful and the characters are interesting, which is what ought
to matter in a book.  Also, this plot does not involve any particularly cosmic
consequences for history or the Internet; there are no “nodal points”.
Which I appreciated; it makes for a more human scale.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Cheating</h2>
<p>You might perhaps not want to rely too heavily on my opinion of Gibson’s
books in 
general and this one in particular. First of all, the texture of his writing has
always slid smoothly and pleasurably over the texture of my mind, so I’m
predisposed to like anything he writes.
As with a zillion other Eighties geeks, the Sprawl
series set off fireworks in my head; they still do when I re-read ’em once
every decade or so.</p>
<p>And this book in particular, well, the last quarter or so happens right
here in Vancouver, right now.  Gibson and I live in different neighborhoods;
we work out at the same place about halfway between and, while we haven’t met,
it seems that we enjoy the same parts of town.
One of the nice things about his 
writing is the almost-hallucinatory vividness of the descriptions, the sense
of place.   When he was doing sci-fi, a scene would occur in a derelict space
station or a robot car or a ruined landmark and the sense would be
overwhelming that, yes, this is exactly what it would feel like to be in 
that place.</p>
<p>And I’ve actually been in pretty well all of the Vancouver
spaces in this book; obviously some are not literal, but I’ve been where he
got the ingredients from.  And I’ve actually thought that parts of Strathcona
and the Terminal Avenue wasteland and north Clark Drive had a kind of
postmodern cyberpunky feel.</p>
<p>I don’t know, maybe for someone who doesn’t live here, that last quarter of
the book might feel different, maybe less intense, than your typical Gibson
<i>denouement</i>.  For me, of course, it was twice as intense.</p>
<p>And then, like quite a few other subscribers, I was reading his writing about
writing, and the little
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/03/10/Next-Gibson">early-draft fragments</a>, on
<a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/blog.asp">his blog</a> while
<cite>Spook Country</cite> was under construction.  It
makes you feel bought-into the book before it even hits the shelves.  Is there
a lesson here for other authors?</p>

Salieri and Empty Rooms.</p>
<img src="IMGP6573.jpg" alt="Royal Sunset rose blossom against blue sky" />
<p>You know, I work hard at this writing thing.  I’ll take a paragraph and
re-do it and re-do it and pump my fist in the air (well, internally anyhow)
when I find a way to take out three words and a comma, because less is more.</p>
<p>Remember the scene in <cite>Amadeus</cite> when Salieri was
chicken-scratching away at this piece of music and finally moved it along a
bit and Gave Thanks To God right there &amp; then?  That’s how I feel.</p>
<p>Playing Mozart’s role would be Paul Ford, as in

<body>
<p>I posted that
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/08/16/Royal-Sunset">apricot-rose picture</a>
last night, late, and when I looked at it on the big screen at work this
morning, I thought “Ouch, that’s borked”.  It turns out that I’d cranked
Lightroom’s “Fill Light” control all the way over to the right, liking the
effect on the centre of the blossom, missing the damage elsewhere.</p>
<p>So I tried another take at it, trying to preserve some
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/03/15/Photointegrity">photointegrity</a>.
But then I decided that while I liked the second cut better, the first was not
without its virtues and I couldn’t bring myself just to over-write it.  So
here are both, and your chance to have an opinion.</p>
<img src="IMGP6573.jpg" alt="Too-heavily-processed rose picture" />
<img src="RS-2.jpg" alt="Less-heavily-processed rose picture" />
<p>See, the “Fill Light” control produces that weird and rather nice glow in
the dark part of the blossom, but generates all sorts of weird artifacts on
the green stems.</p>
<p>Maybe if I have insomnia tonight, I’ll break out full-bore Photoshop and
get with the masking and see if I can have the best of both worlds.
And I gotta say, what a nice flower that is.</p>

<title>Tidying HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’ve decided that
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Software#p-4">mod_atom</a> really needs to be a
blog-publishing system, not just an Atom Store.  And furthermore, based mostly
on the comments to
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/08/09/Sanitation">that Sanitation piece</a>,
I’ve made two design decisions.  First, the sanitizing happens only on the
HTML output; the Atom-store part will persist the data as close as possible to
the way it was sent upstream.  Second, I’m going to try using the
<a href="http://tidy.sourceforge.net/libintro.html">TidyLib</a> parser to pick
apart <code>type="html"</code> text constructs so I can clean ’em up.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Why Tidy?</h2>
<p>The other candidate was
<a href="http://xmlsoft.org/">libxml2</a>, and online research failed to
reveal any hands-on comparisons of the two, but it also failed to turn up
anyone seriously dissing either HTML parser.  So then I noticed that the
libxml2 binary was like 3.8M, while TidyLib is under 400K.  Of course, 
to be fair, libxml2 does tons of other useful stuff that I don’t care about.</p>
<p>So after a couple of days’ part-time poking around, I figured out how to
compile TidyLib and mod_atom together and load the result into httpd.</p>
<p>Now let’s see how it goes.  I must say that I’m a little intimidated by
<a href="http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/api/struct__TidyAllocator.html">Tidy’s 
memory allocator</a>.  That’s extremely, uh, extreme.  I suppose I can figure
it out. Compare
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/genx/docs/Guide.html#genxSetAlloc">Genx’s</a>.
Am I too simple-minded?</p>
<p>As soon as I stop blogging I’m going to try to wire it up.  Surely I have
some big thick books or corporate strategies or social-software trends to
review first?</p>

seems to me dazzlingly simple to understand.  Both of us think there’s money
to be made in supporting Solaris, and IBM apparently thinks there are system
sales to be facilitated by including Solaris in the package.
We think that any time anyone’s using one of our products, that makes them a
better candidate to use more of our products.
On the other hand, pundits like Dana Blankenhorn look into the bottom of their

<title>Tab Sweep — The World</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This time we have journalism, civic politics, and a rare 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> side-trip into, well, sex.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Journalism Here in Vancouver</h2>
<p>We’re into the fourth week of a civic-workers strike.  The garbage isn’t
getting picked up, a lot of kids’ summer day-camps are closed (real hardship
for single parents), and it’s generally nasty. 
All the suburban municipalities have settled.  The city workers I
know all say they want a deal about like the burb workers got; but the union
and management mostly aren’t talking.  Why not?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the local newspaper is giving us exactly zero drill-down or
depth of coverage on the story.  Fortunately, an excellent local online
publication, the Tyee,
<a href="http://thetyee.ca/News/2007/08/16/EndlessSummer/">does some
actual journalism</a>.  I’m still puzzled.  The city says they
offered the union a deal like the burbs got.  The union flatly denies it.
Somebody’s lying.  Each side accuses the other, darkly, of a hidden political
agenda.  The citizens, I bet, would be largely unsurprised if either set of
accusations turned out to be true.</p>
<p>Maybe the Tyee doesn’t have the reach to embarrass them
on this, but the local broadsheet ought to have dug this up, and ought to be
running the “Who’s Lying!?!?” story on the front page <em>every day</em> until
someone comes clean.</p> 
<p>Shame on you, Vancouver Sun.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Journalism and Competence</h2>
<p>While we’re dissing the mainstream... at Brad DeLong’s site, an
excellent proposal, which I fully support:
<a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/08/the-baseball-te.html">The
Baseball Test for Journalists</a>.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Did I Mention Sex?</h2>
<p>Well, actually, I didn’t.  But my brother Rob has an entry on the subject,
unimaginatively entitled
<a href="http://takingalongview.blogspot.com/2007/08/xxx.html">XXX</a>.  I
recommend it.</p>

<p>I’m on the prairies for the week; we do this every summer.  I’d been
looking forward to showing the kids
to the grandmothers, enjoying the landscape, and getting some hours of
uninterrupted work in away from the phones.  What I wasn’t looking forward to
was my MacBook acting sick, crashing three times this morning, rebooting when
I close the lid.  Sigh.  And there’s email from people having trouble with both

<title>NASDAQ: JAVA</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Wow, they switched the ticker.  It
will be little surprise to hear that the internal conversation has been 
sustained and loud.  While there have been negatives along the lines of “OMG
WTF PHB!?!?”, most of the internal talk has echoed what they’re saying out
in the blogosphere.  I’d like to add a couple of points I haven’t seen
elsewhere, one each on the pro and con side.</p>
<p>My own take?  I hate it.
But that’s mostly because I’m a search guy.  SUNW
was a 4-character (32-bit!) identifier, unique in just about any context,
meaning, “The publicly-traded equity of Sun Microsystems, Inc.”  
Such a token seems precious to me.
Now, our best
equivalent is “NASDAQ:JAVA”.  Which will be perfectly effective in the
hands of financial professionals, but some Technorati and Googleblogs feeds
just became much less effective, I think.</p>
<p>On the positive side, I’d like to quote
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/superpat/">Pat Patterson</a>, from an internal
mailing list:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s no bad thing for every business/financial report on the
company to contain the string “Sun Microsystems, Inc. (NASDAQ: JAVA)” rather
than “Sun Microsystems, Inc. (NASDAQ: SUNW)”.</p></blockquote>

<title>Pantone’s Missed Chance</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Today I see, via
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/">John Gruber</a>, that 
<a href="http://www.pantone.com/">Pantone</a> has been
<a href="http://www.macobserver.com/article/2007/08/24.8.shtml">acquired</a>
by <a href="http://www.xrite.com/home.aspx">X-Rite</a>.  In 1995, I gave
Pantone’s CEO some advice that might have made them a lot of money.  He didn’t
take it, but it’s an amusing story.</p>
<p>What happened was, I was a Vice-President and founder of
<a href="http://www.opentext.com/">Open Text</a>, then mostly in the search
and retrieval business, which was at that time part of the publishing
business.  We’d long been attendees of the “Seybold Seminars”, for many years
the Conference that Mattered in the publishing-tech business.  When Open Text
suddenly hit the big time in 1995 with one of the first Web Search
Engines, I became something of a Web Authority, and spoke regularly on the
subject at Seybold.</p>
<p>That year, we had a partnership with Yahoo! (the employee count was still
in the low double digits, but they had white-hot buzz).  At that fall’s
Seybold, I was invited to the “Founders’ Dinner” at a really nice
San Francisco restaurant.  I called the hosts and asked if I could
bring Jerry Yang from this weird new Web-Startup world along.  Jerry got a
lot of attention; the Web was absolutely <i>Terra Incognita</i> to those guys
at that time. </p>
<p>Later in the evening, I was chatted up by the Pantone CEO, a grizzled guy
in a rumpled suit.  He asked “Is there anything Pantone could do to make its
mark on this new Internet thing?”.</p>
<p>The answer seemed obvious.  I said “Well, color online mostly sucks, and
that’s partly because computer geeks mostly totally don’t understand it.  Why
don’t you guys write some software that takes a Pantone number as input and
really works hard, using everything it knows about your computer and operating
system and monitor and video card, to
come as close to that color as you’re gonna get, on-screen.”</p>
<p>He asked “Well, how do I make money?”</p>
<p>I said “Give the software away to Netscape and Microsoft (for IE).  If
it’s good, millions of page designs on the Net will be specced in Pantone
numbers.  Your upside is huge.”</p>
<p>He looked at me like I was completely fucking nuts.  To his credit, he was
polite, but it was obvious he thought I was from another planet.</p>
<p>I dunno, I think it might have worked.  And we might have better-looking
Web pages too.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Postscript</h2>
<p>Writing this made me feel nostalgic for the Yahoo! of way back then.
I did some poking around, and the original directory that fueled the first
stage of that particular Internet Rocket 
<a href="http://search.yahoo.com/dir">is still there</a>.  But you really have
to look to find it.</p>

this whole

There are a whole lot of arrows pointing the same direction: The rising, and
generally uncontrollable, cost of energy.  The 
space and HVAC constraints in modern data centers. <em>The future of
the planet.</em>  It’s not (quite) an
emergency yet, but there are plenty of environmental, economic, and political
scenarios that could land us in (not entirely figurative) hot water pretty
damn quick, alone or in combination.  I
suspect the whole industry’s going to be climbing in this bandwagon; it would
be irresponsible not to.</p>

<p>The pictures here, in their inline form, are now all 400 pixels wide, not
300; I think that looks a lot better.  Did resizing them all ever burn a lot
of CPU.
Also, the sidebar has been cleaned up, there’s a
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Software">software</a> link there
that consolidates some bits of code I’ve emitted over the years; with a little
homily in the first paragraph, even.</p>
<p>There are a bunch more little changes in the comment system and the page
styles and so on queued up, waiting for cycles.  Plus I spent a half-hour the
other day watching my logfiles in real time, and spotted some damn puzzling
evidence that’s going to need investigating.</p>
<p>Traffic is way up, that’s good I
guess.  Except for, the upstream flow is out of control.  I’ve got a
scary-long list of things I need to write about, professional and personal,
including some big pieces, and there’s absolutely no point publishing more
than two or three fragments a day here; I’d like it if people who have jobs
and lives and so on could more or less keep up.</p>
<p>Plus I haven’t unloaded the little camera in weeks, and I know there’s some
good stuff on there.</p>
<p>Plus, getting
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Software#p-5">mod_atom</a>
to write HTML is a lot of unchallenging but time-consuming work.  Plus I keep
thinking of new things
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Software#p-4">the Ape</a> should test; but maybe there
are enough implementations that we don’t need to keep polishing it?</p>
<p>Plus the autumn-through-spring conference and meeting grind is rushing
toward me alarmingly fast.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I apologize in advance if it’s a little uneven and hurried around
here.</p>

<title>5★♫: Kremer Plays Bach</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’ve been fishing in Twentieth-century five-★ waters of late, 
so let’s
cast our eyes back on music written by dead guys.  There have
been a few classical works
that I’ve heard one artist play, then never bothered to take the time to
listen to anyone else’s take.  For example,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gidon_Kremer">Gidon Kremer’s</a> 1980
recording of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonatas_and_partitas_for_solo_violin">Violin
Sonatas and Partitas</a> by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach">J.S. Bach</a>.
This might be a tough sell: two hours of music containing
no notes much below middle C, and no more than two notes ever played at the
same time.  And Kremer is all about Truth not Beauty, which
is to say he doesn’t sugar-coat Bach’s rough edges.  But I think that
<a href="/ongoing/Truth">truth</a> <em>is</em> beauty, and I think that this
music has so much of both that you really ought to sit down sometime and listen
to all of it.  Well, and it sounds good.
<i>(“5★♫” series introduction <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music">here</a>;
with <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music#p-1">an
explanation</a> of why the title may look broken.)</i></p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Context</h2>
<p>I’ve written 
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=bach&amp;as_sitesearch=tbray.org">plenty
about J.S. Bach</a>, especially
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/BWV-131">here</a> and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/02/Goldberg">here</a>.  I’ve written about
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/07/03/Tabula-Rasa">Kremer</a>. And this whole
space is about
<a href="/ongoing/Truth">truth</a>.</p>
<img src="kremer.jpg" alt="Gidon Kremer" />
<div class="caption"><p>This image of Gidon Kremer is copyright Stefan Bremer, from
<a href="http://www.kuhmofestival.fi/25tiistai.htm">here</a>.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Music</h2>
<p>I just don’t know what to say.  Listen to the first few seconds, and you’ll
know right away whether this is going to become an permanent part of your
mental landscape, or whether it’s just a screechy fiddle playing way too many
notes that don’t seem to go anywhere.</p>
<img src="BWV1001.jpg" alt="Page from BWV1001" />
<p>I’d it it to my personal list of things to be considered in evidence
as to why <i>Homo Sapiens</i> should be considered, on balance, a Good Thing
for the universe to include.</p>
<p>If there’s a Greatest Hit in here, it’s the Preludio from Partita 3, BWV
1006; which has been quoted and re-used enough times to enter the racial
memory.  I don’t think it’s the best track. I’d tell you what I do think is
the best but that’d be irrelevant, because every time I put this CD on I end
up listening to both disks, end-to-end.  It’s great-in-the-whole, great enough
that singling out one part or another would be irrelevant.</p>
<img class="inline" src="1980-Kremer-Bach.jpg" alt="The 1980 Gidon Kremer recording of Bach solo works" />
<h2 id='p-3'>Sampling It</h2>
<p>As Wikipedia notes, there are a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonatas_and_partitas_for_solo_violin#Recordings_on_violin">whole 
lot of recordings</a>, by basically every violinist you’ve ever heard of.
I’ve listened to a couple of others but none have won my heart away from
Kremer’s 1980 take; I’ve always thought the sound had a bit too much echo, but
still, there’s very little between you and the fiddle, which is as it should be.
Two things should be noted: this music  
leaves so much room for the interpreter’s soul that it would be really
unsurprising if you liked it, but preferred another recording.  Second, in
researching this article I discovered that Kremer took another run at the
material in 2002, on
<a href="http://www.ecmrecords.com/Catalogue/New_Series/1900/1926.php">ECM New
Series 1926</a> (more discussion
<a href="http://www.ecmrecords.com/Background/Background_1926.php">here</a>).
Since ECM is one of my favorite music shops, I think I’m just gonna have to
pick that one up too.</p>
<p>You can listen to samples of both at Amazon.  This isn’t about downloading,
it’s about buying
shiny silver round things and listening to them late at night with the lights
out.</p>

<p>Someone named “C.K. Sample III” emailed me with an invite to try something
called Mahalo, which I gather is a hot subject among the A-listers.  I was
on a boring telecon, so I fired up Firefox and gave it a try.  Hey, it said
“Mahalo's search results only include great links.”  The results are
hilarious.</p>
<p>Mahalo is a Firefox thingie that adds both sidebar and toolbar clutter.
It watches what you type in the search window and gives you its
own version, so you can compare.  I tried a few:</p>
<table cellpadding="4">

<p>There’s some upside here: I’d never seen a picture of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisele_B%C3%BCndchen">Gisele Bündchen</a>

<p>On the other hand, it did an OK job on “DRM”, “Stardust”, and

<p>I’m hardly alone in being fascinated by the current financial tumult; all
these mortgage-backed financial instruments, and nobody really knows how much
they’re worth.  If there’s good news, it’s that the immediate short-term
bloodletting will mostly involve high-roller investors, 
hedge-fund customers, those best able to afford it.  Will it
spill over into the broader economy?  My personal bet is probably not.  But
anyhow, I don’t have anything new to say on the subject.  I think

<title>Tab Sweep — Tech</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There were a few here that I wanted to do a whole piece about, but I just
gotta clear some space on these decks.  Today we have pushing and pulling and
queueing and Ruby.next and Java hate and PHP-vs.-Rails.  What’s not to like?</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Atom and Pushing and Pulling and Buffering</h2>
<p>Start with Mike Herrick’s
<a href="http://fuzzypanic.blogspot.com/2007/08/pubsub-vs-atom.html">Pub/Sub
vs. Atom &amp; AtomPub?</a>, which has lots of useful links.  I thought Bill
de hÓra’s
<a href="http://www.dehora.net/journal/2007/08/rates_of_decay_xmpp_push_http_pull.html">Rates of decay: XMPP Push, HTTP Pull</a>
was especially interesting on the “Push” side of the equation.</p>
<p>But they’re both missing an important point, I think.  There are two
problems with Push that don’t arise in Pull: First, what happens when the
other end gets overrun, and you don’t want to lose things?  And second,
what happens when all of a sudden you have a huge number of clients wanting to
be pushed to?  This is important, because Push is what you’d like in a lot of
apps.  So it doesn’t seem that important to me whether you push with XMPP or
something else.</p>
<p>The obvious solution is a buffer, which would probably take the form of a
message queue, for example
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMQP">AMQP</a>.  Assuming it’s reliable
and performant, this should solve both the receiver-overrun problem and the
many-receivers problem.  I’ve been
expecting message-queuing to heat up since
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/05/11/ReachPSB">late 2003</a>.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Ruby.next</h2>
<p>Over at Eigenclass,
<a href="http://www.eigenclass.org/hiki/Changes+in+Ruby+1.9">Changes in Ruby
1.9</a> is a snapshot of the long-under-construction next
generation of the language, to be released as Ruby 2.0 whenever the
1.9 development version is considered finished.  Important stuff.</p>
<p>Ruby these days is a delta not a river, with a lot of individual stream,
fortunately still well-connected with each other.  Another stream, of course, is
JRuby, which
<a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/2007/08/jruby-101-and-jython-22-released.html">just
released 1.0.1</a> (and check Charles’ Jython pointer too).</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Russ Disses Java</h2>
<p>Russ Beattie, that is, in
<a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/blog/java-needs-an-overhaul">Java needs
an overhaul</a>.  Well, yeah, a lot of people whine about the same things that
Russ does, and actually he’s got some constructive suggestions.</p>
<p>Look, I work every day on evangelizing Ruby and other dynamic languages,
both inside and outside Sun.  But let’s get real:
Java still remains by far the largest development ecosystem,
and the selection and quality of libraries put pretty well any other
language’s to shame, and it’s <em>really fucking fast</em>, and has superb
tooling, and we know how to
run it securely, and it’s Open-Source.  So, if you want to move the state of
the art along, a smart idea would be to work <em>with</em>, not against,
Java.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Web Frameworks</h2>
<p>Terry Chay, in
<a href="http://terrychay.com/blog/article/simple-prescriptions-and-making-choices.shtml">Simple prescriptions and making choices</a>,
says a whole lot of really smart things about Rails and PHP and so on, and
disses both Joel Spolsky and Paul Graham entertainingly (Hey, I’m a big fan of
both of ’em); it’s worth reading.</p>
<p>I flatly disagree with one of his statements: “The PHP world doesn’t need
to take advice on how to run their community from the Rails world. As crazy as
PHP is (and it is pretty crazy), it’s very clear which is the more mature
language and community.”  Well, there’s more to life than maturity, and I’d
have to say the Ruby &amp; Rails communities have something to teach pretty
well every other online community I know, in terms of open-ness,
friendliness, and constructiveness.  Definitely including PHP.</p>
<p>But the rest, well, it’s just full of good stuff.  For example: “Can you
build WordPress in Rails?” is the wrong question.  You’ll have to read the
piece to learn the right one.</p>

<p>OK, here’s the problem.  It’s a warm day, and kind of stuffy, and what
you’re working on isn’t <em>that</em> interesting, and you’re really having
trouble keeping a grip.  Here’s the solution: double iced latte!</p>
<p>Did I say “not that interesting”?  Hah.  The routines for adding HTML output
to
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Software#p-5">mod_atom</a> are the most tedious bloody
code I’ve written since I did the I/O 
subsystem, in COBOL, for the Toronto Airport staff dispatcher, in 1982 or
so.  Here’s a dirty secret: mod_atom, I think, does something really useful
and may have a future.  However, it’s not, actually, you know, interesting
inside.  But I digress.</p>
<p>What you do is drop by your local coffee joint and order a double-shot
latte with ice.  Lauren says this isn’t a <em>real</em> iced coffee, which in
Germany comes with ice-cream. And you sure can’t drink it the way they give it
to you; it’s incredibly bitter.  So you put in two or three large spoonfuls of
brown sugar.  You have to stir really a lot because coarse brown sugar doesn’t
dissolve that readily in icy fluid.  And in fact you get some not-unpleasant
bits of crunchy sugar through the straw.  Cowabunga, let’s crunch some
code!</p>

<title>ISO OOXML Craziness</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’ve generally been ignoring all the fuss &amp; bother about OOXML’s
well-greased path to ISO anointment.  I’d assumed that after ECMA
had applied rigorous and impartial scrutiny to all six thousand pages, ensuring
that this was straightforwardly implementable by all interested parties, then
the
ISO rubber stamp wouldn’t be long in following, giving us an International
Standard no less, plus fresh insight into the level of respect such things
deserve; and we could all get on with life.
Now, the ISO process seems to be turning into the most entertaining kind of
standards mosh-pit, with loud accusations of corruption and malpractice.
Canadians in the crowd will be reminded of the 
flavor of a Liberal Party nomination meeting.  Groklaw’s coverage is
predictably overamped, but still fun; here’s news from
<a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20070830164228985">France</a>,
<a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20070830155109351">Sweden</a>,
and <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=200708301301334">Norway</a>.
That’s just one day’s worth.
<i>[Update: Hey,
<a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20070831002558681">Denmark
too</a>!]</i></p>
<p>The morning after... here’s
<a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/newsandmedia/pressrelease.htm?refid=Ref1070">the
official story</a>.  New York Times got a 
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/04/technology/04soft.html?ref=business">jump
on the news</a>, and, uh, oops! Andy Updegrove 
<a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/article.php?story=2007090315253367">had
it nailed</a> eighteen hours ahead of the call, though.  Tip o’ the hat to
Andy.</p>
<p>I want to say that I’m shocked, <em>shocked</em>, by 
the <em>appalling</em> cynicism in Mary Jo Foley’s
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=694">Why Microsoft deserved to
lose the OOXML standards vote</a>: “This battle’s not about interoperability,
motherhood and apple pie: It’s about Microsoft wanting to keep its
desktop-suite monopoly and its competitors seeking ways to break Redmond’s
stranglehold on this part of Microsoft’s business.”</p>
<p>Microsoft’s
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2007/sep07/09-04OpenXMLVotePR.mspx">official
take</a> is really a top-notch piece of spin, but they do have a point, you
know; the story is not over.</p>
<p>If I understand the ISO process correctly, had OOXML made it over both
of the vote thresholds that it missed, its supporters could have
adopted what’s
come to be known as the 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/04/02/WS-Silliness">WS-Fed Gambit</a>
in dealing with all the comments and objections.  Near as I can
tell, either the spec will have to get enough changes and patches to convince a
bunch of P-Members to change their “No” to “Yes”, or someone (not naming
names) will need to find a bunch more instant P-Members to join Cote d'Ivoire,
Cyprus, 
Ecuador, Jamaica, Lebanon, Malta, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey,
Uruguay and Venezuela, in adding enough “Yes” votes to enable the WS-Fed
Gambit.</p>
<p>So stand by for lots more rock-’em, sock-’em smash-mouth ISO fun!</p>

<title>Upcoming Gig: Midwest Java Days</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’ll be doing the opening keynotes at the
<a href="http://www.sunmidwestjavadays.com/">Midwest Java Technology Days</a>
in
<a href="https://www.suneventreg.com//cgi-bin/register.pl?EventID=1651">Minneapolis</a>
and
<a href="https://www.suneventreg.com//cgi-bin/register.pl?EventID=1652">Chicago</a> on October 16th and 18th respectively.  There’s an
amusing story behind this one.</p>
<p>I signed up for the Midwest tour last week.  At the beginning of this week,
we had an internal conference call about a workshop we’re doing at the
<a href="http://www.web2summit.com/">Web 2.0 Summit</a>.  We came up with
something pretty good, I think; it’ll give that crowd a charge.  The next day
I got asked if I’d get someone else to do the Midwest thing and instead drive
the workshop at the fabulously-expensive, ultra-high-end, ever-so-exclusive
(invite-only) Summit in glamorous San Francisco.  I didn’t hesitate
for a second.  I’d rather talk to 
real developers in the middle of the country any day than VCs and 
Executives and Movers and Shakers in San Fran.</p>
<p>Anyhow, everybody knows that I’m the
designated wild-eyed radical about openness and choice and flexibility and
time-to-market; we need to have someone with a VP title who’s in middle of the
Sun mainstream taking that message to those people.  
Anyhow, I spend my time worrying
about how to build Web 2.0 and make it actually run, and the Summit attendees
are about inventing the new concepts, building businesses around them, and
looking for that liquidity event.</p>
<p>There are some presentations I’ll be sorry to miss, though.  
Most of all
<a href="http://www.web2summit.com/cs/web2007/view/e_spkr/1148">Adam
Bosworth</a>, probably.</p>

<p>It’s hard for corporate Web sites to be interesting.  My feeling is that
generally, you’d like them to make it easy for people to find what they need,
and otherwise get out of the way.  Having said that, there are two Sun-Web
things that, just in the last week, gave me a big smile.  First,
<a href="http://wikis.sun.com/display/FOSSdocs/Home">FOSS Open Hardware
Documentation</a>.  One of the major obstacles faced by the people who build
Free and Open-Source operating systems (i.e. us, the penguinistas, and the
BSDers) is getting the hardware builders to publish specs;
historically, they’ve been frightened of those weird open-source hippies.
Well, we’re a hardware builder, and that page is trying to aggregate all the
specs that kernel-builders might need.
<a href="http://www.webmink.net/">Simon Phipps</a> tells me that this is a big
job, with lots of 
legal due-diligence, and it’ll never be complete.  But at least a good start.
Second, check out 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpR_6y-OoRc">this screencast</a> about 
<a href="http://wikis.sun.com/">wikis.sun.com</a>.  When this went by in the

<p>Tonight we have the great Audio Conflict of Interest, eBay Pain, Iranian
politics,  Chinese macroeconomics, new Israel/Palestine horror, men vs. women,
and the big debt problem.  Unifying themes are for weaklings; the world’s not
like that.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Compression vs. Truth</h2>
<p>Real music being played in real spaces by real musicians is sometimes
crushingly loud, other times caressingly quiet.  This is good.  Quality audio
systems try to capture this goodness.  But on an iPod, when you’re sitting in an
airplane, this is <em>not</em> good.
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070823-audiophiles-vs-the-ipod-the-battle-over-loudness.html">Ars
Technica has the story</a>.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>eBay vs. Craigslist</h2>
<p>Russ Beattie tries to sell an XBox, you’d think one of the basic
things the Internet is for; he suffers
<a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/blog/ebay-strike-threeeeeee">extreme
eBay pain</a> and then finds 
<a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/blog/craigslist-rocks">Craigslist
relief</a>.  Is there a big trend lurking here?</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>China Stands Up</h2>
<p>The ordinary people I mean, and by standing up I mean
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/29/business/worldbusiness/29labor.html?ex=1346040000&amp;en=32344d3ca1cb0f2d&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss">asking for a decent
wage</a>.  I’ve been predicting this for years, and I can’t see how it’s not the
world’s most important economic trend.  For a decade now, macroeconomics have
been dominated by Chinese manufacturing based on cheap Chinese labor, but
<em>that doesn’t last</em>.  It never has.  And once the outsourcers’ great
global trot around the planet after low wages has exhausted the
potential of China’s 1.3 billion, well, where to next?  What does a world like
where you decide to make things based on location and skills inventory and
resource access and infrastructure, as opposed to where the pay sucks?  We
have no idea.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Al-Jazeera on Iran</h2>
<p>If you care about anything Middle-East related, you really ought to be
reading Al-Jazeera.  Take
<a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/9A09BDC8-15DE-46B0-B48A-7B3569901B73.htm">Iran replaces Guards commander</a>,
which reads to me like big political news.  Why isn’t it getting mainstream
coverage?</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>The Horror</h2>
<p>There are hardly words for how painful this is to read:
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/world/middleeast/02westbank.html?ex=1346385600&amp;en=47149c09377af05d&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss">West Bank Boys Dig a Living From Settler Trash</a>.
Everyone knows what the final settlement is going to look like... can’t the
bleeding be stopped?</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Men vs. Women</h2>
<p>Prof. Baumeister asks
<a href="http://www.psy.fsu.edu/%7Ebaumeistertice/goodaboutmen.htm">Is There
Anything Good About Men?</a> and makes some telling points about the way; but
I eventually ended up wishing his piece were on paper so I could throw it
across the room.</p>
<p>All these clever questions and well-crafted arguments, and
yet this kind of writing is at the same time terribly dangerous, because
people confuse statistics with truth, and they’re not the same thing at all.
Statistics are <em>useful</em>; essential, even, to understanding.  But
everybody is an exception, in at least one statistical minority, and the human
mind is so prone to overaggressive pattern-matching.  I am 100% sure that
this work will be used to justify all sorts of oppression of the individual
based on not conforming to behaviors that may apply, statistically, to some
group she or he is a member of.</p>
<p>Mind you, I’m biased, partly because of being married to a Physics
Ph.D. who sysadmins the Debian box in the basement and can edit a Windows
registry without breathing hard.  Arguments that begin with phrases sounding
like “Women think...” or “Men want...” cut no ice around here.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>Mortgage Clarity</h2>
<p>These days, there’s precious little clarity in the debt market.
But the Times’
<a href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article2332084.ece">While you were away - fear and loathing in the markets</a>
at least explains lucidly why the view is so obscured.  Money quote: “Anyone
loaded up with cash is in a strong position to buy assets cheaply.”  Yep.</p>

<title>Long-Weekend Fun</title>

<body>
<p>So, hey, it’s the last weekend before school starts and everything gets
real again.  So we should be kicking back, right?  As in,
working on Atom Protocol and WordPress.</p>
<p>Leading the charge has been
<a href="http://wanderingbarque.com/nonintersecting/">Pete Lacey</a>, who’s
taken this on and, starting with
<a href="http://torrez.us/">Elias Torres’ code</a>, put a great big butt-load
of work into it. 
Sitting at the center and co-ordinating it all is Sam Ruby, who’s already
<a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/2007/08/30/WordPress-2-3-AtomPub">reported</a>,
but that was Thursday and it wasn’t till late Sunday that we got
the Ape error count down to zero.</p>
<p>From the WordPress side of things,
<a href="http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/">Joseph Scott</a> patiently
explained things and shepherded the process along.</p>
<p>I sat in the background and translated some less-than transparent
complaints from <a href="/ongoing/misc/Software#p-4">the Ape</a>,
patched it up when some piece of WordPress weirdness provoked the
dreaded “Ape fall down go boom” message, and otherwise cheerled.</p>
<p>Anyhow,
<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_2.3">WordPress 2.3</a> is going to
be a first-rate Atom Protocol server.</p>
<p><i>[Update: Heh, here it is 9:27PM on Monday, and now we’re getting some
deep weirdness going on in testing against PHP4 as opposed to PHP5.  The beat
goes on...]</i></p>

<p>It wasn’t that great; there was some good weather
but not enough, and much of that while we were off in Berlin or Saskatchewan.
But there were compensations, family things.</p>
<img src="IMG_0449.jpg" alt="Three Yaletown Buildings" />
<div class="caption"><p>A rare sunny afternoon; this is actually three
different buildings, near the bottom of Homer street in Yaletown, but they
compose themselves nicely.</p></div>
<p>Peter had extra tickets, so we took the boy (just turned eight) to a
football game.  I had fun clicking with the 70-210 Tamron from way up in the
cheap seats, and learned that I should have cranked the ISO more.  To be
honest, I’d rather watch football on TV.  Still, the boy had a blast.</p>
<img src="IMGP6444.jpg" alt="Winnipeg Blue Bombers vs. B.C. Lions" />
<p>It’s just crazy here; everything, <em>everything</em> is under
construction.  Here are some guys doing practical trigonometry.  Amusing
sidelight: this house is #69 East on the same street on which we are #69
West.  To make it worse, there used to be a guy named “Tim” living there.
Poor postie.</p>
<img src="IMG_0444.jpg" alt="Practical geometry" />
<p>We’ve been enjoying our kids; the eight-year-old seems just incredibly
mature, partly by contrast with the baby, but partly he’s just growing up.
The girl, she’s developing serious baby skillz; not (quite) walking or talking
yet, but all sorts of spoon-and-food technique; loves being tossed
around.  We have to avert our eyes at some of the games her brother plays with
her, which involve dragging her around on her stomach on the carpet, or
throwing her sideways onto the couch.  But she cackles wildly with glee and
he’s never hurt her.</p>
<p>The boy has his first “real” bike, with gears and handbrakes and so on.
We’ve been venturing out on some more lengthy expeditions, which is an
outstanding way to see—I mean really <em>look at</em>—pieces of the city that
you otherwise wouldn’t.  I recommend it.</p>
<p>Our
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/08/17/Tab-Sweep-World#p-1">civic-workers’
strike</a> has been going on, it seems, forever.  Thus, the summer session of my
<a href="http://www.drumming.ca/">drumming classes</a> couldn’t meet indoors,
which turned out to be a blessing, because those eight Thursday evenings were
reasonably clear and warm, so we played outside, in
<a href="http://vancouver.ca/parkfinder_wa/index.cfm?fuseaction=FAC.ParkDetails&amp;park_id=181">Strathcona
Park</a>; drums always sound better outside.  I brought the boy along, with
his new bike, to zoom around the park and listen to the drums, one day when
Lauren and the girl were away.  He liked it so much he came back for a bunch
more classes.</p>
<img src="IMG_0447.jpg" alt="Sun through cloud in Strathcona park" />
<p>So, I’m dedicated to the proposition that making the Net better is a good
thing, for me personally because I live there, for the world in general, and
for me again personally because of those Sun stock options, whose value is strongly
Net-linked.</p>
<p>But there’s evidence on my side. A couple of weeks ago I got an email out
of the blue, from which I quote: “Of course Leonard Cohen.  A common taste for
those growing up at that time in Beirut ... And, does your mother still bake
fresh bread?”  It was a one-time sweetheart; my first, in fact.  I haven’t
seen her for thirty-four (34!) years.  We’ve been conversing by email: what we 
remember about then, and her ideas about a new business, and what we’ve been
through in the interim.</p>
<p>More evidence, were any needed, that the Net is, on balance, a very good
thing.</p>

<p>On many-core, wasted cores, threads, processes, transactional memory, and
the E-word.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Are Eight Cores Six Too Many?</h2>
<p>Sun’s latest silicon, the
<a href="http://www.sun.com/processors/UltraSPARC-T2/">T2</a>, has eight
cores, and a memory/thread architecture that, benchmarks suggest, can keep ’em
all pumping.  Well, so what?  Jeff Atwood, in
<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000942.html">Choosing Dual
or Quad Core</a>, shows that for a whole lot of apps, anything more than 
<em>two</em> cores seems a waste.</p>
<p>It’s actually not a short-term crisis.  There are plenty of Web workloads
that naturally run wide rather than hot, whether you’re talking Java EE
wrangling a thread pool or Apache in front of a bunch of LAMPware,
PHP or 
Rails or whatever; plenty of work to soak up about as many T2’s as we can build, I’d bet.
We haven’t had any trouble selling the less-muscular T1.</p>
<p>But I, and a lot of other people, would like to make more code run better
on the new, wider, CPUs.  As Jeff points out, 
“Unfortunately, CPU parallelism is inevitable. Clock speed can’t increase
forever; the physics don’t work. Mindlessly ramping clock speed to 10 GHz
isn’t an option.”</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Transactional Magic Bullet?</h2>
<p>In related news, it’s now public that the next wave of SPARCs 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/08/21/sun_transactional_memory_rock/">will
have hardware transactional memory</a>.</p>
<p>So, is transactional memory, as in Rock, a magic bullet?  <i>[Heh; as I
write this, the Wikipedia article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactional_memory">Transactional memory</a> redirects to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory">Software
transactional memory</a>.  Not for long.]</i>  Everyone knows that
heavily-threaded apps are 
often lock-bottlenecked,  and transactional memory is a good way to do a whole
lot less locking.
Well, for the vast majority of programmers,
Rock’s TM will be invisible; it operates in a very specific and kinda spooky
way down at the instruction-set level.  You’re just <em>not</em> gonna be
wiring it into your cool new Web 2.0 app.  Directly at least.</p>
<p>Where this kind of thing will be useful is down in the guts of core
software infrastructure, stuff that gets as close to the metal as it wants.
For example, the Java VM.</p>
<p>But Java is still thread-centric, and for really getting the most out of
systems that are increasingly going to be many clustered boxes each with many
fast-switching threads, you need to abstract away from that; to quote
<a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/2007/08/25/Lean-Languages-and-Libraries">Sam
Ruby</a>, you need a Virtual Machine that is “designed from the ground up
assuming that objects typically are immutable and serializable”.</p>

<p>I smell a lot of interest but no consensus.
I personally don’t think we’ll all be writing Erlang next year; pardon me for
being old-fashioned, but I think that the human mind naturally thinks of
solving problems along the lines “First you do this, then you do that” and
thinks that Variables are naturally, you know, variable, and has grown 
comfortable with
living in a world of classes and objects and methods.</p>
<p>My bet is that someone figures out how to apply Erlang thinking in a
mainstream coding context and starts a landslide, because everything just
starts running faster and reasonably cool, too.  Then more cores are
unambiguously better, if you can 
swing the memory bandwidth.  And Transactional Memory?  Seems like just
the thing, at the core of such an infrastructure.</p>

<title>Subscribing to Music</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Like a whole lot of people who care about music and the Net, I read the
recent <cite>Times Magazine</cite> piece 
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/magazine/02rubin.t.html">The Music
Man</a>, about how Rick Rubin is trying to save a big piece of the
Music-Biz-That-Was, in part by (gasp!) increasing product quality.
He also talks about moving from away from a ship-the-disks model to a
subscription-based business (this starts about halfway down
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/magazine/02rubin.t.html?pagewanted=5&amp;_r=1">page
5</a> of the piece).  John Gruber
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/september#mon-03-subs">scoffs
at the idea</a>.  I think they’re both wrong; but that subscriptions will be a
big deal.</p>
<p>Rubin envisions a model where you subscribe to the whole
universe of music for say $20/month, and all the labels have to agree on how to
carve up the business.  John argues that this would imply DRM,
because you could sign up for a month, download everything, unsubscribe, and
(although John doesn’t suggest this) publish it on a server in Russia.</p>
<p>That’s a straw man, though, because Rubin’s idea almost entirely misses the
mark.  I don’t want to subscribe to the universe, I want to subscribe to a few
individual artists, and maybe a particular DJ’s selections, or maybe an
affinity group.</p>
<p>And given that, there’s the possibility for spending less money on music
(little enough that it’s just not worthwhile stealing) while
routing more to the artists.
I wrote this up at length in my late-2005 piece 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/12/29/Selling-Art">On Selling Art</a>, and I
haven’t seen anything since then to make me change my mind.</p>

<title>Postmodern Litigation</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Well, it’s all over the news; we and NetApp are in court.  Blecch.
There is one interesting side-note in this dreary story, a first I suspect:
NetApp’s CEO provided color commentary on his blog (no linkage from me
to bloggers who are suing us).  And then later on today, on our official PR
blog, appears 
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/ontherecord/entry/sun_statement_re_netapp_lawsuit">Sun response to NetApp lawsuit</a>
which says, more or less, “In yo face”.  Now, I guess, it’s over to the
lawyers.
<i>[Update: As of now, I’m rejecting all comments on this one.  There were a
pile in the in-basket this morning, and a couple were entirely inappropriate
in a matter involving litigation, and I suddenly became uncomfortable trying
to make judgment calls.  So, sorry, but let’s just leave this.]</i>
<br/>
<i>[Update: I think Bryan Cantrill’s
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/bmc/entry/dtrace_on_ontap">DTrace on ONTAP?</a>
deserves a link, since Bryan was one of the guys who built

<title>The Baby and the Balloon</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>At
<a href="http://www.choicesmarket.com/">the grocery store</a> where we shop
once or twice every week, they always have helium balloons at the cashiers,
and any kids going through get offered one.  Which leads to a
parenting-strategies dilemma and a funny story.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>What Would a Good Parent Do?</h2>
<p>The baby (well, 15-month-old almost-toddler) totally loves the balloons;
pulling them down and letting them up, but most of all squeezing them with
both arms and all ten fingers.  She has sharp little fingernails and it’s
almost inevitable one’s going to go off in her face.  In fact, when she puts
the squeeze on, her eight-year-old brother shrieks and hides his face, he
can’t bear to watch.</p>
<p>When, inevitably, the balloon pops, she’s totally going to have major
hysterics (we hope no actual personality damage).  But she enjoys
it so much, and eventually she has to learn that Shit Happens.  So for now,
we’re letting her molest the balloons.  Would a Good Parent protect her from
the predictable explosion?</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Blues Balloons</h2>
<p>Quite a few years back, when Lauren was out of town, I and the boy, then a
teeny tiny toddler, went off to the
<a href="http://www.burnabybluesfestival.com/">Burnaby Blues Festival</a>, and
we had a good time, except for The Balloon Incident.</p>
<p>What happened was, he
got a helium balloon, and I knew he’d lose it so I wanted to tie it to his
overalls, and he would Rather Die Under Torture than have the balloon tied to
him.  I tried reason (hah!), I tried brute force (he resorted to extreme
squirming) and eventually I got tired of abusing a three-year-old in front of
thousands of strangers and let him just hold it.  Thirty seconds later, it was
drifting up into the blues-laden blue sky.</p>
<p>Thirty-one seconds later, the loud
electric blues were drowned out by the louder toddler meltdown.  There are
times when you gotta tough it out.  Then this nice matronly woman bounced up and
said “Did that adorable little boy lose his balloon?  Here, he can have mine!”
She shrank away horrified as my eyes with terrible clarity told her to implode
and die; then decided that I couldn’t have meant what my eyes said, and anyway
if that boy had a psychopathic Dad maybe she could brighten his world a bit
with a nice purple helium balloon.</p>
<p>Fortunately, at that point he also had stranger anxiety and shrank away
from the Strange Person With a Balloon, offering a first-rate theatrical
shudder no less; doubtless she was moments from diagnosing child abuse and
calling 911, so I steered the boy behind the nearest thicket of hippies,
bringing us in sight of an ice-cream stand, and the problem was over.</p>

<title>Following the OOXML Story</title>

<p>From the beginning of the story up to last week’s crucial vote, it seemed
that
<a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/">Andy Updegrove’s

the best place to follow this story.  I think that as of now, the man to
read would be
<a href="http://www.adjb.net/index.php">Alex Brown</a>; in particular, check
out his authoritative

Berlind’s

<title>Stopping Terror</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Today, the anniversary of 9/11
(here’s <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2001/09/14/2001-09-11">my 9/14/2001
take</a>), the media and the
Net are full of look-backs, appropriately.  I’d like to invest a moment in
thinking about the bad guys and how we’re doing at preventing a re-run.</p>
<p>It seems to me that for terrorists to attack us successfully, they need
three things:  First, money for the mechanics.  Second, street cred, so they
don’t get turned over to law enforcement. Third, a place to hide.
So if you want to fight them, what you want to do is cut off their money,
water down their street cred, and turn their hiding places inside out.
Direct military action?  Sure, but applied against insurgents, it just hasn’t
worked very often.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The 9/11 Guys</h2>
<p>They
were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahhabi">Wahhabis</a>; a specifically
Saudi-Arabian branch of Sunni Islam so extreme as to seem insane to
non-adherents. 
It is now a wealthy and powerful branch because the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Saud">al-Saud family</a> cut it
a bargain: we’ll make you the state religion and pump you full of money and
influence, and all you have to do is promise never to criticize our corrupt
absolute monarchy.</p>
<p>The organization behind the 9/11 guys earned its street cred resisting the
corrupt, brutal, and incompetent Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>After the Soviets left, Afghanistan became their safe haven.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>How Are We Doing?</h2>
<p>If we were going to cut off this specific group’s money, the best
thing to do would be to disrupt the Saudi-Wahhabi devil’s bargain.  Nope; last
time I checked, the Saudi monarchy was still “good friends” with the West.
The good 
news is that the al-Sauds can’t possibly last much longer.  The bad news is
that what replaces them might be worse; hey, it happened in Iraq.</p>
<p>If we were going to dilute the street cred, the thing would be to put an
end to the practice of brutal invasions of Muslim countries by Western
powers.  Nope; while the idea of knocking out Saddam’s tyranny looked smart at
the time (to me, anyhow), we
<a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.org/">screwed it up</a> so badly that
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/10_09_07_iraqpollaug2007_full.pdf">a recent BBC poll
(PDF)</a>
shows (see Question 23) that 57% of the population generally approves of
attacks on coalition forces.  Can you say “breeding terrorists?”</p>
<p>We know that our side’s guys in Iraq are genuinely trying to accomplish
something good, unlike the Soviets in Afghanistan; but the people in the
middle of the maelstrom may be too close to get perspective.</p>
<p>Finally, as to a place to hide.  Afghanistan pretty well shut down; check.
Pakistan?  Well, Gen. Musharraf is another one of those <em>friendly</em>
tyrants.
Actually, I suspect the hiding place is the hardest of terrorism’s three legs
to attack.  But the lameness of our approach on the money and motivation
fronts makes me want to scream.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Six Years Later</h2>
<p>Now Usama’s speechwriters have him talking about Noam
bloody Chomsky and the Caliphate-to-be’s enlightened tax regime.
We can’t shake our addiction to Saudi oil or our habit of propping up
dictators, and although no Western power has ever achieved a good result by
sending soldiers to the Middle East, we don’t seem capable of either learning
how to do it right, or giving up the practice.</p>
<p>We’re just not doing a very good job on the preventing-a-rerun front.</p>

<p>In this issue: P-languages, operating systems, projecting, URIs, and
online medical resources.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Web-friendly PubMed</h2>
<p>Anyone who’s tried any online medical research knows about PubMed, which
will go as deep as your search skills and subject domain expertise will allow.
Historically, it’s been kind of Web-unfriendly, tough to bookmark and share
good results.  The
<a href="http://view.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">NCBI Resource Locator</a> looks like a
real step forward.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>PHP &amp; WS-*, Sitting in a Tree</h2>

<a href="http://www.bloglines.com/blog/sanjiva?id=239">PHP Web services</a>:

including security and reliability”.  I will restrain my urge to editorialize,
but, hey
<a href="http://railsenvy.com/">Rails Envy</a> guys: low-hanging-fruit
alert.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Things Pythonic</h2>
<p>Bruce Eckel has been thinking about loud about Python.  First, in
<a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=214112">Python 3K
or Python 2.9?</a> he’s mildly critical of some of the Python 3K design
choices.  The big issue, of course, is concurrency, nothing new to readers of
this space.</p>
<p>Bruce zeroes in a couple of days later with
<a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=214303">Parallel
Python</a>, a discussion of an interesting library by Vitalii Vanovschi.  It
looks like a classic HPC/grid style server; my own
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/05/24/On-Grids">On Grids</a> has a <em>whole
lot</em> of context around this kind of thing.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Video Out</h2>
<p>Ooooh!  Joey Shen’s
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/joeys/entry/nvidia_solaris_driver">Get your
Solaris Laptop projected</a> has screenshots from a recent NVIDIA driver,
allowing you to configure your outboard screen (or projector).  While this is
admittedly only almost as good as what OS X had five years ago, it’s a whole
lot better than I’ve seen on any Solaris or GNU/Linux box before. (I assume
that if it’s available for Solaris, it’s there for GNU/Linux too?)  I’ve been
saying for a while now that one of the things that keeps me from migrating off
OS X is that the outboard display Has To Just Work.  Maybe we’re getting

Debian.  It’s being worked on here:
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/sch/entry/pkg_1_a_no_scripting">pkg(1): a no scripting zone</a>.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>URI Wrangling</h2>
<p>You know, Uniform Resource Identifiers are at the core of the Web, and have
been around for fifteen years now; you’d think popular programming languages
would have nailed the APIs down.  Oddly, this has long been a weak spot for
Java; I note there’s a new <code>UriBuilder</code> class coming along; see

Hells Angels links getting shot: “A high-speed car chase in a quiet east Langley neighborhood Tuesday ended with a black Hummer in a ditch and a spray of gunfire in a gang-style shooting just a few hundred meters from two schools.”</p>
<p>Now, in Vancouver, bikers shooting 
other bikers is hardly a surprising news story.  And after all, the guy wasn’t
killed, and the fourteen-year-old son he was driving to school wasn’t hurt.
What I found interesting was that the portrait of the victim, and another

<p>Piles of junk, I say.  Pardon me, but I’m feeling grumpy.  After much
more work than it should have been,
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Software#p-5">mod_atom</a> is now generating reasonably
coherent (not done yet, but getting there) HTML output and human-oriented
(as opposed to APP-oriented) Atom feeds.  
It’s slightly idiosyncratic XML, with lots of namespace prefixes.
The <a href="http://feedvalidator.org/">Feed Validator</a> says it’s OK and I
think it’s OK.  But
<em>none of</em> NetNewsWire or Vienna or Bloglines 
<i>[Update: or Blogbridge or Safari, or My Yahoo!, or Sage]</i> 
can read it correctly.  I fart in their general direction.
<i>[Update:

[Ah, Brent sent me a pointer to the latest beta of

3.1, and it’s fine.
I know other people rave about GoogleReader and Vienna
and so on, but for me NNW is still way ahead of the pack in letting me scan a
whole lot of news in almost no time at all.]</i>
Are there any other feed-reader implementors out there who think they can, you
know, <em>read XML correctly</em>?!?! If so, get in touch, and if you process my
little bundle of joy properly, I’ll lavish praise and links.  Or if there’s a
bug in the feed that neither I nor the validator can see, I’ll apologize
humbly to the whole world.  In any case, I’m going to have to go back and
patch up the code so it doesn’t emit any of those nasty colons and relative
URI references that apparently hurt implementors’ fragile feelings.  This does
not improve my mood.

recall that it has all sorts of navigation magic.  But then I thought about
NetBeans’ excellent “Navigator” tool, and that there’s supposed to be some new
C-support code.  So I installed it and it kind of works.</p>
<img src="NB-navigator.jpg" class="inline" alt="the NetBeans navigator on C code" />
<p>The Navigator was immensely helpful. It’s not perfect; for example, (see the
little picture on the right) it has separate entries for functions
and their forward declarations.</p>
<p>The indentation engine needs a few more features; I can’t quite make the code
follow the Apache standards.</p>
<p>There’s not much refactoring there yet but, given what they’ve already got,
I can’t see “Find Usages” and friends being that far away.
And the autocomplete is already in pretty good shape.</p>
<p>It was awfully nice that when I opened up the files, they came with
colour-coding to show the SVN status; I hadn’t even thought of that.</p>
<p>Overall, the pre-beta NB6 C support is perfectly competent and gets out
of the way; I’m going faster than I was in Emacs.  Heh, I’ve also filed five
or ten bugs and RFEs in my first day of using the thing.</p>
<p>For those of us who have to spend time in the C mines, NetBeans
6 is going to be a Very Good Thing.</p>
<p>I suppose a piece like this isn’t complete without a screenshot; looks
about like you’d expect a C IDE to.</p>
<img src="NB-C-screenshot.jpg" alt="NetBeans 6 C support screenshot" />
<p>Heh; note that the error message for <code>ap_log_error</code> is
<em>completely</em> wrong; first of all this is PUT not POST, and it’s “save”
not “same”.</p>

<title>Autumnal mod_atom</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I just did a massive check-in on
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Software#p-5">mod_atom</a>, and
it’s now not just an Atom Store, it’s also a basic blog publisher.  This
fragment is about how it works, and includes a confession; I did one fairly
awful thing along the way.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Still CoC</h2>
<p>There’s still almost no configuration; just one directive, like so:</p>
<pre><code>AtomPub /base/publication/URI /base/pub/dir "Pub Title" "Pub Author"</code></pre>
<p>I keep thinking of places where configuration options would be useful, but
then there’d need to be a configuration syntax and a place to put them, and
it’s so easy to make a mistake there that you’ll have to live with for a long,
long time.  So I’m going to hold the line on more config stuff, for the
moment.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Making HTML: What?</h2>
<p>As of now, if you POST (or PUT) an Atom Entry to a mod_atom collection that
accepts them, it’ll generate an HTML version <em>if</em> the entry’s
<code>content</code> element has a <code>type</code> value of
<code>text</code> or <code>html</code> or <code>xhtml</code>.</p>
<p>Whenever one of the HTML pages gets created or updated, mod_atom updates
the publication’s “Front page” and a public-facing Atom feed for the
publication.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Making HTML: How?</h2>
<p>How, you might ask, does that HTML get created?  Well, here’s the
confession: I ended up inventing another HTML templating language.  Because
the Web doesn’t have enough.  Here’s the current default template for the
per-entry pages.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;html xmlns:m='http://www.mod-atom.net/ns'>
&lt;head>
&lt;title>&lt;m:title />&lt;/title>
&lt;m:entry-stylesheet />
&lt;m:entry-script />
&lt;m:generator />
&lt;/head>
&lt;body class='atom-body'>
&lt;m:logo />
&lt;h2>&lt;m:title />&lt;/h2>
&lt;div class='atom-authors'>
&lt;m:entry-author />
&lt;m:contributors />
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class='atom-content'>
&lt;m:content />
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class='atom-cats'>
&lt;m:cats />
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class='atom-rights'>
&lt;m:rights />
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class='atom-dates'>
&lt;m:published />
&lt;m:updated />
&lt;/div>
&lt;/body>
&lt;/html></code></pre>
<p>This template never gets applied at run-time, only at POST or PUT time.
There’s really quite a lot of scope for customization.  Also, those
<code>entry-stylesheet</code> and <code>entry-script</code> template fields
generate something that look like:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;link href="/foo/bar/pub/e/entries/atom-entry.css" rel="stylesheet">&lt;/link>
&lt;script src="/foo/bar/pub/e/entries/atom-entry.js" type="text/javascript">&lt;/script></code></pre>
<p>That, together with all those class attributes, ought to give you enough
hooks to build as widget-packed and AJAXerrific a twenty-first century HTML
page as anyone could want.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Sanitation</h2>
<p>Earlier on, I had a bunch of HTML
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/08/09/Sanitation">sanitation</a> code that
was applied to incoming POSTs and PUTs.  I ripped it out again, so the
Atom-store part of mod_atom screws with the incoming data as little as
possible.  But all that sanitation code does get applied to anything that
comes out of the HTMLification process.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Does It Work?</h2>
<p>Well, it passes the Ape test suite running on OS X and Debian.  The HTML
Entry and Front pages look OK, and while the public-facing feed
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/14/Lousy-Aggregators">has some
problems</a> (and is a first-rate
<a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/2007/09/15/One-More-Step-Forward#c1189960923">conversation
piece</a>),
it’s a start.</p>
<p>There are
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/mod-atom/issues/list">issues</a>, of course,
and if anyone starts using this, there’ll be lots more.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>To Do</h2>
<p>There are two big missing <em>functional</em> pieces. First off, it needs
to be easy to turn off all this HTML stuff so mod_atom is a pure Atom Store.
Second, it doesn’t support <code>app:draft</code>, and if it got much out into
the wild in that state, Joe Cheng would send a poison dwarf from Redmond to
strangle my cats.  And it’s easy enough to add, so I will.</p>

<p>It’s
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/theaquarium/entry/glassfish_v2_launch_roundup">out
today</a>.  Now, I don’t work with app servers that much, and I’ve hardly ever
touched GlassFish.  But this is interesting anyhow, for two reasons: First,
GlassFish is an example of a software product that was struggling in the
market, and is doing immensely better after moving from closed to Open Source.
Smells like the future to me.
Second, check out that launch pointer: a blog
cluster, with the marketing basics and a ton of highly-technical detail.  I
just don’t think there’s any other sensible way to launch a modern
software package whose users are developers.</p>

<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/02/Labour-Day-Weekend">long-weekend
shift</a> with Pete Lacey and Sam Ruby and I, pounding WP2.3’s APP-server code
into shape.  He has written
<a href="http://joseph.randomnetworks.com/archives/2007/09/19/http-basic-authentication-a-tale-of-atompub-wordpress-php-apache-cgi-and-ssltls/">HTTP Basic Authentication, A Tale of AtomPub, WordPress, PHP, Apache, CGI and SSL/TLS</a>;
the title is appropriately long, as this is a <em>very</em> meaty piece that I
bet will be read many times in the near to medium future by someone puzzled
and frustrated by some combination of Apache, PHP, and authentication
requirements.  Well, yes, the problems popped up in the context of Atompub and
WordPress, but there’s nothing specific to the protocol or the product; it’s a
big messy ugly corner of Web technology.</p>
<p>Further Atom news: It seems like a new APP implementation drifts across my
radar every week.

<title>The Wide Finder Project</title>

<body>
<p>In my <cite>Finding Things</cite> chapter of
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596510046/">Beautiful Code</a>,
the first complete program is a little Ruby script that reads the <span class='o'>ongoing</span>
Apache logfile and figures out which articles have been fetched the most.
It’s a classic example of the culture, born in Awk, perfected in Perl, of
getting useful work done by combining regular expressions and hash tables.
I want to figure out how to write an equivalent program that runs fast on
modern CPUs with low clock rates but many cores; this is the Wide Finder
project.</p>

<p>It’s already obvious that Web-oriented frameworks in general, and Java EE
in particular, run like a bat out of hell on processors like our Niagara boxes
and especially the systems that will be built around the new
<a href="http://www.sun.com/processors/UltraSPARC-T2/">T2</a>.</p>
<p>But you know, there’s lots of interesting computing that doesn’t happen in
Web frameworks. 
Like, for example, logfile processing.
And since more and more computers are going to start looking
more and more like our Niagara-family boxes, we’re going to need to figure out
how to get this kind of basic unglamorous essential job to run fast on them.</p>
<p>Whatever it is we use to write the many-core-friendly Intergalactic P2P
Adaptive Semantic Web4.0 killer apps of the future, well, it has to be a
<em>general-purpose</em> programming language, because they always win.  Which
means it has to have a good way to read a logfile and compute the most popular
fetches.  You might argue that this program is kind of heavy on I/O
and text processing.  That’s correct; but so is computing in general.</p>
<p>For reference, here’s the little Ruby program:</p>
<pre><code>counts = {}
counts.default = 0

ARGF.each_line do |line|
  if line =~ %r{GET /ongoing/When/\d\d\dx/(\d\d\d\d/\d\d/\d\d/[^ .]+) }
    counts[$1] += 1
  end
end

keys_by_count = counts.keys.sort { |a, b| counts[b] &lt;=> counts[a] }
keys_by_count[0 .. 9].each do |key|
  puts "#{counts[key]}: #{key}"
end</code></pre>
<p>Several have pointed out that I should have used <code>sort_by</code> at
the bottom.  Whatever.</p>
<p>It took this code 7½ seconds of CPU, 13½ seconds elapsed, to process a
million and change records, a quarter-gig or so, on last year’s 1.67Ghz
PowerBook.  A Perl version was approximately twice as fast.</p>
<p>What I’m looking for is something that’s approximately as compact and
readable, and runs many times faster on a modern many-core meat-grinder.
Should be fun.</p>

<title>WF I: Erlang Ho!</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is the first progress report from the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/20/Wide-Finder">Wide Finder Project</a>.
Erlang is the obvious candidate for a Wide Finder implementation.  It may be
decades old but it’s the new hotness, it’s got a
<a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/jaerlang/">PragBook</a> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/193435600X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=anyway-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=193435600X">@Amazon</a>), 
I hear heavy breathing from serious software geeks whichever way I listen.
So, let’s give it a whirl.  <i>[Warning: Long and
detailed, but the conclusion comes first.]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Based on a few days’ bashing, I think that if I were
starting out on a networked application that needed to run well on many-core
systems and I wanted to be really <em>really</em> sure would never go
down, Erlang might be just the ticket.</p>
<p>But as for the Wide Finder problem: Erlang, as it ships today, doesn’t work.
It’s got slow-ish file I/O and ridiculously, unusably slow regular
expression processing.  There may be work-arounds.</p> 
<h2 id='p-2'>Leaping In</h2> 
<p>Joe Armstrong’s book is no Camel or Pickaxe, but it’s OK.  Armstrong tends
to lead with theory, introducing the language formalisms <em>then</em> showing
how you might use them.  
The coverage is a little thin; there are lots of big
important pieces of the library that are entirely bypassed, and lots of
omitted pieces in those that are covered.  Whatever; if you’re an experienced
programmer, you’ll be able to to use this as a bootstrap, and there are 
decent resources online.</p>
<p>I raised my eyebrows a bit at the near-complete absence of any discussion
of text processing, regular expressions, and so on.  Also at Erlang’s quaint
notions about strings and characters; see Sam Ruby’s
<a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/2007/09/14/ASCII-ISO-8859-1-UCS-and-Erlang">ASCII, ISO-8859-1, UCS, and Erlang</a>.
Well, the language reflects the book.</p>
<p>The rest of this piece is basically my working notes from the last few
days’ work.
I’m sure the source-code snippets will make real Erlang experts blanch in
horror.  That’s OK, I’m probably reasonably typical of an experienced
developer picking this stuff up, so my goofs are likely usefully diagnostic.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Looping</h2>
<p>Erlang doesn’t want to; it wants you to use tail-recursion instead.  Here’s
how I process all the lines out of a file:</p>
<pre><code>scan_line(io:get_line(File, ''), File, Pattern, Counter).

scan_line(eof, _, _, _) -> 0;
scan_line(Line, File, Pattern, Counter) ->
    process_match(Line, regexp:match(Line, Pattern), Counter),
    scan_line(io:get_line(File, ''), File, Pattern, Counter).</code></pre>
<p>I suppose this is OK, except for the tail recursion is really 
a glorified <code>goto</code> statement, and after a while it starts to
feel like an elaborate fake-recursive lie.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Counting</h2>
<p>In most computer languages, the way you count things is by incrementing a
variable.  In the Ruby program that the Wide Finders are trying to replicate,
it’s like this:</p>
<pre><code>    counts[$1] += 1</code></pre>
<p>Except for, in Erlang, Variables aren’t variable, so you Can’t Do That.
I thought of two ways to count things.  Every Erlang process has a process
dictionary, i.e. a hashtable or content-addressable store or whatever, with
<code>get()</code> and <code>put()</code> calls.  This is the kind of thing
that the Ruby code above depends on; the square brackets are a dictionary
lookup. 
The problem is, Joe Armstrong severely disses the use
of the dictionary; you get the idea that if you use it, you’re the kind of
person who sniffs little girls’ bicycle seats for thrills.</p>
<p>There’s also a hashtable package called <code>ets</code>, of which Joe
expresses less disapproval.</p>
<p>Another way to count things, which I suspect would make Erlinguists
happier, is to spawn a process for each thing you need to count, containing code
like so:</p>
<pre><code>counter_loop(Count) ->
    receive
	{ incr } ->
	    counter_loop(Count + 1);
	{ report, To } ->
	    To ! { count, Count },
	    counter_loop(Count)
    end.</code></pre>
<p>Then you talk to it with code like this:</p>
<pre><code>incr(Counter) ->
    Counter ! { incr }.

find_count(Counter) ->
    Counter ! { report, self() },
    receive
	{ count, Count } ->
	    Count
    end.</code></pre>
<p>In my logfile, there is a small number of thousands of unique URIs to
count, and the Erlang posse loves chest-beating about their process mojo, so
this may be a good fit.  Of course, you need some extra infrastructure to
spawn the counter processes and map each unique URI to the process that’s
counting it, but I built that and it seems to work OK.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Performance</h2>
<p>Reviewing: that little Ruby program could process a week’s worth of data,
a million and change lines, maybe a quarter of a gig, in about 7½ seconds of
CPU, 13½ seconds elapsed.  Perl was about twice as fast.</p>
<p>My first cut in Erlang, based on the per-process dictionary, took around
<em>eight minutes</em> of CPU, and kept one of my MacBook’s Core Duo
processors pegged at 97% while it was running.  Ouch!</p>
<p>Switching to the <code>ets</code> version made no difference, nor did
switching to my lightweight multi-process counter as illustrated above.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Profiling</h2>
<p>Erlang comes with no less than three profilers, fairly thinly documented.
I ended up using something called <em>fprof</em>.  It’s a pig.
I put it to work on a 100K-line subset of the test data, and it ground my
computer to a halt and exhibited no progress in ten minutes, I killed that and
started again with a 10K-line (2M of data) subset.  It was still pretty bad;
then I noticed that the profile trace was up over 8G in size and growing fast.
So I tried again on only a thousand lines (195K), and the profile data was a
mere 900M.</p>
<p>Eventually, the profiler revealed the awful truth: my program was spending
90% of its time in <code>regexp:match</code> and another 9% in
<code>io:get_line</code>.  I put my amazing powers of deduction to work and
considered the hypothesis that Erlang regular expressions are slow.  I had
previously noticed this comment in the implementation:</p>
<pre><code>%% Note that we interpret the syntax tree of a regular expression
%% directly instead of converting it to an NFA and then interpreting
%% that. This method seems to go significantly faster.</code></pre>
<p>Well, a single-digit number of seconds with Google turned up lots of
evidence, as for example from Gaspar Chilingarov in
<a href="http://zanazan.am/erlang/re.html">Implementatoin of regular
expressions in pure Erlang</a> <i>[sic]</i>: “In you tried to use regexp
module from base erlang distribution or gregexp from jungerl, you noticed,
that they work quite slow and are not usable to real text extraction
tasks.”</p>
<p>There are alternatives: Gaspar, quoted above, provides one, and there has
been
<a href="http://www.erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2006-August/022596.html">at
least one</a> interface to the Posix regex libraries.</p>
<p>So I’ll check these out, because I’d really like to get past this basic
stuff and investigate whether, as seems likely, I can get past Erlang’s
reluctance to read, parse, and count, and make use of its allegedly-excellent concurrency.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>Postscript</h2>
<p>And I should say: I’ve really enjoyed having to learn a new way to think
about computer programming.</p>

<title>The Rubinius Sprint</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last week in Denver, the
<a href="http://rubini.us/">Rubinius</a> guys had a coding sprint; read about
it in Brian Ford’s
<a href="http://blog.brightredglow.com/2007/9/17/rubinius-sprint-retrospective">Rubinius sprint retrospective</a>
and Wilson Bilkovich’s
<a href="http://metaclass.org/2007/9/18/define-method">Implementing
define_method</a>.  We at Sun supported it by covering the travel costs (well,
we will as soon as I get the paperwork, guys) and by sending Charles Nutter
along for a day.  Looks like they got some good stuff done.  Rubinius is an
attempt to build the next-gen Ruby implementation.  Which is happening in
parallel with the “official” Ruby 1.9 work in Japan and the JRuby project.
<i>[Update:
<a href="http://on-ruby.blogspot.com/2007/09/rubinius-sprint-interview.html">Pat Eyler 
interviews the sprinters</a>.]</i></p>
<p>Basically, we’re supporting all of them.  Along with giving Rubinius a
hand, we employ half the JRuby committers, we’ve donated a server to Matz’s
gang, and (I hope to be able to announce soon) we’re going to be giving the
Japanese side some other support.</p>
<p>Why are we doing this?  Because, in my view, Ruby isn’t finished.  It’s a
great substrate for Rails, it’s immensely useful for building all sorts of
things, but it’s <em>not fast enough</em>.  I agree with Avi Bryant’s argument
that a language isn’t finished until it’s fast enough to extend itself.
Frankly, none of the language enhancements proposed for Ruby 2.0 make my heart
go pitter-patter.  But give me a Ruby with performance as good as a really
good Smalltalk VM, and the space of things for which you need 
statically-typed languages shrinks to a really uninteresting size.</p>
<p>Except for, nobody including me is smart enough to predict which of the
Ruby.next implementations is going to have that performance mojo.  So, it
seems like the only reasonable thing is to bet on all of ’em.  One thing that
makes this easy is that all the teams get along with each other; a natural
outgrowth of Ruby culture, and something from which we can all learn.</p>

<title>WF II: Erlang Blues</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is the second progress report from the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/20/Wide-Finder">Wide Finder Project</a>,
and a follow-on from the first,
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/21/Erlang">Erlang Ho!</a>  The one thing
that Erlang does right is so important that I’d like to get past its
problems. So far I can’t.</p>
<p><i>[Update: Several people wrote “show me the data!”  Well, OK then.  
Ten thousand lines of
logfile, a little over two meg, may be found at
<code>www.tbray.org/tmp/o10k.ap</code>.  Anyone who can generate Erlang code
that can read this stuff and parse out the <span class='o'>ongoing</span>
fragment 
fetches at a remotely competitive speed will get me interested in Erlang
again.]
[Update II: See the comments: the problem seems to be <code>io:get_line</code>
(which is a serious problem, by the way).  At
first glance, the solutions
work for the case when you can read the whole file into memory before you
start to process any of it.  Looks like I’ll be spending a bit more quality
time with E.]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Interactive Irritation</h2>
<p>If you type <code>erl</code> at your shell prompt, you’re in Erlang.  There
are differences between what you can have in a file and
what you can type at the prompt.  And when you type control-D, nothing
happens; to get out, you have to interrupt it with control-C or
equivalent.  This is wrong.</p>
<p>If you type <code>erlc foo.erl</code> it’ll compile into
<code>foo.beam</code>, but you can’t just type
<code>erl foo.beam</code> to run it, you have to add a bunch of
stupid pettifogging options.  This is wrong.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Slow Basics</h2>
<p>Yesterday, I reported on Erlang’s <em>appalling</em> regexp performance.
Someone using the handle “Masklinn”
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/21/Erlang#c1190452706.452333">suggested</a> using 
pattern-matching with what Erlang calls “binaries” instead.  So I did.  Let’s
leave the add-’em-up part of my problem out, and zero in on the problem of
getting Erlang to read the 1,167,948 lines of logfile and select the 105,099
that are fetches of <span class='o'>ongoing</span> fragments.</p>
<p>I coded it up using patterns per Masklinn’s suggestion and it was really
much better, burning only 56.44 CPU seconds on my MacBook.  The code looks
like this:</p>
<pre><code>process_match(&lt;&lt; "/ongoing/When/", Trailer/binary >>) ->
    Last = binary_to_list(Trailer),
    case lists:member($., Last) of
	true -> 0;
	false -> 1
    end;
process_match(_) -> 0.

scan_line(eof, _, Count) -> Count;
scan_line(Line, File, Count) ->
    Uri = list_to_binary(lists:nth(7, string:tokens(Line, " "))),
    NewCount = Count + process_match(Uri),
    scan_line(io:get_line(File, ''), File, NewCount).</code></pre>
<p>At this point I smelled a rat; in particular, an I/O rat.  So I ripped out
all the fragment-recognition crap and measured how long it takes Erlang to
read the lines:</p>
<pre><code>scan_line(eof, _, Count) -> Count;
scan_line(_, File, Count) ->
    scan_line(io:get_line(File, ''), File, Count + 1).</code></pre>
<p>That was better: a mere 34.165 CPU seconds.</p>
<p>Except for, on the same MacBook, my simple little Ruby program read the
lines, parsed out the fragment fetches, and did all the totaling and sorting
in, let’s see... 3.036 CPU seconds (3.47 seconds elapsed).</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Hold On a Second</h2>
<p>Unlike Ruby, Erlang is highly concurrent.  So if I ran it on an 8-core
machine, the Ruby would run at the same speed, but the Erlang ought to go
faster.  Except for parallelizing line-at-a-time I/O from a file would be
hard.  And even if you could, and go eight times as fast, and even leaving out
all the matching and adding, you’re still half again as slow as Ruby.  This is
wrong.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Dear Erlang I:</h2>
<p>I like you.  Really, I do.  But until you can read lines of text out of a
file and do basic pattern-matching against them acceptably fast (which most
people would say is <em>faster</em> than Ruby), you’re stuck in a niche;
you’re a thought experiment and a consciousness-raiser and an engineering
showpiece, but you’re not a general-purpose tool.  Sorry.</p>
<p>I’m done with beating my head against Erlang for now.  If someone can
show me how to make it read and pattern-match at a remotely competitive speed,
I’ll be able actually to look at that nice concurrency stuff; and I’d like
to.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Dear Erlang II:</h2>
<p>Thank you for helping me think about the Wide Finder problem.  As a result
of these days together, I think I know what the ideal solution 
would look like.  I suspect it’s not out there yet, but I bet I
can recognize it when I see it.  More on that later.</p>

<title>WF III: Lessons</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is the third progress report from the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/20/Wide-Finder">Wide Finder Project</a>.
Given that I launched this brouhaha late on a Friday, totally the worst
possible time, I’m astounded at the intensity and quality of the conversation
that’s going on. I want to address two themes that have emerged,
one of which seems stupid and the other smart.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Wrong Problem?</h2>
<p>There’ve been comments and blogs along the lines of “WTF, trying
to shake down Erlang using what amounts to a degenerate Awk script!!?
This isn’t what Erlang is for!  It’s all just I/O!  Lines of text are so
1980’s!”</p>
<p>Nope; the further this goes, the more I think it’s a valid line of
research.  You know all those kazillions of Sun servers out there?  Let me
tell you, they’re not all running state-of-the-art Java-on-the-net apps.  A huge
proportion of all those cycles goes into Perl scripts and COBOL batches and C++
meat-grinders and FORTRAN number-crunching.  Furthermore, if you look at the
numbers from running my Perl and Ruby scripts, it’s obvious that they’re
pegging both the CPU and I/O needles; so they’re nicely multidimensional in a
simple way.</p>
<p>This is the kind of nasty unglamorous job that a lot of our customers run
all the time to pay their rents, and this whole business is making a big bet
on many-core computers, and it’s just not on to tell all those people that
those are the wrong kind of jobs for the new iron.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Good News</h2>
<p>I first saw this on the 
<a href="http://www.trapexit.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=31894#31894">Erlang
Questions</a> mailing list, from someone whose 
handle was Patrick: “The good news is speeding up the i/o in erlang should be
easier than introducing better concurrency to another language.”  Then there’s
Patrick (the some one?) Logan saying the same thing in
<a href="http://patricklogan.blogspot.com/2007/09/postmodern-io.html">Postmodern I/O</a>.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>In fact, there are practical suggestions on how exactly to do that, from
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/22/Erlang#c1190584602.142246">Clayton
Wheeler</a> and
<a href="http://steve.vinoski.net/blog/2007/09/23/tim-bray-and-erlang/">Steve
Vinoski</a>. (What <em>is</em> he up to at the new startup?).</p>
<p>Not only will I kick the tires, I’ll try the code out on our unreleased
T2-based many-core/many-thread monster.  This is going to be fun.</p>

<title>Flat Rate Considered Harmful</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Lots of people, including for example
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan">my CEO</a>, say that the hand-held
mobile 
is going to be a crucial, maybe a dominant, way for people to
experience the Net; particularly on the other side of what we now call
the digital divide.  Only there’s an economic problem.</p>
<p>I don’t know anyone who’s really satisfied with the quality of the
mobile Net experience; the iPhone seems to be pushing the edge of
tolerable, as long as you’re on WiFi.  But still, where’s the rich menu of
multi-modal multi-media location-sensitive always-on exquisitely-personalized
applications that the hardware and the Net ought to deliver?  Surely
there’s something more interesting than Blackberry-style mail?</p>
<p>Here’s one problem: fixed-rate data plans.  With those, once the telco has
your money they really want you on the network as little as possible;
there’s no incentive to make it run faster or have better apps or lure you
into using it more.  Some of the network operators have this idea that the way
to make money 
is to control the relationship with the customer and extract a piece of unit of
payment that flows through a mobile device.</p> 
<p>The conventional wisdom—and one I buy into—is that businesses ought to focus
on their core competences.  For mobile network operators, those would be
bandwidth and billing.  So, here’s a recipe for blowing up the mobile-network
business and making the world better and also a whole lot of money.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Discontinue all flat-rate mobile data plans.</p></li>
<li><p>Offer a-la-carte data at a price that seems obscenely, ridiculously,
low.</p></li>
<li><p>Radically open up the network.  Let anyone connect anything to it.
Sell phones that make it really easy to download apps from anywhere and run
them.</p></li>
<li><p>Build a developer ecosystem.  Make it effortless to get in.  Build a
hot-new-apps social network; maybe in alliance with one of the big existing
social nets.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t ask developers for any money.  But sell the use of your billing
system at a really attractive rate, so people can sign up for apps and have it
billed to their phone plan.  Do it at a scale that an app can charge a dime a
month and still make money on scale.</p></li>
<li><p>Duck and cover, because the explosion of creativity and new business
models will cause some casualties.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Seems like a no-brainer to me.</p>

<title>SFO Domestic Hints</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>If you do technology, you probably find yourself traveling through SFO,
a.k.a. San Francisco International Airport, regularly.  Here are a couple of
hints.  I don’t go across the ocean from there, so thus these exclude the
international terminal.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Terminal 1</h2>
<p>It’s grubby and dingy and sort of awful.  The airlines working
out of here are mostly second-rate.  The frequent-flyer lounges are bad and
the shopping minimal.  You want to eat <em>outside</em> the security gateways;
there’s a Mexican place about halfway along that’s not too bad.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Terminal 2</h2>
<p>Its vasty echoing halls are currently unused, except for a thin
procession of travelers who went to Terminal 1 when they needed 3, or vice
versa.  Its rather-nice front hall would be improved by the addition of a huge
aggressively-modern conceptual art piece.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Terminal 3</h2>
<p>Not bad.  If you’re on United and are a frequent flyer, there are separate
check-ins and security off to the right.  There
are restaurants and shopping right there where you get through security, by
gates 68-73, and
more at the end of a long moving walkway out to the hub.</p>
<p>The shopping is better at the near end, near security, with an excellent
bookstore, a Palm store where you can try on lots of different Bluetooth
headsets, and so on.  Also at the near end are three
nearly-identical restaurants from Gordon Biersch, Anchor Steam, and one other,
which serve decent beers with horrid flavorless fatty bar-food.
But if there’s a Big Game, it’ll be on the big screen.</p>
<p>Out in the hub there’s an unglamorous but good food-court, I’ve had very
competent sushi and Mexican food.  The shopping out there is souvenirs, but
there’s a Swatch store with an OK selection.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Car Issues</h2>
<p>Have a quick visit to my 2004 piece
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/04/28/SFOnotes">SFO</a>, which has a valuable
driving tip for those of you heading south to the Valley from the airport.</p>
<p>Here’s another tip: when you’ve dropped off your rental, do <em>not</em>,
as they suggest, go all the way down to the bottom, across the sidewalk, and
back up the long escalator to stand waiting in the howling SF Bay
winds.  Just go back to where you got off the train (same floor for
Hertz, up one for Avis) and wait in the comfy enclosed arrival space; when the
train arrives, ignore the stupid sign saying “don’t board here” and get on
after the people get off but before the doors on the other side open,
ignoring the glares from the people lined up over there on the blustery
outdoor platform.</p>

<title>WF IV: The Cascade</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is the fourth progress report from the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/20/Wide-Finder">Wide Finder Project</a>.
Following on my earlier fumbling at the controls of the Erlang race-car,
several others joined the conversation.  For particularly smart input,
check out the
<a href="http://www.trapexit.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=9806&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0">Erlang
questions mailing list</a> and the already-linked-to Steve Vinoski piece,
<a href="http://steve.vinoski.net/blog/2007/09/23/tim-bray-and-erlang/">Tim
Bray and Erlang</a>.  Other voices have questioned the project’s sanity, and
brought Scala and Haskell to bear on the problem.  But let’s push all that on
the stack, and ask ourselves this question: what if processes were
free?  Answering it turns out to be all sorts of fun; I seize the Erlang
controls back again, and steer it with a firm steady hand into a brick wall at
top speed.</p>
<p>Erlang’s proponents claim that processes <em>are</em> free, pretty nearly.  And in fact, Steve
Vinoski’s findings support that claim.  He had the radical idea of
parallelizing not only the counting of totals but the breaking-up of the file
into lines and the pattern matching; which never would have occurred to me.
His algorithm has a single parameter: the number of Erlang processes.  He
observed that the curve dropped off somewhere north of 400.</p>
<p>While I admire Steve’s work, there are three things about it that bothered
me.  First, the ad-hoc recursive binary-match probing to find the line breaks
to split on.  Second, that irritating number-of-processes parameter (as an
application programmer, I really don’t want to think about the number of
processes running my code any more than I want to think of the organization of
the page table that intercepts my memory references).  Finally, the fact that
he had to read the whole file into memory in one unit.  Remember, my logfiles
are a quarter-gig per <em>week</em>, and I have years’ worth of data, so
that’s just not gonna fly.</p>
<p>On the first, Steve was fighting an Erlang shortcoming: there’s a
<code>tokenize</code> function for strings but not for binaries.  Deal with it.</p> 
<h2 id='p-1'>How Many Processes?</h2>
<p>In an ideal many-core world, process creation should be as close to free as
achievable.  The Erlvangelists claim that they get closer to the ideal than
anyone.  In that ideal world, you’d simply assign every conceivable
independent unit of computation to its own process and let the infrastructure
sort out the problems of getting them scheduled appropriately.</p>
<p>The Wide Finder problem has the following independent units of
computation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Breaking chunks of data out of the file into lines.</p></li>
<li><p>Processing each line to establish whether it is an article
fetch.</p></li>
<li><p>Counting fetches for each article.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, let’s assign each of those units to a separate process, and see what
happens.
There’ll be a lot of little processes that do one job, hand off the work, and
exit, in a cascade.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Finding Lines in Blocks</h2>
<p>In an ideal world, you’d split your file up into blocks and hand each
block to a separate process.  There’s a fly in the ointment; the data is
organized into newline-separated “lines”, and they don’t arrange
themselves neatly across block boundaries.</p>
<p>So what you do is, you split the block into lines, you accept that the last
chunk won’t be a complete line, so you pass that on to the next chunk (and of
course you attach the equivalent fragment from the previous line to the front
of this chunk before splitting).</p>
<pre><code>%% The file-chunk cascade
chunk() ->
    receive
	{ Previous, File, Counter, Source } ->
	    %% read one chunk of the file
	    case file:read(File, ?BUFSIZ) of
		{ok, Chunk} ->
		    split_chunk(Previous, Chunk, File, Counter, Source);
		eof -> done
	    end
    end.

%% mostly to avoid excessive indentation
split_chunk(Previous, Chunk, File, Counter, Source) ->

    %% When we split a chunk into lines on \n, the last piece probably 
    %% doesn't end with a newline.  The "Previous" argument is that last
    %% piece from the prior chunk; we stick it on the front, and split
    %% *that* into lines
    LinesPlus = string:tokens(Previous ++ Chunk, "\n"),

    %% subtract the trailing line fragment from the list of lines to process
    Trailer = lists:last(LinesPlus),
    Lines = lists:delete(Trailer, LinesPlus),
    %% io:format("**** Chunk split into ~p lines~n", [length(Lines)]),

    %% a new process for the next chunk
    spawn(fun cascade:chunk/0) ! { Trailer, File, Counter, Source },

    %% a new process for each line in this chunk
    lists:foreach(fun(L) ->
			  spawn(fun cascade:line/0) ! { L, Counter, self() }
		  end, Lines),

    %% wait for all the line processing to be done
    wait_for_lines(length(Lines)),

    %% let the mainline know this chunk is done
    Source ! done.</code></pre>
<p>You have to do the line-splitting to isolate the trailing fragment before
    you can start processing the next block.  But, in a world where processes
    are free, you can start processing the next block (as above) before you
    start processing the lines in this block.
With a block size of 32k, you get on average 150 or so lines from each.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Looking at Lines</h2>
<p>Here’s the line processing.</p>
<pre><code>%% The per-line cascade
line() ->
    receive
	{ Line, Counter, Chunker } ->
	    %% Pull out the URI field
	    Uri = lists:nth(7, string:tokens(Line, " ")),
	    case Uri of

		%% we'll count it if it matches the pattern and doesn't
		%% contain a '.'
		"/ongoing/When" ++ Rest ->
		    case lists:member($., Rest) of

			%% counting is done in another process
			false -> counter:incr(Rest, Counter);
			true -> pass
		    end;
		_ -> done
	    end,

	    %% let the chunk processor know this line is done
	    Chunker ! done
    end.</code></pre>
<p>So each chunk of input data, and each line from the chunk, gets its own
process.  That’s not all.  That <code>counter:incr</code> call turns out to
	    give each unique fetched-article URI its own counter process;
	    details
	    <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/21/Erlang#p-4">here</a>.</p>
<p>To be precise: seven thousand or so block-splitting
    processes, another short-lived process for each of the 1167948 lines,
    and a persistent process for each of the 4706 unique URIs.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>The Results</h2>
<p>First of all, you can get the code: 
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/code/cascade.erl">cascade.erl</a> and
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/code/counter.erl">counter.erl</a>.</p>
<p>This represents, I think, a theoretical maximum in the number of independent
processes we’re throwing at the problem, with only one parameter; how big a
	    chunk of file we read at a time.</p>
<p>How does it run?  Well, like dogshit, more or less. Applied to the whole
	    250M file containing a week’s worth of 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> data, the code burned 55 seconds of CPU.  Which
	    is twenty or more times slower than the naïve Ruby
	    implementation.  Which means we’re not done yet.</p>
<p>Have I profiled it yet?  No.  I will.  And I’m not entirely without hope
	    that this conceptually-pure approach can be made to run <em>really
	    fucking fast</em> in the real world.</p>
<p>But before I buckle down to all that workaday stuff, I wanted to present
	    the processes-are-free thought experiment in its purest form.
Because this stuff is pure brain candy.</p>

<p>This is the fifth progress report from the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/20/Wide-Finder">Wide Finder Project</a>;
an aggregation of what other people have been saying.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Misguided?</h2>
<p>The opinion continues to be heard, here and there, that the project is
misguided; that a well-tuned regexp engine will run at I/O speed or better,
thus the whole thing is I/O bound, and not suitable for speedup via
parallelization.</p>
<p>The numbers I see coming out of the Ruby and Perl versions of the code lead
me to disagree, so I’m going to keep poking around.
And even if this point of view turns out to be right, that in itself would be
a valuable finding: “Typical sequential logfile-processing tasks are not
particularly helped by the use of many-core technologies.”</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Other Approaches</h2>

<p>Vancouver has all four.  Less
intense perhaps than other parts of Canada where the snow extends into April
and spring is life after death; here it’s life after boredom.
It’s a fashionable town, our changes are mostly what we wear.</p>
<p>Since I’m a geek I need something with
pockets always, for the camera and phone and wallet.  In summer it’s a
<a href="http://www.tilley.com/detail.asp?productNo=MA55">Tilley Outback</a>.
In the cold months it’s a leather jacket, once expensive with a famous
Italian name that I’m not gonna drop here, only I had the lining and
internal pockets replaced because there weren’t enough, and the outside is
beat up and 
looks way better than new.  In months between, a thin no-label black
department-store synthetic jacket that I like best of all because its entire
lack of any  sensibility whatever seems its own statement: you have to look at
my face.</p> 
<p>Today I took the baby in the stroller to
the butcher, buying beef for Sunday’s dinner guests. I had to wear
the leather, hence the title.</p>

<title>WF VI: The Goal</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is the sixth progress report from the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/20/Wide-Finder">Wide Finder Project</a>,
in which I try to paint a picture of what the solution <em>should</em> look
like.
The project really has two goals.  First, to establish whether it’s possible
to write code that solves this problem and runs much faster in a many-core
environment.  Second, to consider how that code should look to the programmer
who has to write it.</p>
<p><i>[In the background, Steve Vinoski and I are both grinding away trying to
convince Erlang to do file-reading and line-matching efficiently.  Other
people are contributing ideas both from Erlang-land and in other languages.
We’ll get back to that.]</i></p>
<p>Here’s the original Ruby Wide Finder program that we’re trying to replicate
the semantics of, with a one-character change.</p>
<pre><code>counts = {}
counts.default = 0

ARGF.each_line<span style="font-size: 130%; font-weight: bold; color: #f00;">*</span> do |line|
  if line =~ %r{GET /ongoing/When/\d\d\dx/(\d\d\d\d/\d\d/\d\d/[^ .]+) }
    counts[$1] += 1
  end
end

keys_by_count = counts.keys.sort { |a, b| counts[b] &lt;=> counts[a] }
keys_by_count[0 .. 9].each do |key|
  puts "#{counts[key]}: #{key}"
end</code></pre>
<p>See, the <code>each_line</code> method has become <code>each_line*</code>
with the addition of a <code>*</code>, which I’ve coloured red to make it stand out.
It says “Dear Ruby, I don’t care about the order of the invocations of the block
here, and there will be no problems if you run many copies of it in parallel.
Figure it out and make it go fast, please.”</p>
<p><i>[I’m not seriously proposing this as a syntax convention, although it’s
not entirely implausible on the face of it, given Ruby’s conventions around
<code>?</code> and <code>!</code>.  This is just a thought experiment
proposing that there be a really simple way for a programmer to mark something
as parallelizable.]</i></p>
<p>Now, this doesn’t <em>quite</em> work, because the <code>counts</code> hash
is shared-state, so you’d have to do something about that.</p>
<p>I’m not asking for the detection of concurrency to be automatic, because
that just feels too hard; it’s OK to require the programmer to tell the system
what parts to parallelize.  But it shouldn’t require more than a character or
two of syntactic overhead.</p>
<p><i>[Update: If you’re programming in C++ and have access to an OpenMP
library, you can do something like this:]</i></p>
<pre><code>#pragma omp parallel do
for (int i = 0; i &lt; MAX; i++) {
  some_sub(i);
}

somesub(int i) {
  parallel stuff();
#pragma omp critical
  do_crit_section();
}</code></pre>

<body>
<p>This is the seventh progress report from the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/20/Wide-Finder">Wide Finder Project</a>,
in which I report on the work of others and turn this into kind of a
contest.  I’ll be back later with one more whack at Erlang, and then probably
move on to other Wide Finder options.
<i>[Update: If you’re working on this but I missed you, sorry; holler at me
and I’ll make sure you get covered.]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Pi Calculus</h2>
<p>Since I started this thing out with a little Ruby program, let’s start this
report with work from Assaf Arkin.  In
<a href="http://blog.labnotes.org/2007/09/28/pi-cture-this-pi-calculus-ruby-and-widefinder/">Pi-cture this: Pi-calculus, Ruby and WideFinder</a>,
he introduces the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi-calculus">π-calculus</a> and a Ruby
library that implements it.</p>
<p>He follows up with
<a href="http://blog.labnotes.org/2007/09/30/widefinder-ruby-pic-and-scaling-up-out-and-away/">WideFinder, Ruby Pic, and Scaling Up, Out and Away</a>,
running the code and actually measuring the results.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Lisp</h2>
<p>Well, it was only a matter of time.  See
<a href="http://www.method-combination.net/blog/archives/2007/09/29/wide-finder-in-lisp.html">wide finder in lisp</a>
by Irate Nate.  I note that the Lisp code, while not as compact as the Ruby,
is a lot more compact than the Erlang.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>C++</h2>
<p>The Machine Elf writes
<a href="http://www.tincancamera.com/blog/2007/09/wide-finder-parallelism-and-languages.html"> Wide finder, parallelism and languages</a>;
his C++ implementation is actually shorter than Steve Vinoski’s first cut in
Erlang, which I find amusing.</p>
<p>He runs his test on ancient creaking SPARC boxes, and brings
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface">MPI</a> into
play, which seems reasonable enough.  He struggles with the fact that the Wide
Finder can be (but need not be, I argue) I/O-bound.  Still, I recommend
reading this piece, in particular the closing <cite>Conclusion</cite>
paragraph, which includes some first-rate lateral thinking about the
specifics of this problem.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Parrot</h2>
<p>At linux devcenter, Kevin Farnham writes 
<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/linux/blog/2007/09/open_source_thoughts_parrot_an_1.html">Open Source Thoughts: Parrot and Multicore</a>,
which doesn’t actually reference Wide Finder at all, but is clearly thinking
about the same space.  He proposes that the Parrot VM (specifically aimed at
being the substrate for Perl 6, but with loftier dreams) might be a good basis
for progress in the multi-core world.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Python</h2>
<p>Santiago Gala contributes
<a href="http://memojo.com/~sgala/blog/2007/09/29/Python-Erlang-Map-Reduce">Python, Erlang, Map/Reduce</a>.
His Python code is one line shorter than my Ruby version and, he claims, more
elegant.  Check it out and make up your own mind.  He has no performance data
yet.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Erlang</h2>
<p>Over at Caoyuan’s blog, there’s
<a href="http://blogtrader.net/page/dcaoyuan?entry=tim_bray_s_erlang_exercise">Tim Bray's Erlang Exercise on Large Dataset Processing</a>,
which provides a <em>huge</em> glob of Erlang code and better numbers than
I’ve got so far.  Also he points to a
<a href="http://www.erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2007-September/029549.html">contribution
from Per Gustafsson</a> with even better numbers.</p>
<p>But for my money, the most interesting Wide Finder Erlang work is being
done by Steve Vinoski.  His second report from the coal-face is
<a href="http://steve.vinoski.net/blog/2007/09/29/more-file-processing-with-erlang/">More File Processing with Erlang</a>.
It’s long and dense and meaty and worth reading.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>The Contest</h2>
<p>They tell me I’ll soon be able to get my hands on a pre-release
<a href="http://www.sun.com/processors/UltraSPARC-T2/">T2</a>-based server.
I will make a serious effort to run as many of these Wide Finders as
practicable on that machine with lots of gigabytes of real data, and will report on results.  Bear in mind that
the T2 has a top cycle speed of only 1.4Ghz, plus <em>remarkable</em> I/O and
memory subsystems, plus 8 cores with 64 hardware threads.  My expectation is
that the Wide Finder won’t be I/O limited on this box, and all these
parallelism stratagems people have been grinding away at will pay fruit.</p>
<p>But there’s only one way to find out.</p>
<p>And it occurs to me that anyone who can make this puppy fly on the T2 will
have done Sun a real favor, and deserves a big thank-you; I’ll see what I can
arrange.</p>

<p>I read my non-Sun email through GMail these days.  It’s amusing to watch
the ebb and flow of spam, as the bad guys figure out a way through the
defenses, then Google patches that hole; repeat forever.  But there 
could be a lot less.  If I could pick the character sets I can read, then it’d
be automatic that anything in Chinese or
Cyrillic or Hebrew or Arabic or Farsi or Devanagari is spam.  Plus, anything
that mentions lottery in the title or the body, even once.  Plus, anything
where the title is of the form “From XXX XXX”.  That’d catch at least 75% of
what’s still getting through.</p>

<title>The Intimate Internet</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Here’s the thing: the Net’s killer app has always been other people.   There
are side benefits, like access to all the world’s information.  But the links
that matter aren’t between pages but people, and they’re
strong and rich and subtle.  Multiply the infinite flavors in
human relationships by a thickening bundle of means-to-connect; that product is
what’s new and what’s good and what’s exciting.  People who are looking for
the Next Big Thing are mostly looking in the wrong places.
And anyway, you don’t need to look, it’ll find you.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>History</h2>
<p>During the early years of the Web, I used to run this thought experiment:
“Suppose they banned email; would it be worthwhile keeping the Internet
running just for the Web?”  The answer was, well, maybe.  “Suppose they shut
the Web down and all you had was email; keep it running?”  The answer was yes,
obviously.</p>
<p>It’s not <em>quite</em> the same today.  Google did what they said they
would, 
figured out how to provide access to all the world’s information; which
is another good reason for the Net.  And guess what,
that news story is more or less over.  I just don’t
believe we’ll see dramatic improvements in search quality, and the
balance of forces is such that anyone who husbands good information 
now sees it as their responsibility to put it where Google and friends can
find it.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, email’s importance fades; the young use it less and less.
But the volume and intensity of conversation keeps cranking up, it’s just
moved onto chat and blogs and wikis 
and Facebook and Twitter and Flickr and so on and so forth.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Coffee Shop</h2>
<p>It feels pleasant to step into my local on the way to the office (double
latte in my own 
cup).  Yeah, it’s warm when cold outside, shady when sunny,
smells of coffee and baking.
But that’s background; what matters is the faces I
recognize and others I don’t, and always, <em>always</em>, the buzz of
conversation.</p>
<p>That’s what the Net’s starting to feel like.  I’ve got my email (two
accounts) and my chat (a half-dozen) and IRC (three rooms, usually), and now
Twitter.  Each has its own combination of latency and message size and
one-to-one-ness or otherwise.  Wouldn’t want to be without any of ’em.</p>
<p>What about Facebook?  I don’t know; clearly, it’s just the thing for
getting your college dorm or high-tech mixer set up.  But for me, the value is
in promoting intimacy, seeing what my friends are doing.  And Twitter hits
that 80/20 point, bringing me that news without all the Facebook bullshit and lame
groups and dorky apps and stupid ads and data lock-in.  So recently I don’t
Facebook much.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>The Next Big Thing?</h2>
<p>Two fearless predictions: it’ll be about a new way to connect to people,
and it won’t show up first on either Techmeme or TechCrunch.  What actually got
this post going was a Twitter exchange.  I posted <i>Techmeme is boring. The real news is elsewhere in places they're not looking</i> and 
Scoble pushed back <i>I read 800 feeds and TechMeme doesn't miss much.</i></p>
<p>I dunno, I go there and see the same stories about the RIAA and Paul
Graham’s latest essay and what Apple might be doing, the same stories that are
on Slashdot
and Ars Technica and boring old ZDnet too.  Plus a smattering of whatever
Scoble &amp; Winer &amp; Arrington &amp; Calcanis and their posses are up to.
Plus all these vendors trying to convince everyone that they need “Rich”
Internet Applications. (I think rich interaction is about people not animated
vector graphics, but what do I know?)
There’s nothing <em>wrong</em> with it.  But also nothing I’m not
getting already.</p>
<p>TechCrunch?  The top story when I last checked was “Pixsy To Power Search
On Veoh”.  I’m containing my excitement.</p>
<p>It seems there’s an inward-facing circle scattered around San Francisco and
its peninsula; they’re smart and experienced and money-hungry and very alert.
But when the next big thing comes along (and I love this business, because I
know it will) you won’t have to rely on the professional noticers to tell you
because it’ll touch your life directly.  Probably by opening another conduit
for the flow of
<a href="http://strange.corante.com/archives/2007/10/04/fowa07b_leisa_reichelt.php">ambient
intimacy</a> (that link showed up on one channel or another while I was
writing this; dig it).  And here’s me on Twitter from September 12th: <i>sinking
ever more deeply into the ambient Internet human buzz</i>.</p>
<p>In the big picture, I’m not sure anything else matters much.</p>

<p>Looking south along the beach.  There’s a piney bluff at its back which the
sun is rising behind, so for a few minutes its light marches weirdly in from
west to east as the cliffshadow retreats.  In this picture there’s no direct
light on the waves.</p>

<title>WF VIII: Snapshot</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is the eighth progress report from the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/20/Wide-Finder">Wide Finder Project</a>; a
quick comment-light aggregation of work that other people have been
doing in the space.  I’ve managed to get access to an unannounced
many-core
server and have some preliminary results (summary: Vinoski’s in the
lead); I’ll publish those in the, uh, very near future, when things are, uh,
less unannounced.</p>
<p>I’ll also make a serious effort to grab all the code I’ve been linking to
here and run it on the T2 and report back, but probably won’t be able to start
till 
next Thursday.  By the way, extra credit is given for
solving the whole problem and replicating the <em>all</em> the function of the
original Ruby script; computing the ten most popular fetches by matching a
pattern that includes the <code>GET</code> in front of the URI.
If you’re working on this and I’ve missed you, shoot me a line.</p>
<p>OK, off to the races.</p>

<title>Testing the T5120</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This was going to be a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/20/Wide-Finder">Wide Finder Project</a>
progress report, but I ended up writing so much about the server that I’d
better dedicate another fragment to the comparisons of all those
implementations; 
especially since there are still lots more implementations to test.
So this a hands-on report on a
couple of more-or-less production T5120’s, the
<a href="http://www.sun.com/processors/UltraSPARC-T2/">T2</a>-based server
that’s being
<a href="http://www.sun.com/servers/coolthreads/">announced today</a>.
Headlines: The chip is impressive but weird; 
astounding message-passing benchmark numbers; fighting the US DoD.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Logistics</h2>
<p>I actually didn’t start the Wide Finder work because we were about to
announce these servers, it was just an interesting idea one afternoon that’s
kind of spiraled out of control.  But when I realized the date was imminent,
testing some of the code on the new box was a no-brainer.</p>
<p>Actually getting to use one was a problem.  Without going into the details
of Sun’s release process, the period after the server’s been validated
and the first wave is coming out of manufacturing is pretty intense and weird.
I don’t know if this is a forward-looking business statement, but it seems
that all the ones that have been built have been sold; I know this because 
a certain number of servers that were supposed to be for internal use got
diverted to customers.</p>
<p>For example, the one I was working on one afternoon
last week, trying to get Erlang to act sane.  I got a message out of the blue:
“Hi Tim, this is Brian, you don’t know me.  Can you be off that box in a
half-hour?  We have to wipe and re-install and ship it to the Department of
Defense by tomorrow morning.”  I was pissed, but customers obviously come
first and fighting the US DoD is generally a bad idea.</p>
<p>I never saw any of these; they were just addresses like
<code>sca12-3200a-40.sfbay.sun.com</code>, equipped with Solaris 10, an
<code>ssh</code> server, and damn little else.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Logistics and I/O</h2>
<p>I tested on two servers; the one they re-routed me too was apparently about
the same as the one the United States Armed Forces snagged: 8
cores at 1.4GHz, 16G of RAM, with some pukey little 80G local partition
mounted.  I probably should have poked around and built a nice ZFS pool on the
rest of that disk, but my Solaris-fu is weak and my time was short.</p>
<p>The reason I say that is that the filesystem performance was kind of
weird. If you look at the specs on these suckers, they ought to be I/O
monsters, and in fact the T1 servers are; but I suspect it’s really worthwhile
putting a little effort into getting things set up.  On that little local
partition, a run of Bonnie with a 16G file showed that <code>stdio</code>
could fairly easily max out one core just reading data (getting excellent
rates, mind you).  I mention this not because it’s indicative of the system
performance (this disk setup is obviously not typical of anything you’d put into
production) but it may well be relevant to the Wide Finder numbers.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>What It’s Good At</h2>
<p>I ran the Erlang message-passing benchmark that
<a href="http://www.franklinmint.fm/blog/archives/000792.html">Rob Sayre ran
on the T2000</a>.  Check his graph, and compare this.</p>
<img src="Erlang-message-passing.png" alt="Erlang message passing performance on the T5120" />
<p>On the T1, the best time to run 1000 processes was just under 30 seconds;
which took under 7 seconds on the T2.  I wonder if there’s any computer of any
description anywhere in the world that can beat this?</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>It’s Weird</h2>
<p>Let me illustrate the weirdness with by showing a run of
<a href="http://steve.vinoski.net/blog/2007/09/29/more-file-processing-with-erlang/">Steve Vinoski’s 
<code>tbray5</code> Erlang code</a> on a 971 Mb file with about four
million logfile entries:</p>
<pre><code> ~/n2/code/> time erl -noshell -smp -run tbray5 main 400 ../logs/mar.ap 
463455 matches found
Delta runtime 2097520, wall clock 72939

real    1m13.346s
user    34m57.821s
sys     1m5.211s</code></pre>
<p>Now, a minute and a quarter or so elapsed is very good; in fact, the
fastest of any of the implementations I’ve tested so far.  But the amount of
user CPU reported (the program, in milliseconds, and the <code>time</code>
output are consistent) is weird; showing 28 times as much CPU time as elapsed
time.</p>
<p>Well, this puppy has, eight cores, each with eight logical threads, so
Solaris sees it as having 64 logical processors.  While Steve’s code was
running, the Unix command-line utilities were reporting maybe the CPU as 50%
busy, i.e. 32 processors working, 32 idle, so that is kind of consistent with
28 times as much CPU as elapsed.  But hold on a dag-blaggin’ second, there are
really only eight cores, right?  So I went sniffing around among various
hardware and Solaris experts, and here’s what’s going on.</p>
<p>First of all, each of the eight cores has two integer threads; so it’s kind
of like having 8 <em>dual-core</em> cores (yes, I know that sounds absurd).
So reporting a CPU time of 16 times the clock time might be plausible; but not
28.</p>
<p>Further poking dug up the answer: it seems that the hardware doesn’t tell
the OS how it’s sharing out the cycles among the the threads that it has
runnable at any point in time.  So Solaris just credits them with user CPU
time whenever they’re in Run state.  The results will be correct when you have
up to sixteen threads staying runnable; above that they get funky.  I gather
the T1 had this peculiarity too.</p>
<p>This is not a big deal once you understand what’s going on, but it sure had
me puzzled for a while.  And holy cow, can you ever grind through a monster
integer computing workload with this puppy.</p>
<p>I’ll stop here, and come back with a bunch of reports on all those Wide
Finder implementations.  Assuming nobody steals my server in the meantime.</p>

<title>The T2 Servers</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>These T5x20 servers we’re
<a href="http://www.sun.com/servers/coolthreads/">announcing today</a> are a big deal.  My bet is
that they end up making Sun a lot of money; but on the way, they’re going to 
bring the whole server business (not just Sun’s piece of it) face to face with
some real disruption.</p>
<p><i>[Update: Wow, dig the
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/allanp/entry/cmt_comes_of_age">blog
storm</a>.]</i></p>
<p>This isn’t Sun’s first many-core “CoolThreads” server, but the
first-generation T1 is kind of weird; soaks up huge volumes of Web traffic but
shares one floating-point core and probably isn’t what you’d call a
“General-Purpose” computer.  These new boxes are general-purpose all right;
the only weak spot I see is big CPU-bound jobs that
just just won’t parallelize for some reason.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Tech Problem</h2>
<p>With the arrival of the T2, we’re all staring a many-core future in the
face.  I’ve spilled
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/Concurrency/">thousands
of words</a> on the subject, and in the recent
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/20/Wide-Finder">Wide Finder</a> series,
have been <i>mano a mano</i> with the problems.
(Yes, there are many cases where you can
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/06/07/Concurrency">ignore threading</a>, but
there are others where you can’t.)</p>
<p>It’s not gonna be a particularly smooth or painless transition.  But it’s
unavoidable; the only way to deliver large-scale systems at
a sane price, particularly if you count in your heating &amp; HVAC costs down
the road.</p>
<p>Granted, there’s always scaling out rather than up; some loads will be better
served by huge numbers of cheap servers, but there’s still a big
place in rational system architectures for a box with Really Big concurrency
and Really Big I/O.  Particularly if it’s only 2U and cheap to run.
Particularly if your whole app will run on the one box (and lots will on this
one), so you don’t have to get into the scaling-out voodoo.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Business Problem</h2>
<p>I was doing some customer work last June, toward the end of Sun’s Q4,
hanging out with salespeople who were in year-end crunch mode.
This one woman was all happy because she’d cut two last-minute deals.  One
was for a couple of racks of T1-based systems, the other a big storage
build-out. 
She was happier about the storage deal, and I wondered why.</p>
<p>“Problem is,” she said, “you sell someone Niagaras and you won’t see them
again for a year or more, those suckers can soak up scary loads.  But you sell
them storage and they’ll be back in six months, guaranteed.  Everybody’s data
is out of control.”</p>
<p>I can tell
you from my hands-on work, the T2 boxes are going to soak up even scarier
loads.  But it isn’t our sales-force who should be scared.  It’s the
competition.  “Buy some of these and you won’t need more any
time soon.”  Seems like a pretty good pitch to me.</p>

<title>Starving in Vegas</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Under what circumstances should you burn a System-Wide upgrade certificate
to get breakfast?</p>
<p>What happened was, I had to get up at 5AM to make my flight to Vegas,
connecting through LAX.  At Vancouver Airport security, there was an elderly
gentleman before me in the security line, and the X-Ray guy got round-eyed 
looking at his bag, and called his supervisor, who called in a guy in a
black uniform with a big gun, and he called <em>his</em> supervisor.</p>
<p>They stopped the line and sent the people whose stuff wasn’t stuck inside
the machine off to other lines.  The rest of us waited while things got tenser
and tenser.  The passenger seemed really respectable and harmless; I suspect
that if he’d been carrying a Quran or looked “Middle Eastern” some severe
ethnic profiling, involving handcuffs and attack dogs, would have
broken out.</p>
<p>Anyhow, they talked to the elderly gent and I overheard something about “a
present from his sister, an antique”, and then they took out of his carry-on,
I kid you not, an 
old-fashioned alarm clock, the kind with the bell on top, and it had wires
coming out of it running into a featureless black box.</p>
<p>Anyhow, after I finally got my bags I had to scurry to the plane, so no
breakfast, and United doesn’t feed the peons, and the LAX connection was
tight, so when I finally got to the Sun conference in Vegas, I was glad they
were handing out the box lunches.  
Except for they hollered at me to upload my talk <em>right
away</em> and I had to post the new-server blogs and I saw a couple people I
wanted to talk to, and then I figured 
I’d drop my stuff in the hotel room before my speech, and it was the usual
Vegas scene with 800 people lined up to check in, so I only got a couple of
bites of a chicken wrap.</p>
<p>After my talk and some more schmoozing, I was feeling faint with hunger;
thank God that
<a href="http://cld.blog-city.com/">Charles Ditzel</a> and
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/bs/">Bob Sokol</a> suggested a beer, and we
shared some potato skins and chicken wings; this gave me enough
strength to totter off to the big party over at the Palms.</p>
<p>There’s just no good way to feed four thousand people at once.  I stood in
line for half an hour (which was OK, there was tons of entertainment), and by
the time I got to the front, all that was left 
were vegetarian kebabs; I had three, and they were tasty but didn’t really
solve my problem.  And the
party was just too big and I didn’t know enough people, so I decided to walk
home to get some real Vegas atmosphere.  Ha ha ha.  Vegas just isn’t set up
for that, and a wrong turn led me trudging down the side of an empty freeway
with no way across.  But I got home eventually, still starving but too tired
to do anything but crash.</p>
<p>Another 5AM call for the flight home.  It was on United but nope, that’s
operated by Air Canada in the other terminal, another lengthy hungry encumbered
trudge through the exhaust-fume-enhanced desert air.  By the time I got there,
the minutes were ticking down; as I checked in, I 
remembered my upgrade coupons, which I try to hoard for the big trips across
the big oceans, and thought of the actual food you get in business class.  It
worked!</p>
<p>Man, that was a damn fine breakfast.</p>

<title>The Plot Thickens</title>

<body>
<p>Ah, I see the RubyForgers have the
<a href="http://tomcopeland.blogs.com/juniordeveloper/2007/10/new-hardware-fo.html">new
server on the air</a>.  That 4200 should do quite a bit better than the
<em>very</em> basic Xeon it’s replacing, particularly since they were maxed
out on I/O.</p>
<p>Actually, the RubyForge server was a bit of a clumsy exercise; first we
shipped them the wrong model, then we forgot to ship rails for it.  I mean rails
not Rails, the things that hold it in the rack.  Oh well,
looks like a happy ending.</p>
<p>Insiders will realize that this is another step in our nefarious master
plan to subvert the Ruby community.  Someone’s been talking too much though: DHH
found out about the 
<a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/posts/11-sun-surprises-at-railsconf-europe-2007">evil
guy with the cat</a> (check the last para).
Now that we’ve placed servers with Matz’s group and at RubyForge, and helped
out the Rubinius code sprint, if we can just figure out how to
get another of those innocent-looking boxes into the Rails dev shop,
it’s just a matter of turning a switch and they’ll all be
re-programmed into Java fanboys.</p>

<p>So, I got distracted by a server launch and a Vegas trip, but the Wide
Finder implementations keep rolling in.</p>
<p>I will try to run as many of these as I can
manage on the T2 servers and report back, but it’ll take a while.  Also, since
the servers I have access to are pretty naked, I have to build all the
infrastructure myself, and if it takes heroic effort to get something running,
I probably just won’t.</p>

<title>The Phantom Hourglass</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>At the beginning of the year, we got a Nintendo DS to improve the then
seven-year-old’s quality of life on the long flight to our Australian
vacation.  Recently I bought the just-released 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Phantom_Hourglass">Legend of Zelda: The Phantom Hourglass</a>, and have put in a
little time fooling with it.</p>
<p>The DS is a dinky, slow, limited platform, and the experience will never be
immersive. Having said that, Zelda’s quite a bit of fun.  The UI is radical;
you do everything with the stylus on the touch-screen.  It uses the other DS
capabilities cleverly, too: the map’s on the upper screen, only you can swap
screens to scribble notes and landmarks on the map.  And to open some doors,
you have to blow out candles; so hold the DS up to your face for some huffing
and puffing; remember the microphone?</p>
<p>The boy is having trouble. Some of the puzzles
require stopping to think and reading the clues carefully, with attention to
detail.  If he could upgrade his skills in those areas, that would
<em>really</em> improve his quality of life.  So I’m cheerleading, helping him
through the tough bits and hoping he gets the message.</p>
<p>And occasionally picking up the DS for an hour or two when everyone’s gone
to bed.  Taste the boomerang of death, monsters!</p>

<title>Chestnut Dusk</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Well, that was a crappy week.  Not only was I <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/10/10/Starving-in-Vegas">hungry in
Vegas</a>, I wasn’t there long enough, so the travel-time ratio was way out of
line.  Plus there was the 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/10/13/Commies">quality time with the
Commies</a>, and then of course
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/10/13/The-Outage">the outage</a>.  This is by
way of saying that it wasn’t all bad.</p>
<p>What happened was, we had Wednesday evening soccer, maybe this year’s
last outside practice.  Walking home in the
fast-falling dusk, three grown-ups and five children, they whooped and ran,
chattering emptily.  We parents trudged, talking
city politics and real-estate prices and child-care; then
noticed we were alone.   That block was 
lined with chestnut trees, and someone had swept a yard-high pile of fallen
nuts, so the boys had stopped to hunt.  Walking away, they had
their shirts pulled up in front full of lustrous brown treasures, and they
talked of 
selling them or saving them, and we talked of the excellence of the
smell of roasting chestnuts on Paris streets in cold evenings, and the
disappointment of their taste.</p>
<p>We were cold and tired and hungry but our homes’ warmth with dinner
waiting was near and the boys were walking along near us carefully
to protect their takings and the autumn sky showed dark between the
trees’ branches still mostly green but with colour creeping in.  And I thought
that this is a time we’ll look back on afterward, this is a day
we’ll mean when we say those were the days.</p>

<p>One of this week’s deliverables was a visa for the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/08/31/Shanghai">Shanghai trip</a>.
This involved a total of about five
hours in line at the Vancouver PRC consulate, an unpleasant
place; but the visa looks great.</p>
<p>Outside, there are the Falun Gong people complaining about being
abused; inside, leaflets complaining about the Falun Gong being liars.
Inside, it’s not notably worse than any other public-sector waiting room,
except for the altercations.  On several occasions 
there were outbursts of shouting and arm-waving, on one occasion involving
security types hustling someone out of the room.  Then when I got to the front
of the line to pick up my passport, I had to wait 15 minutes because it was
the official’s break time. During the wait, a woman barged in front of me
and when snarled at in various languages, said something in English about
being rejected and wanting her passport back.  This developed into an extended
shouting match, if I knew Putonghua I’d have learned the (probably terribly sad)
story.  Really quite nasty.</p>

<p>I got an email from someone, the <span class='o'>ongoing</span> comment
system had blown up mysteriously.  My logfiles were weirdly truncated.  Then
the whole site just vanished.  The subject of the email from sysadmin
Matt: “So much for it not being as bad as it looked....”</p>
<p>Fortunately, there was a hot on-site backup.  Unfortunately, the disaster
took it out too.  Fortunately, there was a pretty-warm off-site backup.

want tens of thousands of little files? Got those too.  Sigh.</p>
<p>Near as I can tell, all I lost were a couple of comments from Thursday and
Friday; in particular, I <em>know</em> there were a couple on

yours that got lost, sorry.</p>
<p>For some reason I had to rebuild Ruby, but

<p>Please let me know about broken links or other weirdness.
It was awfully disturbing to be off the air; this is the first occasion since

<p>Dear LazyWeb: we’re looking for a great big honkin’ storage server to sit
on the home network and be a backup pool for the motley crew of computers
around the house: Mac, Solaris, Ubuntu, &amp; Windows.
<a href="http://www.webmink.net/">Simon Phipps</a> has a
<a href="http://www.buffalotech.com/home/">Buffalo TeraStation</a> and is
very happy with it.  On the other hand, there’s
<a href="http://terastation.org/wiki/Main_Page">a wiki</a> which suggests it’s
kind of loud, and it’s going to be hard for us to get it behind closed doors.
Might the Net have a suggestion?</p>

<title>Counting Subscribers</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Rob Scoble is
<a href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/10/14/how-many-google-reader-subscribers-do-you-have/">reporting</a> Google-Reader subscriber
counts for popular sites.
These are interesting numbers and (I suspect) a reasonably useful metric of 
relative popularity.  But some of the evidence is
puzzling.</p>
<p><i>[Update, the next day: 
Google
<a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2007/10/subscriber-stats-summed-up.html">provides
some explanations</a> and updated their numbers; their spider and the Google
Reader page now show the same subscriber count: 4,404.]</i></p>
<p>Google Reader reports that I have 3,690 subscribers
(Bloglines reports another 4,462).  What’s weird is that “Feedfetcher”, their
feed-crawling robot, also reports subscribers an a way that shows up in my
webserver logfiles.  To be precise, it reports 4,403 
subscribers to my Atom feed and 1,455 to the RSS version (which is now a
<em>permanent</em> redirect to the Atom; silly, <em>silly</em> Feedfetcher).
Combining 1,455 and 4,462 and getting 3,690 seems reasonable, actually,
assuming Google’s correcting for people who subscribe to both, and people who
are inactive; it’d be kind of nice to know what’s up though.  Bloglines’
robot, on the other hand, reports the same number of subscribers that the site
does.</p>

<body>
<p>Check out
<a href="http://www.10zenmonkeys.com/2007/10/05/is-the-net-good-for-writers/"> Is The Net Good For Writers?</a>,
compiled by RU Sirius.  Thoughtful, but I think it ignores part
of the landscape.  This via Nick Carr’s
<a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/10/the_word_on_the.php">The
word on the net</a>, which has me seriously irritated; I look forward with
venom to reviewing his book, which just arrived in the mail.
<i>[Warning: this fragment is appallingly self-centred.]</i></p>
<p><i>[Update: Awww... Prof. Carr has
<a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/10/the_word_on_the.php">updated</a>.  While this makes
me happy, I can’t pass up the opportunity to make a serious point: has any
previous medium supported the publication of serious ideas to the whole world
in a form which allows for real-time revision and partakes of conversation?
If we can just sort out the economics, this has the potential to be a Golden
Age for writers.]</i></p>
<p>The <cite>Is The Net Good For Writers?</cite> writers are to a one
professional full-timers, and their feelings about the issue are at best
mixed, because whatever your feelings, it’s obvious the Net is blowing up the
existing economic models for professional communicators and it’s far from
clear what will replace them.  I’m part of whatever the new thing is, I
think, but I feel genuine sympathy for people who’ve been relying on the
existing model.</p>
<p>The problem with the collection, if I may be egregiously egocentric,
is that it ignores me.  Or rather, the class of which I’m a
member: people who have found success in writing online, success which
would have been unlikely in the <i>ancien régime</i>.
The words you are now reading aren’t the entirety of my job, but they’re a
large and essential part of it.</p>
<p>There are lots like me who’ve combined niche knowledge and writing
to build a decent career.  We don’t make as much as Stephen
King, but I bet we do well compared to the non-superstar writers.
The #1 lesson in Creative Writing has always been “Write What You Know”; if
you believe this, the advent of a large number of people with specialized
knowledge who earn their living writing about it should be
unsurprising.</p>
<p>Only one thing has changed: Now there’s no scarcity of access
to the means of publication.
But that’s a big thing, and we’re still far from understanding the
implications.  For example, blogger culture values short-form writing, high
update rate, and a transparent/unedited personal voice.  Are these things
ephemeral, or essential to the form?</p>
<p>Nicholas Carr, not afraid to draw broad-brush conclusions, considers the
collection and
<a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/10/the_word_on_the.php">concludes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It seems to turn on how you view writing. If you see it as a
utilitarian information-delivery vehicle, then the net's boffo. If you see it
as a craft that's as much an end as a means, then the net's a
curse.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which seems pretty much bullshit to me.  I don’t know a single successful
blogger who doesn’t obsess about writing, and re-write and re-write and tinker
and fiddle, and then do it some more after hitting the “publish” button.
Like most reasonably-successful bloggers, I’ve pumped hundreds of thousands of
words into this space over the years, and you’re just not gonna do that unless
you care.</p>
<p>Actually I’m a fanatic about the written language; 
I feel no stress in liking both Vikram Seth and Barry Lopez on dead trees, and
Paul Ford and Mark Pilgrim on my screen; and William Gibson both places.  
Anyone who maintains there’s an absolute quality delta between what was and
what is, between what’s on paper and what’s on screen, isn’t looking where I am.</p>
<p>I’m trying hard to read Carr’s remark as anything but a nasty direct
attack on what I do for a living, but I think that’s what it is.  Fortunately I have
an outlet for my spleen; the Professor’s new book
<a href="http://www.nicholasgcarr.com/bigswitch/">The Big Switch</a> just
arrived in the mail, and at the moment I’m really predisposed to dislike it.
So if you read nothing more about it in this space, that means it’s probably
pretty good and I couldn’t indulge in the mean-spirited flame that I’d like to.
If I say something positive, you’d better all run out and buy it right away.</p>

<title>5★♫: Brain Plays Mozart</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Continuing the theme (from
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/08/27/Kremer-plays-Bach">August</a>, argh, maybe I don’t have a
5★ life) of music written by dead guys, and in this case also played by
a dead guy.  The dead composer is Mozart, the performer
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Brain">Dennis Brain</a>.
I refer to Brain’s 1955 recording of the Mozart horn concertos with
the assistance of Von Karajan and the Philharmonia Orchestra.
You already know this music.  You may not think so, but trust me, as soon as
it starts playing you’ll think “Oh, <em>yes</em>”.   I’m not sure whether it’s
everyone actually having heard it, or whether Mozart tapped into something so
smooth, polished, and elemental as to convince us that we’re on familiar and
well-loved territory. Nobody could call this
obscure, it’s sold a kazillion copies; but perhaps not in recent decades.
<i>(“5★♫” series introduction <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music">here</a>;
with <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music#p-1">an
explanation</a> of why the title may look broken.)</i></p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Context</h2>
<p>Dennis Brain, who died when I was two years old, probably still remains the
ideal to which classical horn players aspire.</p>
<img src="brain.jpg" alt="Dennis Brain" />
<p>David Terry, a friend and colleague with whom I’ve lost touch, came from a
BBC family, and told me that his mother told him that Dennis Brain was a party
animal, would drink till dawn and somewhere along the way play these tunes on
a vacuum-cleaner hose just for fun.  The Wikipedia entry says that he even
brought the hoses out in public once.</p>
<img class="inline" src="Brain-Mozart.jpg" alt="Dennis Brain plays Mozart concertos with Von Karajan's help" />
<h2 id='p-2'>The Music</h2>
<p>This recording first came into
our family, on LP of course, when I was a really little kid; and I can
remember the cover, in white and yellow and gold, a celestial being standing
inside the loop of the horn it was playing.</p>
<p>In my
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Dad</a>’s later years, after I dug this up on CD, we put it on late one
night and drank some whiskey and didn’t say much; I said “Remember the white
and gold album with the angel in the loop of the horn?” and
he said “Oh, <em>yes</em>” and we both smiled.</p>
<p>Look, it’s not adventurous or subversive or dangerous or complex.
Doesn’t challenge any 
traditions or push any envelopes.  It’s just exceptionally
smooth and beautiful.  Mr Mozart wrote as many lovely tunes you can hum
along with as anyone who’s lived before or since, and Mr Brain, he could play
the horn as well as anyone who’s ever been recorded.  What else might you
want?</p> 
<h2 id='p-3'>Sampling It</h2>
<p>I remain convinced that Compact Discs remain the best way to buy music;
high-quality, DRM-free, and they constitute their own backup once you’ve
ripped ’em.  
But on this one, the recording quality is only average (which doesn’t matter if
the music is good enough).
So given that Mozart, Brain, Von Karajan and probably anyone
else who contributed creatively to this recording are long, long dead, I’d
find it hard to find a moral basis for disapproving of grabbing a decent copy
online if you can find one.</p>

<title>Minneapolis OK</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The flight down here, on a brand-new little Embraer, was horrid.
Minneapolis was having weather issues and held us on the ground in Vancouver,
then we circled our destination for a half-hour.  The pilot came on and said
“Well, ladies and gentleman — uh, hold on” (a minute’s silence) “I was about to
tell you that we’d been diverted to Duluth, but we just got clearance for
Minnie”.  He said it was a thousand-foot ceiling, but I think that was
optimistic.  Anyhow, I thought I’d stick my head out of the hotel and see
about dinner and the ball game.  Right across the street was the
<a href="http://www.townhallbrewery.com/">Town Hall Brewery</a>, and I
recommend it wholeheartedly.  Lots of beers, but the first one tried, a
seasonal Scottish Pale Ale (<em>Scottish</em> Pale Ale?  Huh?) was so good
that I stuck with it.  The burger was competent and the fries outstanding, I
mean really great.  Plus, they had comfy chairs and sofas set up in front of a
big HDTV screen to watch the ball game.  Friendly strangers to argue with
about Joe Borowski and Mike Timlin (who was pitching for the Blue Jays when I
was watching them win the Series in ’92, he’s still throwing 93mph, yow).
Town Hall is ten years old and I’d bet on ’em for the long haul.</p>

<p>Tonight, a smaller, bi-focused sweep: Identity and HTTP.</p>
<p>Back in May, Sun
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/05/07/OpenID-at-Sun">rolled out</a> an OpenID
provider with a twist; it was only available to Sun employees.  A bunch of the
people who were involved in the work have written up the story, its
background, the engineering details, and some of the issues around it; check
out
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/2007/10/02/suns-openid-idp-summary/">Lauren

<p>There’s something called
<a href="http://oauth.net/">OAuth</a> that’s starting to make waves
around the identity space.  I haven’t dug into it yet, but I should.</p>
<p>After some months of silence, James Clark (yes, <em>that</em> James Clark)
has had a burst of writing energy, focusing on the problem of digital
signatures for HTTP payloads.  The pieces so far, in order, are

<title>The Tower</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I was talking with an old friend about lots of things including the
Internet and the conversation wandered somehow to the Old Testament.
She asked “Maybe the Net is like the tower of Babel?”  It’s not
that strained an analogy; what we’re trying to build does partake of
large-scale hubris.
“But that story had an unhappy ending” I replied.  And indeed,
were a vengeful hand, divine or otherwise, to intervene, to
<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2011:5-11:8;&amp;version=31;">confuse
our language so we could not understand each other</a>, that would be
disastrous at the scale of Babel.
I don’t think we’re trying to restore the pre-Tower state though: 
<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2011:1;&amp;version=31;">Now the whole world had one language and a common speech</a>.
Trying just to lower conversational friction and barriers to entry for
everyone in the world, that’s hubris enough.

showing up here and there, probably enough to be cost-effective.  In
particular, O’Hare airport, which has ong been T-Mobile (expensive and slow) or
nothing, now has a network that named “Concourse” which uses Boingo and is

<p>While I was in Minneapolis I was walking through a mall and there was the
<a href="http://orange.half-life2.com/">Orange Box</a> on sale.  Under the
influence of
<a href="http://www.somebits.com/weblog/culture/games/portal.html">Nelson
Minar</a> and
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/games/unwrapping-the-orange-box.ars">Ars
Technica</a>, and especially given that it was priced in those inexpensive
Yankee Pesos, I had to pick one up.  I never played Half-Life nor Team
Fortress, but the latter sounds fun; I wonder if we should put together a
dynamic-languages-mafia or concurrency-obsessives team or some such.
I’m 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/07/25/NotGaming">not a serious gamer</a>, so
I started with
<a href="http://orange.half-life2.com/portal.html">Portal</a>.

<a href="http://www.crummy.com/2007/10/21/0">Leonard Richardson</a>; so I
guess I gotta say something.  It’s amazing how deeply embedded in our
collective consciousness is the notion of the lethally impersonal corporation
with a dead marketing voice.  Dear Marketing Professionals; when you think
“message control” several generational cohorts of geeky target demographics
are thinking about the Portal voice.  Go play it, and shudder.</p>

<title>Language Waves</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I suppose I could have entitled this <cite>A General Model for Progress In
Adoption of Popular Programming Languages</cite>.  What happened was, I was
composing a rant intended for use in an internal discussion of
developer futures, and it dawned on me that there’s a repeating
pattern in the waves of programming languages that manage to succeed in
finding broad usage.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Procedural Wave</h2>
<p>Once we staggered out of the Assembler swamps, there were FORTRAN, COBOL,
and PL/1.  They were all popular but all 
deeply flawed.  Eventually C, with approximately similar
capabilities but a much cleaner and better design, came to be the dominant
player at that level.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The O-O Wave</h2>
<p>The next big step up the ladder was the adoption of Object-Orientation,
notably as popularized by C++.  Once again, it became popular but its flaws
were pretty in-your-face.  Java has become dominant in this sector, largely
due to superior language design.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>The Higher-level Wave</h2>
<p>Somewhat but not completely in parallel has been the rise of what I’ll call
Higher-level languages.  These grew out of scripting roots, but quickly became
high-performance general-purpose tools; the genre was established by Perl.</p>
<p>These languages are distinguished by terseness and the use of built-in
convenience features for things like regular expressions and
content-addressable storage.  For new development, Perl is being crowded out
by languages with similar capabilities but better design, notably Python and
Ruby.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Legacy and Energy</h2>
<p>Of course, a programming language, once it’s become mainstream, almost
never dies away.  There’s lots of FORTRAN and COBOL being written to this day;
also C and C++ and Java and Perl.</p>
<p>But I think it’s fair to say that the new-development energy moved from
those other languages to C, then up-hill to C++ and then over to Java, and
now I that energy shifting
rapidly in the direction of Higher-level languages.</p>
<p>You could draw a picture:</p>
<table cellpadding="5">
<tr><th colspan="3">Programming-language Waves</th></tr>
<tr><th></th><th>Flawed<br/>Founders</th><th>Polished<br/>Successors</th></tr>
<tr><th>Procedural</th><td>FORTRAN, COBOL, PL/1</td><td>C</td></tr>
<tr><th>Object-Oriented</th><td>C++</td><td>Java</td></tr>
<tr><th>Higher-Level</th><td>Perl, TCL</td><td>Python, Ruby</td></tr>
</table>
<h2 id='p-5'>What I’m Ignoring</h2>
<p>Lisp, Prolog, Ada, Smalltalk, ML, OCaml, Haskell, yadda yadda yadda.  Yes,
I know these have all been put to good use.  But I’m trying to restrict the
mainline discussion to things that are routinely and unsurprisingly used in
boring commercial shops.</p>
<p>I suppose you could imagine another line in the graph if you step outside
of languages per se into Web frameworks:</p>
<table cellpadding="5">
<tr><th></th><th>Flawed<br/>Founders</th><th>Polished<br/>Successors</th></tr>
<tr><th>Web-Centric</th><td>WebObjects, ColdFusion, ASP.Net, Struts, etc.,
etc., etc., PHP</td><td>Rails</td></tr></table>
<h2 id='p-6'>Half-Tables</h2>
<p>Of course, the fun tables are the ones where the right half isn’t filled in
yet.  For example:</p>
<table cellpadding="5">
<tr><th></th><th>Flawed<br/>Founders</th><th>Polished<br/>Successors</th></tr>
<tr><th>Mobile-Code</th><td>JavaScript</td><td>?</td></tr></table>
<p>I suppose ECMAScript is the obvious candidate to replace the question
mark.
Now here’s the one that really interests me:</p>
<table cellpadding="5">
<tr><th></th><th>Flawed<br/>Founders</th><th>Polished<br/>Successors</th></tr>
<tr><th>Concurrent</th><td>Erlang</td><td>?</td></tr></table>
<p>What would be nice would be if both those question marks were replaced by
the same name; especially if it were one of the ones already listed above.</p>

<p>Today we have music, China, head counts, terrorism,
and telemarketers.</p> 
<h2 id='p-1'>Music</h2>
<p>I’ve had Ian Rogers’
<a href="http://www.fistfulayen.com/blog/?p=127">Convenience Wins, Hubris
Loses and Content vs. Context, a Presentation for Some Music Industry
Friends</a> open in a browser tab for weeks, looking for a chance to use this
quote as evidence of enlightenment: </p>
<blockquote><p>I’m here to tell you today that I for one am no longer going to
fall into this trap. If the licensing labels offer their content to Yahoo! put
more barriers in front of the users, I’m not interested. Do what you feel you
need to do for your business, I’ll be polite, say thank you, and decline to
sign. I won’t let Yahoo! invest any more money in consumer inconvenience. I
will tell Yahoo! to give the money they were going to give me to build awesome
media applications to Yahoo! Mail or Answers or some other deserving
endeavor. I personally don’t have any more time to give and can’t bear to see
any more money spent on pathetic attempts for control instead of building
consumer value. Life’s too short. I want to delight consumers, not bum them
out.</p></blockquote>
<p>The whole article deserves a careful end-to-end read.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>China and the News</h2>
<p>Check out this piece of
<a href="http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=23924">remarkable insider
reporting</a> about another kind of “information management”.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Head Counts</h2>
<p>I got here through a chain of blogs that I’ve lost, but the last step was
John Rogers’
<a href="http://kfmonkey.blogspot.com/2006/03/farm-fetish.html">Farm

States of America, there are more World of Warcraft players than there are
working farmers.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Shocked, Angry, and Confused</h2>
<p>The Onion is uneven enough that I don’t read it all the time, but when
they’re good, they’re very good:

<p>What, you think terrorism isn’t a joke?  Neither does William Gibson, who

<title>Ups and Downs</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Everybody I know travels to China repeatedly it seems, but I haven’t for
a decade or more, and that was Hong Kong, so herewith the Shanghai-newbie
experience.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s a long way from Vancouver; a 12-hour flight.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I have lots of upgrade certificates.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, biz class filled up weeks ago.</p>
<p>Fortunately (depending on your viewpoint) there was a connection problem
and I got the second-last upgrade.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was an old Air Canada Boeing with the horrid seats that
cut off circulation to points below your thigh within minutes.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I know how to work around this with pillows and so on.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I had an aisle seat and I like to look out the window.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there was an empty window singleton.  Huh?  I thought biz
class was full?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the three empty seats in biz class were that way because
essential systems, like lean-back, or fail-to-randomly-lean back, were
broken.  Also about half the seats’ video systems were malfunctioning.  One
assumes the engines and so on were in better shape.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I had a sympathetic neighbor and that helped pass some of the
time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a bunch of jumbos landed simultaneously and I found myself
in an endless hallway with a countably-infinite number of people surging
toward immigration.</p>
<p>Fortunately, they had a countably-infinite number of immigration stations
and I was through in under five.  For a one-party state, arrival processing
is kind of cursory.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there were line-ups at all the bank machines.</p>
<p>Fortunately, things in Shanghai, while expensive by Chinese standards, are
still pretty reasonable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, to realize this, you have to deal with the fact that a
Canadian dollar is worth 7.77RMB more or less.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Shanghai airport is sanely and efficiently laid out and I was
in the taxi line in no time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, so were several hundred other people.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there were several hundred taxis pouring in to get us.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my taxi was a klunky old Volkswagen.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it had gleaming immaculate white cloth covering the back
seat.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that cloth completely covered the seat-belts, which couldn’t
be reached.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the driver didn’t turn on the TV monitor in the back of the
passenger seat.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the driver was a complete fucking madman, gleefully dicing
with death.</p> 
<p>Fortunately, he was a pretty good driver and a plurality (not a majority)
of the other drivers stayed more or less in their lanes most of the time, so I
arrived alive, and the fare was only 139RMB (divide that by 7.77 in your head,
I’m sure you can do it).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the sky was grey and lowering and the scenery between the
airport and downtown mostly pretty unprepossessing.</p> 
<p>Fortunately, the Shanghai Shangri-la is a lovely hotel, with competent
staff.  The quarter must be going great, Sun normally doesn’t patronize this
kind of place.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my room’s windows are filthy.  On the other hand I’m only on
the 8th floor and the view would be kind of grim if I could see it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this is one of the swankiest hotel rooms I’ve ever stayed in.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can’t find the controls for the curtains.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I have a few colleagues also rolling in tonight.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can’t find them, and I’m hungry, so I go downstairs to the
sushi bar.  For a guy from Vancouver, this is almost as egregious as going to
McDonald’s in Paris.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the sushi is excellent.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s expensive even after dividing by 7.77.</p>

and there’s a

translation</a> by Yamamoto Yohei (who’s
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/06/15/Cameras">appeared</a> in this space
before).
The Working Group
<a href="http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf-announce/current/msg04203.html">has
been closed</a>.  Good-bye.  This piece is something like the boring bit at
the end of a conference where they say all the thank-yous, but I do have some
news and ranting to spice things up.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Thank-Yous</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.bitworking.org/">Joe Gregorio</a> for having been the
first with the idea.  
<a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/">Sam Ruby</a>, for being the first
leader of the conspiracy.
<a href="http://lookit.typepad.com/">Paul Hoffman</a>, for steering us through
the IETF waters and keeping my worst impulses under control.
<a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/rob-sayre">Rob Sayre</a>,
<a href="http://www.mnot.net/">Mark Nottingham</a>, and
<a href="http://dehora.net/">Bill de hÓra</a>, for editing.  And all the other
people who struggled and labored away mightily on the Working Group, getting
the product out the door.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Shutting Down</h2>
<p>Ship 1.0, then shut down and go home, for a while at least.  This is the
correct course of action for a standards group.  Any other choice is
at best risky.  Trust me on this.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>What Next for Atompub?</h2>
<p>I dunno.  I think the world needs it.  Joe Cheng at Microsoft will
<a href="http://jcheng.wordpress.com/2007/10/16/how-wlw-speaks-atompub-part-1-autodiscovery/">code WLW</a>
to use the native WordPress API with WP, and various other native APIs with
other things, because they have more features than Atompub (see the comments).
If everyone is 
going to be willing to code their clients to work with every different set of
publishing-system idiosyncrasies, then Atompub will have been a waste of
time.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t seem plausible to me.</p>

<title>上海: Hidden Stories</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I have a lot of pictures, but not so many words, from Shanghai.  I’m
impressed but inarticulate because after four days on the ground, I’m mostly
mystified.  I’m old enough to have a few regrets, and among the sharpest is
that I’ve never taken the trouble to be really fluent in a language other than
English.  In particular, I am in awe of my colleagues who switch back and
forth between Mandarin and English three times in a sentence.  And everywhere
I look I see stories I’ll never know, because, first of all, how could I ever
get into a conversation with the woman on the back of the bicycle behind the
other woman on the bicycle, both of them laughing so hard they’re in danger of
swerving 
in front of a BMW?  And if I could, I wouldn’t understand the words.  And if I
did, I maybe still wouldn’t get the joke.  And there
are twenty million people here, that’s a lot of stories.</p>

<title>上海: Under Construction</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Shanghai really is.  They’ve built a mega-city in a young lifetime and
they’re not slowing down at all.</p>
<p>It seems to me a teenager among cities.  It’s big and strong and fast and
(kind of like Vancouver)
hasn’t begun to figure out what it wants to be when it grows up.</p>
<p>Of course, the standard news stories and pictures are all about all the
great big ninety-story towers, and they grab your eye all right, I was unable
to resist snapping a few.  Here’s one under construction.</p>

<title>Tech Days Talent</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’m here in Shanghai attending
<a href="http://developers.sun.com/events/techdays/">Sun Tech Days</a>.  This
is a soup-to-nuts show, everything from the operating system up to Web Tier
Orchestration.  I am definitely playing the wild-eyed-crazy
role in this production; my messages of radical openness and Web 2.0 inside-out
information flows and doing not necessarily Java-based Web development are a
little <em>outside</em> for this crowd, I think.
But they have something we don’t have at most of our New World tech shows: a
talent contest!</p>
<p>The prize was a lovely and only lightly Sun-branded black leather jacket.
There were six entries (one was a pair, so seven contestants).  These two came
off so close in the crowd voting that they both won.  (Warning, 20MB QuickTime).</p>

<p>They both got way more applause than I did.</p>
<p>Taken with the little Canon
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/04/27/Canon-A710-IS">A710 IS</a>.  I really don’t understand video.  When I asked iMovie to export this “for
the Web”, I got a horrible flickery jaggedy image, way worse than YouTube.
I fiddled the parameters but I don’t understand them and could only get it
down this small.  Back in 2004 I was
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/27/SonyMike">getting good quality</a> and

<title>上海: 430 km/h!</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>When I arrived, they’d said to take a taxi to the hotel so I
did, and the price was reasonable, but it was an hour of dice-with-death
Shanghai driving through not-very-exciting neighborhoods.  But then I found
out about the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Maglev_Train">MagLev train</a> to the airport.  It’s really fast, and the station
(a short taxi ride from the hotel) is totally all mod cons.  I lashed out for
the first-class ticket.</p>
<p>It was a grey day and Shanghai’s air isn’t the clearest at the best of
times.</p>
<img src="IMGP7077.jpg" alt="View from the MagLev train to Shanghai Airport"/>
<p>The ride from downtown to the airport is a big seven minutes.  That’s about 
2½ minutes of acceleration, a couple at top speed, and and another 2½ slowing
down.</p>
<img src="IMGP7082.jpg" alt="430 km/h!" />
<p>The sensation of speed is absolute.  The ride is smooth but not all
<em>that</em> smooth, and frankly, I found it kind of scary hitting bumps in
the track while banking around a
corner at 350 km/h.  Still, I was grinning like an idiot when I got to the
airport.  But then, I was going home too.</p>

<title>上海: After Dark</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The lights are bright in Shanghai at night, most places.</p>
<p>Here’s the front of the Jade Garden restaurant; we ate there and a good
time was had.
Notice something?  The sign’s mostly English, and the customers were a totally
random mix of locals and foreigners; it felt just like eating out in
Vancouver.  Shanghai is cosmopolitan and
don’t you forget it.  Compared to Tokyo, there are more foreigners, and more
people speak more languages.  Unlike Tokyo, people are happy and confident
trotting out their English even when it’s klunky.  Maybe it’s because they all
speak the local dialect and Mandarin too, just to get by.
It’s obvious the city is looking out as much
as it’s looking in.</p>
<img src="IMGP7060.jpg" alt="The Jade Garden restaurant, Shanghai" />
<p>Nanjing Road is an endless mostly-pedestrian shopping street with bright
lights all the way along.  It’s fun; we stopped at a chopsticks shop and
picked up some way-cool sets.</p>
<p>It could be better: there’s a really high density of Rolex/Montblanc touts
and people selling glow-in-the-dark gizmos and trinkets and various other
flavors of hustler, and they’re
aggressive and irritating.  Me, I’m large-ish and calm and rude when
necessary, and my wallet was in a zippered pocket, and I didn’t let it get to
me; but I can see some people getting 
really bent out of shape.</p>
<img src="IMGP7065.jpg" alt="Nanjing Road, Shanghai" />
<p>Also, there are nearly no buskers, which is a shortcoming on
a warm night’s stroll.  And nowhere to sit down and have a
beer or coffee or ice-cream and watch the people flow, which seems all
wrong to me.</p>
<p>Another evening we visited
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xintiandi">Xintiandi</a>, which is,
well, weird. 
It’s another walking street, not as bright or garish, tasteful brick
buildings on both sides, places to eat and drink all the way along, music
coming out of them;
more than half of the mostly sharp-dressed people strolling and eating are
foreigners. And there are 
no touts, so there must be enforcers lurking to keep the tone up.</p>
<p>We stopped for a drink in a place with a very competent multi-ethnic jazz
band.  The whole thing felt, I don’t know, colonial or like a gated community
or something.</p>
<p>That walk down Nanjing Road took us to the river’s edge.  
There were no streetlamps up on the embankment; sudden blackness after the
street’s glare, little pools of light from candyglow toys for sale and
the pungent food-stands’ charcoal, voices everywhere in the dark offering
knock-off watches and probably other sins.  And 
then the barges ghosting past on the Huangpu, dark and smooth and low between
us and the towers of Pudong.
Bright or dark, Shanghai never stops working.</p>

<title>All About Electric Text</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is not exactly a <em>review</em> of Yannis Haralambous’
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596102429?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=anyway-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0596102429">Fonts
&amp; Encodings</a>; that would be the work of years, and I doubt there’s
anyone in the world qualified to discuss the whole thing, except its author.
This new O’Reilly 
book is about a thousand pages in length.  It’s impossibly ambitious,
irritatingly flawed, and probably only comprehensible to a single-digit number
of thousands of people world-wide; but for those people it’s an essential
book, you just have to have it.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Language Shift</h2>
<p>I was most of the way through the 25-page Introduction, not having looked
at the front or back cover very carefully, and I thought “This is translated
from French.”  True enough, and fairly flowery French at that; for
example:</p>
<blockquote><p>For computerized typesetting is based on mechanical
typesetting, and the terms that we use today were invented by those people
whose hands were indelibly blackened, not with oil (the liquid that pollutes
our ecosystem), but with printer’s ink (the liquid that bears
wisdom).</p></blockquote>
<p>I spotted one little probably-in-translation problem: the discussion of XML
uses the term namespace <i>alias</i> rather than <i>prefix</i>.  Perhaps there
are others lurking in other arcane technical corners.  Still, this doesn’t
seem serious.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Scope</h2>
<p>Like the title says, more or less everything having anything to do with
digital text, its encoding, transmission, and presentation.  Most subjects are
accompanied by exhaustive historical background, which certainly make the book
more enjoyable even if they don’t increase its reference value.</p>
<p>Let’s see: Pre-Unicode; Unicode; Asian texts; Font management on Mac,
Windows, X Windows, in T<sub>E</sub>X, and on the Web; Classification of
typefaces and fonts; Editing and creating fonts; Optimizing rasterization;
Advanced Typography.  Then there are huge, immensely detailed appendices on
font formats ranging from T<sub>E</sub>X to TrueType, OpenType, and AAT.  Some
of these things I only barely knew existed, now I have all the details right
here on the bookshelf.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Organization</h2>
<p>The organization of this book is, frankly, weird.  The discussion of Unicode
starts with the encoding forms before it gets into the character repertoire
and planes.  The discussion of XML appears as a subset of the discussion of
SVG.  But the index seems competent, and as I said, more or less everything
appears somewhere or another, so this is bearable.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Praise</h2>
<p>The discussion of Unicode is pretty wonderful; the only instance I’ve seen
that actually improves on the Unicode spec itself.  I learned all sorts of
things I hadn’t known, and I’d thought of myself as fairly erudite on the
subject.</p>
<p>The discussion of font and typeface classification dives deep on a subject
I hadn’t even known existed.  Most people don’t know what
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PANOSE">Panose</a> is, and
most people who do, avoid thinking about it; the explanation here is clear and
straightforward.</p>
<p>But really, the best thing about the book is is breadth; it’s all here, and
it’s nice to have a book with all this stuff, even if it it isn’t all
perfect.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Irritants</h2>
<p>It’s not all perfect.  I can only criticize the parts I can understand, but
it’s not hard to find gripes.  The discussion of XML is cursory at best,
omitting the fact that its characters are by definition Unicode, or any
discussion of Draconian error-handling; these are two things that any serious
user of XML Needs To Know.</p>
<p>The discussion of Web typography seems pretty weak to me, too.  To start
with, it states, and then continues to assume, that CSS really only applies to
XHTML, which is simply wrong and dangerously misleading.
Then it invests a lot of space in various CSS properties which, it notes, are
not actually implemented by any browser.</p>
<p>Then there’s a lengthy discussion of font downloading, which in my
experience still lies way outside the mainstream, ending in a lengthy paean to
something called 
<a href="http://www.glyphgate.com/">GlyphGate</a> as the One True Ultimate
Path to good Web Typography.  Apparently it’s a proprietary server extension
that does some magic to enrich typography in your browser.  I’d never heard of
it, and I’m unimpressed by the Web site.</p>
<p>Some might find it irritating that the book invests hundreds of pages in
subjects and technologies (many T<sub>E</sub>X-related) that are really only
of historical interest, but I don’t see any harm in that.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Why Does It Matter?</h2>
<p>Go check out Rob Sayre’s recent
<a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/rob-sayre/2007/10/27/firefox-3-can-render-technology-correctly/">Firefox 3 Can Render Technology Correctly</a>,
which has a screenshot of a browser engaging in <em>[gasp!]</em> kerning.
Making the browser do this involves applying a combination of technologies
that are described in several hundred of this book’s pages, and, as far as I
know, not in one place anywhere else.  Speaking as one who
invested some hours hand-kerning the title over at 
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/">Textuality</a>, I appreciate why this
book needs to exist.</p>

<title>上海: Those Buildings</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I already noted that the really in-your-face thing about Shanghai 
is its forest of huge soaring buildings.  Enough pictures
have probably been taken, but I couldn’t resist adding a couple to the
collection.</p>
<p>The tallest is the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriental_Pearl_Tower">Oriental Pearl
Tower</a>.  I couldn’t decide which of these I liked better and decided to
damn the expense, bits is cheap.</p>
<img src="IMGP7048.jpg" alt="Shanghai skyscrapers and the Oriental Pearl Tower by night" />
<img src="IMGP7049.jpg" alt="Shanghai skyscrapers and the Oriental Pearl Tower by night" />
<p>Across the street from the base of the tower there’s an area full of
souvenir stalls and food stands.  One of them advertised “German Sausages” and
as I walked by, I found it staffed by two round-eyes
talking German to each other.  Full of surprises, Shanghai.</p>

<p>I haven’t been to China since the Nineties and that was Hong Kong, but I
remembered the special Hong Kong light.  There it was again in Shanghai, so
maybe it’s Chinese light, or at least South Chinese.</p>

was a pretty brutal storm and our drive out to

<p>Not for me, for a while anyhow.  It turns out that
<a href="http://duncandavidson.com/archives/630">Lightroom has

<a href="http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t102936.html">Java 5 is

it’s Unix under the covers and because all the UI and housekeeping is decent
and Just Works, not subtracting time from what matters.  But you know, the
largest single group of server-side software developers still lives in the Java
world, and they won’t be going to Leopard until Leopard comes to them.
Not, perhaps, a big demographic.  But an influential one I think.
<i>[Update: I’ve seen several contributions, for example 
<a href="http://www.symphonious.net/2007/10/31/java-5-on-leopard/">this from
Adrian Sutton</a>, saying that Java 5 on Leopard is just fine, thank you.
That’s a relief.]</i></p>

<title>上海: Shanghai City Temple</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>It’s near the famous
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuyuan_Garden">Yuyuan Garden</a>, in
the shopping district that surrounds it.  “It’s Old Shanghai”
<a href="http://today.java.net/pub/au/206">Doris</a> said of the area,
and she was right.</p>
<p>The 
<a href="http://www.shchm.org/">Temple’s Web site</a> has a pretty nice Flash
intro; I found its URI on the admission ticket.</p>
<img src="ticket.jpg" alt="City Temple of Shanghai Ticket" />
<p>It’s a nice little temple; I resisted the temptation to buy and burn some
incense, but enough people were that I had to time photos between clouds of
smoke.  There were lots of signs in several
languages telling people not to take their burning incense inside either the
cloister or the temple and they still had to have a guy sitting in a chair
full-time to yell at the people who did anyhow.</p>
<p>Here’s the main temple sanctuary and part of the skyline.</p>
<img src="IMGP7003.jpg" alt="Shanghai City Temple" />
<img src="IMGP7006.jpg" alt="Skyline of the Shanghai City Temple cloister" />
<p>Here are details of the wall paintings inside the main temple.  They’re
kind of blurry and dim; the poor old Pentax was being pushed to the max.</p>
<img src="IMGP6997.jpg" alt="Shanghai City Temple wall paintings" />
<img src="IMGP6998.jpg" alt="Shanghai City Temple wall paintings" />
<p>I’d say the neighborhood in general and the Temple in particular are worth
visiting if you’re in Shanghai.  The shopping district
around it is interesting but crowded and busy, and so were all my
pictures. Plus, of course, lots of opportunities to buy knock-off Rolexes.</p>

<title>WF XI: Results</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is the eleventh progress report from the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/20/Wide-Finder">Wide Finder Project</a>;
I’ll use it as the results accumulator, updating it in
place even if I go on to write more on the subject, which seems very
likely.
<i>[Update: Your new leader: Perl.]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Name</h2>
<p>There’ve been a few posts wondering about the name “Wide Finder”.  The
original Ruby code came from my <cite>Beautiful Code</cite> chapter called
“Finding Things”; thus it was a Finder.  The problem with modern CPUs is that
they’re getting wider not faster.  Thus, I seek a Wide Finder.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Worth Doing</h2>
<p>There is a steady drumbeat of commentary along the lines of “WTF? This is
a trivial I/O-bound hack you could do on the command line, ridiculously
inappropriate for
investigating issues of parallelism.”  To which I say “Horseshit”.  It’s an
extremely mainstream, boring, unglamorous file-processing batch job.  There’s
not the slightest whiff of IT Architecture or Social Networking or
Service-Orientation about it.  Well, that’s how lots of life is.
And the Ruby version runs faster on my Mac laptop than on the mighty
<a href="http://www.sun.com/servers/coolthreads/t5120/">T5120</a>.  <em>The
T5120 is what most of the world’s future computers are going
to look like!</em>  Houston, we have a problem, and the Wide Finder is a
useful lens to examine it.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>The Latest</h2>
<p><i>[2007/11/19]:</i> After a week or so off, I’m back to running Wide Finder code. First:
<a href="http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/~sorourke/wf.pl">Sean O’Rourke’s Perl
code</a>.</p>
<p>The good news is that it’s insanely fast; the bad news is that I had to visit
CPAN to get <code>Sys::Mmap</code>, and CPAN hates me.  Always has.  In this
case, the
<code>Makefile.PL</code> makes a Makefile that doesn’t work on Solaris, out of the
box until you
<a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2004/03/msg129994.html">mangle the incantations</a>.</p>
<p>I also ran
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/20/Wide-Finder#c1191526308.34746">Dave Thomas’ memory-mapped code</a>.</p>
<p>Neither the table’s format nor contents are carved in stone; I’m quite sure
I’ll update it as I pour more results in.  Are there any missing columns?  Or
outright broken-ness?  Feel
free to offer suggestions.</p>
<p>I still have a few Wide Finder implementations to run;
if you’ve done one and it doesn’t appear here, it couldn’t hurt to
drop me a line to make sure I know about it.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Results</h2>
<p>The data is essentially all of the <span class='o'>ongoing</span> logfile
from March of 2007; 971,538,252 bytes of data in 4,625,236 lines.  I will make
it available in compressed form to other experimenters on request, but I’ll
require you to convince me that you won’t publish it.</p>
<p>In each case, the benchmark was run at least twice, usually in succession
with other benchmarks, in an attempt to have the disk cache as hot as
possible.</p>
<p>This is a production T5120 with eight cores each at 1.4GHz and 64G of RAM.
It’s I/O performance is 
<a href="#p-12">unexciting</a>.</p>

<h2 id='p-8'>Variability</h2>
<p>The quantities in the cells marked “<code>*</code>” above exhibited a lot
of variability from run to run, sufficiently so as to make them probably
actively misleading to include.</p>
<h2 id='p-22'>Unknown</h2>
<p>The quantities in the cells marked “†” are unknown.  These multi-process
Erlang runs arrange for the absence of parent/child process relationships, so
it’s trickier to determine User and System CPU times.</p>
<h2 id='p-11'>Notes on Running Nygren’s wfinder7_2</h2>
<p>This is multi-process not multi-thread.  The best results are with 32
processes.</p>
<h2 id='p-9'>Notes on Running Nygren’s wfinder8</h2>
<p>Check out
<a href="http://www.trapexit.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=33437#33437">Anders’
notes</a>.
The number in parentheses is the value of the <code>+S</code> argument to
Erlang, telling it how many schedulers to run.  
Note that this is an 8-core
machine with two integer instruction threads per core and support for 
eight thread contexts per core.  Solaris thinks it sees 64 CPUs.
So if you don’t specify <code>+S</code> the default is 64, which seems about
right. </p>

<h2 id='p-7'>Notes on Running the wf-* Python Code</h2>
<p>This code is from Fredrik Lundh; see
<a href="http://effbot.org/zone/wide-finder.htm">his discussion</a>.
I added a number-of-processes command-line parameter to <code>wf-6.py</code>,
which appears in parentheses in the table above; so <code>wf-6(8)</code> means
running with eight processes.
I left the chunk size at 50M for now, this is just (just barely) small enough
to run with 16 processes.</p>
<p>Fredrik took a glance and suggested removing <code>wf-3</code> through
<code>wf-5</code> in the interests of making the table more readable.</p>
<p>The reporting of user and system CPU time was wildly variable.
For example, <code>wf-6(8)</code> reported user CPU as low as 
5.06 seconds and as high as 31.99 seconds.  I suspect that this may be worth
bringing to the attention of the Solaris people; the state of the art in
tracking CPU usage in this fairly exotic type of machine is still a little
shaky, apparently.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Analysis</h2>
<p><em>Are you kidding me!?!?</em>  Getouttahere.  Maybe someday.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Previous News</h2>
<p><i>[2007/10/30]:</i> I’ve been back from Shanghai for a few days now, but
it took till past lunch today to get logged into the mighty T5120 and doing
some Wide Finding.  It’s a pretty naked Solaris box, and compiling all this
stuff has been just a bundle of fun.  Not.</p>
<p><i>[2007/10/31]:</i> Added a Lines-of-Code column to the table.
Ran Fredrik Lundh’s multi-process Python, Ilmari Heikkinen’s OCaml, and Russ
Beattie’s PHP.  There are a few that I’ve tried and failed to run; Erlang code
that won’t compile, C and JoCaml code that will compile but not run.  In each
case I’ve pinged the author, and I may go back and try to see if I can sort
things out.</p>
<p><i>[2007/11/01]:</i> Got Pichi’s patched Erlang to run.  545 lines, wow!.
Caoyuan’s too, much more concise, but not as fast.</p>
<p><i>[2007/11/01]:</i> Did some runs with Nygren’s <code>wfinder8</code>;
details 
<a href="#p-9">here</a>.</p>
<p><i>[2007/11/04]:</i> Per advice from contributors below, I installed
<a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable/">sorttable</a> and
it seems to work just fine!.</p>
<p><i>[2007/11/05]:</i> I ran Caoyuan’s latest; notes 
<a href="#p-10">here</a>.</p>
<p>Then I ran Mauricio Fernandez’ OCaml and JoCaml; see
<a href="http://eigenclass.org/hiki.rb?fast-widefinder">Aim for the Top! Beating the current #1 Wide Finder log analyzer with the join-calculus</a>.
<strong>Holy crap!</strong>  I have to say that the OCaml build/run process
is kind of klunky, this isn’t your classic REPL by any means.  But you know,
this isn’t the first time that I’ve seen OCaml thump the competition on a
benchmark; it’s just the first time that it was a benchmark I cared about.</p>
<p><i>[2007/11/08]:</i> I ran Eric Wong’s
<a href="http://normalperson.com/widefinder">Perl code</a> (notes
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/10/30/WF-Results#c1194177382.797923">here</a>);
kind of disappointing.</p>
<p>Then I ran Anders Nygren’s revised 
<a href="#p-11">wfinder7_2</a>; he writes: “The difference compared to wfinder8 is that this one does not use the SMP
virtual machine. Instead it starts a number of slave erlang nodes.”</p>
<p>Caoyuan revised his <code>tbray9</code> to produce <code>tbray9a</code>,
requesting that I replace the results.</p>
<p><i>[2007/11/09]:</i> Russ Beattie revised his PHP code, renaming it
<code>widefinder3</code>, and indeed, it moved a few places up the table.</p>
<p>Also, based on several requests about this box’s I/O performance, I did a
<a href="#p-12">Bonnie run</a>, which is kind of interesting.</p>
<h2 id='p-12'>I/O</h2>
<p>There have been appeals, both in the comments and in email, for a
characterization of the test box’s I/O performance.  I ran
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Software#p-1">Bonnie</a> with the following
results:</p>
<pre><code>
     -------Sequential Output-------- ---Sequential Input-- --Random--
     -Per Char- --Block--- -Rewrite-- -Per Char- --Block--- --Seeks---
  GB M/sec %CPU M/sec %CPU M/sec %CPU M/sec %CPU M/sec %CPU  /sec  %CPU
  20  23.9 99.7  41.5 29.8  44.2 61.8  22.3  100 161.8  100 21835 239.4
</code></pre>
<p>Given that this stupid thing has 64G of RAM and I could only find 20G of
disk space to work with, the results should be taken with a grain of salt
(especially the Random Seeks number).  Having said that, watching the
free-memory readout made it look to me as though
when it was doing the sequential runs, it was doing real I/O, not just
caching.</p>
<p>Note that when it says “100% CPU”, that means 100% of one of the 64 logical
CPUs that Solaris sees on this box. And in fact, it looks to me that doing C
I/O on this box pegs one of the cores, whether you’re using
<code>getc()</code> or <code>read()</code>.</p>

<title>Censoring Homer</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Our son, now eight, can read perfectly well (in three languages) but still
requires a bedtime story, which is OK because Lauren and I both enjoy reading
them.  Given the fact that he can now read all the cheesy pictorials he likes
for himself, I’ve been enforcing Big Serious Books.  So recently it’s been the
Odyssey, which actually hasn’t worked out that well.</p>
<p>I picked the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T.E._Lawrence">T.E. Lawrence</a> prose
translation (signed “Shaw” of course) 
because I’m a Lawrence cultist, and it’s not perfect, but that’s not the
problem.  The problem is that large parts of Homer are boring and other large
parts are horrendously violent and still other large parts are sexually
explicit.  So maybe it wasn’t the best choice.  On the other hand, it’s been
good mental exercise as I have to compose real-time alternatives to unsuitable
Homer.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Boring</h2>
<p>Sometimes my internal mental commentary has a Marge-like tone: “Homie,
didn’t you already say he was ‘God-like’ three times two pages ago?”  Plus
then there are the endless boring irrelevant voyages of Telemachus off to here
and there to no particular purpose.  These are fairly easily dealt with by
saying “I’m gonna skip a few boring pages here”.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Sex</h2>
<p>There are quite a few scenes along the lines of “The Nymph looked upon
Odysseus’ comely limbs and said ‘Mortal, I will grant you life only if you
become my bed-mate and delight me with the joys of nightly love.’”  Dealt
with reasonably easily by substituting “... be my husband” for the second
half.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Brutish Violence</h2>
<p>There’s not that much until Odysseus gets home among his wife’s suitors,
and then there’s a lot.  With detailed descriptions of exactly what happens to
you when you get an arrow through the throat or a spear through the thorax
from behind.
Later, I said to the boy “They weren’t the nicest, but they
probably didn’t deserve <em>that</em>” and he said “Well, they <em>sort
of</em> did.”</p>
<p>What bothered me was the the obvious fact that Odysseus cut ’em down in
the dining hall not so much because they were wooing his wife as because they
were eating his livestock and screwing his housemaids.</p>
<p>Which leads me to the
nastiest bit of all.  After Odysseus has finally made it home and slaughtered
the suitors, he quizzes his elderly ex-nanny Eurycleia as to exactly which of
the house-women have been getting it on with them. She fingers twelve of fifty
and he orders that they be put to work clearing up his bloody mess and
then immediately put to death.  OK, dealt with by slipping in “punish them”
for “slaughter them with your long swords till the last life is spent and
their love-passages with the suitors are wholly out of mind.”</p>
<p>Odysseus delegated to his son Telemachus, who said “It irks me to give any
sort of clean death to women who have heaped shame on my head and my mother’s,
and have wantoned with the suitors” and arranged it thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>He made fast a dark-prowed ship’s hawser to a pillar and
strained it around the great spiral of the vault, at too great a height for
anyone to touch the floor with her feet.  Sometimes in a shrubbery men so
stretch out nets, upon which long-winged thrushes or doves alight on their way
to roost: and fatal the perch proves.  Exactly thus were the women’s heads all
held a-row with a bight of cord drawn round each throat, to suffer their
caitiff’s death.  A little while they twittered with their feet—only a
little.  It was not long.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you read the collected letters of T.E. Lawrence (which I recommend, a
truly interesting person), you discover that he took on the Homer translation
to make some money when he needed it, struggled with it, and totally hated
both Odysseus and Telemachus by the time he was done.  I agree, and I’ve read
lots of translations.</p>
<p>And I hated Eurycleia too, the old bitch; all she had to do was tell a few
harmless lies and those young women who’d gone with the flow might have skated
through, and they’d have been truly sorry and might have become
better people.</p>
<p>“Hold on,” you say, “this is 2,700-year-old <em>fiction</em>”.  Well, yeah,
but Homer was (despite the oral-poetry tropes) a good storyteller with a
good story, and T.E. Lawrence was a good translater, and it’s impossible
not to care.  I wonder which of our current authors will be exciting this kind
of passion around A.D. 4700?</p>
<p>So, sitting up with the boy on his bed as we usually do, I scanned ahead,
paused, and said (thank goodness for the “dark-prowed ship” suggestion)
“... put them on a ship and sent them out to sea”.</p>
<p>Which at the end of the day may have been cowardice.  Children are entirely
unsentimental and know perfectly well that this story happened a long time ago
and a long way away, and maybe could have dealt with it just fine.  But I
retreated to the comforting lie.</p>

<title>Good Tech Writing</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Two of my browser tabs contain pieces that are related in that
they are very well-written, and about technology.</p>
<p>Stephen Fry, British author
and actor, recently burst into blogging with sufficient force that he scored a
Guardian column (which is conveniently reproduced on
<a href="http://stephenfry.com/blog/">the blog</a>).  The opening salvo,
<a href="http://stephenfry.com/blog/?p=22">Welcome to dork talk</a>, is a
pleasure to read, end to end.</p>
<p>Mark Bernstein, the
<a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a> guy, is working on
a series called
<a href="http://markbernstein.org/NeoVictorian.html">NeoVictorian
Computing</a> which, while perhaps not quite as elegantly-turned-out as Fry’s
<i>œuvre</i>, digs a little deeper.  He is making a direct appeal for
software to adopt the principles of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arts_and_Crafts_movement">Arts and
Crafts Movement</a>.  Since I am writing this sitting in a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Stickley">Stickley</a> chair in a
wooden house in the A&amp;C style, I’m inclined to be sympathetic.  Mark’s
message resists summarization, so I won’t try.  His NeoVictorian page is
organized in a blog style, so you have to go there, scroll down to find the
first article, read it, then scroll up to read the next, and so on.  Mark:
consider flipping it.</p>

<title>上海: Yuyuan Garden</title>

<body>
<p>Established,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuyuan_Garden">it is said</a>, in 1559.
Odd, but good.</p>
<p>Here’s the ticket you buy to get in:</p>
<img src="garden-ticket.jpg" alt="Admission ticket for Yuyan Garden in Shanghai" />
<p>I have four pictures, only one of which includes any vegetation.  As
gardens go, this has nice buildings.</p>

<img src="IMGP7031.jpg" alt="In Yuyuan garden, Shanghai" />
<p>I was there on a weekday afternoon and so were many other tourists.  Still,
there are lots of places to sit down. With a bit of poking around, you can
even find something in an out-of-the-way corner for a quiet conversation; only
I was alone.</p>
<p>I skulked along behind a French-language tour group for a while to soak up
some of the finer historical and architectural points, and found that quite a
bit of value was added.  Also in evidence: Italian, Spanish, Korean, and lots
of Chinese.</p>
<p>Also, there are a handful of gift shops scattered around, these would be
fixed-price government gift shops, quite unlike the grubby shopping
neighborhood immediately outside.  I got a really-quite-nice tablecloth made
by an ethnic minority whose name I neglected to note, and a jade pendant.  I
was quite taken by some huge prints that combined Chinese and modern-art
sensibilities, but they’d have been hard to take home and then hard to find a
place to hang.  Oh well.</p>

<title>My Indiana</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Well,
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/marchamilton/entry/opensolaris_developer_preview_is_almost">Indiana
is here</a>.  I got it running on my Ultra 20, which is unsurprising as that’s
all-Sun hardware.  Default userland: GNU.  Default shell: Bash.  I feel right
at home.
There are issues, but this is progress in a good direction.</p>
<img src="Indiana.png" alt="OpenSolaris Developer Preview screenshot" />
<p>The distro is amazingly smooth for a first pre-alpha preview, and it’s
definitely got that 
GNU/Solaris flavor which I’ve repeatedly argued has an attractive future.  I
filed two bugs: Grub couldn’t see the the bootable Ubuntu and Windows in the
other partitions, and Firefox (but not the system utilities) uses horrid jaggy
bleed-from-the-eyeballs un-anti-aliased fonts.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>[Flame on]:</i> Why the bloody hell is every operating
system, including Ubuntu from which I expect better, so inexcusably lame in
dealing with disk partitions?  The Indiana distro overwrote my MBR.  Well,
that ought to be a transient irritant, every LiveCD distro ought to have some
sort of one-liner which says “Here are the partitions; tell me which ones you
think ought to be bootable and I’ll set things up for you.”  I spent a good
half-hour arguing with <code>fdisk</code> and <code>grub</code> on the latest
Ubuntu LiveCD to get them to do the obviously right thing.
Bah.</p></blockquote> 
<h2 id='p-1'>The Best Bit</h2>
<p>The #1 problem in Solaris, from a developer’s point of view, has been
the absence of
something that does what Debian’s magical <code>apt-get</code> does.  Sun
insiders including me have been browbeating the Solaris engineering group
over this for years.  They considered adopting <code>apt</code> and decided
they could build something better; it’s called
<a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/pkg/documents/">IPS</a>.
I think they might be onto something, although I wonder why it needs two
names, “ips” and “pkg”.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, there’s all that DTrace/Zones/ZFS/SMF Solaris goodness, but that
was assumed. You have to go through the userland to get there, which is why
Indiana matters.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Problems</h2>
<p>There are some people in the community who are really pissed that Indiana’s
name includes “OpenSolaris”, arguing that the right way to encourage an
ecosystem of OpenSolaris-kernel-based distros is to be super-careful about how
you use the name “OpenSolaris”.
On the other hand, “Where can I download OpenSolaris?” is a
reasonable question that ought to have an answer, and some feel that the
proliferation of Linux distros is a bug not a feature.  So this is a
reasonable argument to have.</p>
<p>There are others (they get no sympathy from me) who are livid because
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash">bash</a> is the
default user shell, and because <code>/usr/gnu</code> is at the front of the
default user path.  Well, excuse me, one goal of the exercise is to make
Solaris interesting to people who haven’t been using it, and most of those
people have been living in GNU/bash territory for their entire working lives,
and think that’s how Things Ought To Be.  The good bits of Solaris don’t
include its  userland or its shell.
Anyone who knows enough to care will have no trouble switching to back to
their POSIX-compliant hair shirt.</p>

<title>上海: Shanghai Wrapup</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Miscellaneous pictures and thoughts to wrap up the Shanghai series.
These should be taken very lightly, based as they are on a big four days
of jet-lagged reportage.</p>
<img src="IMG_0537-Edit.jpg" alt="Aerial view near Shanghai" />
<div class="caption"><p>From the low approach into Shanghai airport.</p></div>
<p>It’s impossible not to be impressed.  You look at the towers,
and more springing up, and you realize the money didn’t come from what they
pump out of the ground, but from building stuff for the rest of the world to
use.  Speaking as an investor, I’m trying to think of a way to bet a few bucks
on China in general.  The stock market and corruption and political threats
have to scare you; maybe you could do worse than just buy a bunch of RMB and
put them under your bed.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>On Biz</h2>
<p>Going over and back, I sat next to a Canadian
businessperson on a trip to work with Chinese colleagues.
In both cases, things were going well, although there was a
continuous fight with quality problems, with cultural gaps, and with workforce
retention. Even the bright-faced happy-news English city paper had a story one
morning about how
people in white-collar jobs stay at each one for an average of less
than two years.  One reason, I suspect, is that most businesses don’t give the
most rewarding and exciting work to the Chinese end of their operation.</p>
<img src="IMGP7035.jpg" alt="The big mall in Pudong, Shanghai" />
<div class="caption"><p>Inside the big mall in Pudong.</p></div>
<p>Pardon me, I’m just a country boy from Alberta, but I can’t help feeling 
some cognitive dissonance; on one side all this free-enterprise energy and
on the other
its context, which is, after all, a Stalinist dictatorship; the big Party
Congress wrapped up while I was there and I watched on TV as Mr. Hu trotted
out his new front bench; they formed a rigid line in identical dark suits,
red ties, and poker faces.  Spookily just like they used to line up on the
podium in Red Square in Moscow.</p>
<p>I found people remarkably free in talking about politics.  Mostly 
I talked to geeks, of course; they laughed at the Great Firewall
(finding a proxy to get around it is no big deal) but were livid with fury
about how if you want to put up a web-site, you have to get approval from
three different ministries, and then you might get a call from another saying
“You need our approval too”.</p>
<p>I don’t know, doesn’t seem tenable to me in the long term.</p>
<p>There was a kind of strange article in <cite>The Economist</cite> recently, 
<a href="http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9944703&amp;CFID=19280663&amp;CFTOKEN=13203724">A workers’ manifesto for China</a>.
I’ll quote: “It is widely agreed that China needs to rebalance its economy in
favour of consumption and away from exports.”  I won’t reproduce the arguments
but they’re sensible.</p>
<p>There follows a lot of analysis which twists this way
and that to avoid its own obvious conclusion: they need to pay people better.
What China actually needs is some decent labour laws and bloody-minded unions
to drive up wages so that people will have some RMB in their pockets and you
can get some of that consumption happening, and then some human-intensive
service industries.  That sector doesn’t really start to happen until you’ve
got the basics of life and you can start to splurge on counselors and
hairdressers and auto tuners and wedding planners and brewpub operators and
yoga instructors and so
on.  I’d say what China needs (and I know this is going to sound weird) is a
little more, um, socialism.  This, of course, is a conclusion that the
<cite>Economist</cite> is institutionally incapable of coming to; even though
their headline-writer did.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>On Culture</h2>
<p>China exports computers and dolls and toasters and transformers and
Transformers and tables and chairs and shirts and skirts.  But it doesn’t
export any culture.  North America and Japan and Britain and France and
Germany and Italy export rock &amp; roll and Pokemon and Harry
Potter and fine cuisine and automotive design and opera singers.
I haven’t the faintest kind of idea what kind of culture China is going to
export once it grows up a little more and figures out what it wants to be.</p>
<img src="IMGP7019.jpg" alt="Sign: Tower of Happiness, Hall of Mildness" />
<p>China, bearing in mind that dictatorship thing, is amazingly open.  When I
stopped by the bank machine in the airport for some RMB, the dialogue was in a
language somewhat but not completely unlike English, opening with “Please dip
your card” and continuing in a slightly-crazed but cheery conversational tone
in which the machine referred to itself as “I”.</p>
<p>But hey, it worked fine, and someone obviously hadn’t stressed
out about the finer points, they’d pulled it together with the English they
had, and I got my money, and then I went and spent a bunch of it.
This is an attitude I respect.</p>
<p>The Huangpu river curves between Shanghai and Pudong, and there are boats
moving the things China makes, and whatever it makes them out of, going up and
down it all the time.  Also a few party boats, and also billboard boats, with
these huge neon pixel-boards lit up with advertising.  Here’s a shot through the
thick, tinted, not-so-clean window of my hotel rom.</p>
<img src="IMGP7042.jpg" alt="Video advertising billboard boat on the Huangpu in Shanghai" />
<p>There are political and business issues to sort out, for sure, but there’s
a lot of imagination waiting to happen.</p>

regarded as a CS-research toy, totally wiped the carpet with all other
contenders.  Near the top is a thread-oblivious implementation in
Python, a language with no particular concern for concurrency.  What do you
think?  If your thoughts are material, write ’em in your own space and link

I do have one specific question, which I hope to address at length: <i>Which of

chance when I had to free up one arm for a door; feinted left, squirmed right,
plunged her hand all the way into the ruby
red, and beamed triumphantly.  I’d just finished wiping dinner off it
so with no hesitation I stuffed the wiggly pink dripping
fingers into my mouth.  The wine tasted good off her warm skin, oddly
different but good.  I recommend this.</p>

<title>PyPy</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Yesterday I got a pitch from Laura Creighton, Samuele Pedroni (who’s
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/08/DynamicJava">appeared
here before</a>) and the rest of the
<a href="http://codespeak.net/pypy/">PyPy</a> team. </p>
<p>They’ve defined RPython, a Python subset, and they have a translator (I’d
call it a compiler) that can translate RPython programs into object language or
Java bytecodes.  PyPy itself is an RPython program that implements Python;
they claim to have pretty well all of 2.4, and think they can approach
performance parity.</p>
<p>It’s all Open Source of course, MIT license.</p>
<p>They also have some neat object-proxying tricks which they use to do things
like give Python a “taint” capability.</p>
<p>The core idea is this: Use RPython to implement your favorite dynamic
language, rather than C.  Such an 
implementation ought to be immensely more flexible and maintainable; simply
because Python is immensely more flexible and maintainable than C.</p>
<p>At the moment, they’re looking for someone to fund continued work on
applying PyPy to, well, any language you can think of.  I might be interested
in supporting work on Ruby; hey, there are already four credible alternative
implementations working in parallel, why not make it five?  Others might be
interested in looking at PHP or, well, who knows...  Do you depend on a dynamic
language whose implementation you’re not crazy about?</p>

two doors down to Sekora’s Classical, and it’s probably been a year, and what
a shame.  I hadn’t intended to go shop but dropped $162 in about fifteen
minutes.</p>
<p>Let’s see,
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Anne-Sofie-von-Otter-Berlioz/dp/B000001GOS">von
Otter singing Berlioz</a>; normally I don’t
care that much for either, but they were playing it on the audio system and
it’s great, and a real deal for $9 used.</p>
<p>Then, the big
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bach-Stokowski-Johann-Sebastian/dp/B000002S9M">Stokowski Bach transcriptions</a>, remastered.  Yeah,
the whole original-instruments movement was launched in some part in horrified
revulsion with this stuff, but if you unclench and enjoy it for what it is, it’s
great fun.  I mean, if you liked the Clash that doesn’t mean you had to hate
Deep Purple, right?</p>
<p>There was one failure, a live recording of Richter playing
Chopin; how could you go wrong?  Well, you could.</p>
<p>Two that I haven’t even listened to yet: <cite>Alina</cite> by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvo_P%C3%A4rt">Pärt</a>,
(<em>three</em> versions of <cite>Spiegel im Spiegel</cite>!) and Steve Reich
and Musicians live from 1977.</p>
<p>Finally, the day’s best catch:
<a href="http://www.nonesuch.com/Hi_Band/albums.cfm?album_num=643">The Dharma
at Big Sur</a> by 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Coolidge_Adams">John Adams</a> with
the composer conducting and Tracy Silverman on electric violin in front of the
BBC Symphony, which I’d wanted since hearing it on the radio.  It’s magic; not
sure if it falls in the
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/What/Arts/Music/5%20Stars/">5★</a>
category yet, but I’ve listened to it end-to-end two or three times.  I’m not
gong to try to describe it, but along with being challenging and aggressive,
it’s awfully pretty.</p>

<title>Thinking About Cameras</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’ve been shooting with the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/04/27/Pentax-P-DA-40mm">40mm pancake</a>
almost exclusively for a half-year now, and I’m not going to stop, but I’m
really itching for something better.</p>
<p>If you read the comments on that pancake link above, they say smart things,
and others have written about the virtues of running with a prime (no-zoom)
lens.  Let me pull together my personal list.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Compact</h2>
<p>My aged Pentax *ist-D is smallish and lightish as DSLRs go, and the
pancake is small and light by any standards.  I can easily hold the combo with
one hand for an hour at a time as I walk around and shoot.  Also I get to
tease the other photogeeks with their huge swollen Canon lenses by waving my
diminutive setup around airily as they struggle with monopods and the straps
around their necks cut off circulation to their brains.</p>
<img src="IMGP6350.jpg" alt="Lynn Valley forest" />
<div class="caption"><p>On a tricky Lynn Valley trail walk</p></div>
<p>I’m using Lauren’s old camera bag, a beat-up looking canvas thingie
designed to hold an SLR with a big zoom.  Except for, in the bulge where the
zoom is supposed to go I have my flash-card reader and the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/05/24/Pentax-SMC-DA-21mm">21mm
wide-angle</a>, and the whole package is light.  I do sometimes wonder, for
example when stopped by a busy street in Shanghai changing lenses, what would
be so bad about using a zoom, but dammit, Art demands Sacrifice, everybody
knows that.</p>
<p>Another side-effect of the diminutive setup is that I now take the SLR
along on lots of trips I wouldn’t have, before.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Fast</h2>
<p>Because I don’t have to think about the zoom, I can shoot more pictures per
unit time.  Yeah, I have to compose with my whole body, but these days,
composition is less important because I’m gonna level and crop in Lightroom
anyhow.</p>
<img src="IMGP6122.jpg" alt="Berlin sunset" />
<div class="caption"><p>Shot quick in Berlin</p></div>
<h2 id='p-4'>Intimate</h2>
<p>It’s like this; after six months of working with this puppy, I totally
<em>know</em> the field of view.  When I look at something maybe-interesting,
I find that my mind is automatically figuring out what’s going to fit and what
isn’t.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Insensitivity</h2>
<p>Life isn’t perfect: this setup is just not sensitive enough.  I want the
lens to be faster and I want anti-shake and I want the image processor to
produce images that are smooth as butter at ISO 1600 and above.  Basically, I
want a Nikon D3, only half the size.</p>
<p>These days, for indoor shots at conferences at the like, I shoot on manual,
hardwired to ISO 400 or 800, 1/60 of a second, and <i>f</i>2.8.  They’re
mostly a little underexposed, but with the judicious application of Lightroom
I can get some decent effects.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Matz keynoting; the camera is being pushed a little
further than it really wants to go, with obvious results.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-6'>Shiny New Toy?</h2>
<p>Hmm, check out the
<a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2007/10/new-gr-digital-.html">new
Ricoh GR Digital II</a>.  Everyone loved the ergonomics and lens quality and
general artfulness of its predecessor, but its low-light performance was
wildly controversial.  Some of the controversy even showed up in
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/02/25/High-End-Compact-Cameras#comments">the
comments on an earlier piece</a>.</p>
<p>This puppy is said to offer “dramatically” improved high-ISO performance,
which sounds very interesting. Mind you, the company’s
<a href="http://www.ricoh.com/r_dc/gr/gr_digital2/sampleimage.html">demo
images</a> are all shot at ISO 100; grmph.  No anti-shake, though.</p>
<p>Hey, I’m going to be in Tokyo next week; staying in Shinjuku this time too,
which is a good camera-shopping district.  Hmmmm.</p>

<title>WF XIII: Logistical Pain</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is the thirteenth progress report from the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/20/Wide-Finder">Wide Finder Project</a>.
It’s just scratchpad to catalogue all the problems I’ve had getting contributed
code to work.  Probably not of general interest, but an essential part of a
complete write-up.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Java</h2>
<p><i>[2007/11/19]: </i>Actually, disregard most of the following; there’s
something horribly wrong with this computer.  Whenever I spin up a big Java
job of any sort, everything locks up, the computer won’t even ping.  
Working on it...</p>
<p>CB’s
<a href="http://unintentionalobjectretention.blogspot.com/2007/10/disk-caching-and-file-splitting.html">Java code</a>
causes the computer to just lock up while it goes away and grinds for minute
after minute.  But only on the big file, not smaller test files.  WTF?!
It bothers me not to have Java in this study, so I may have to write something
myself.</p>
<p>Now I have another Java attempt, but it produces wildly incorrect results.
I’ve pinged the author, but I’m definitely seeing some Java coding in my
future.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Lisp</h2>
<p>I couldn’t get Irate Nate’s
<a href="http://www.method-combination.net/blog/archives/2007/09/29/wide-finder-in-lisp.html">Lisp
code</a> to run; SBCL ran into some problem installing <code>cl-pcre</code>,
with completely incomprehensible error messages.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>C++</h2>
<p>I can’t get 
<a href="http://www.lug.corvallis.or.us/drupal/node/102">Bob Miller’s C++
code</a> to compile.  Any experts out there with a clue?  I’m
reminded why it is that I’ve always hated C++.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Haskell</h2>
<p>GHC Haskell won’t build on Solaris:</p>
<pre><code>sca12-3200a-40 ~/n2/ghc-6.8.1/> ./configure
checking build system type... sparc-sun-solaris2.10

./configure: line 2177: utils/pwd/pwd: No such file or directory
configure: error: cannot determine current directory</code></pre>
<h2 id='p-5'>Scala</h2>
<p>I still don’t have a Scala version that takes the form of a .jar or
something I can actually run.</p>
<p>OK, as of Nov. 19th I do, but Martin Probst’s <code>.jar</code> file seems
to be sliding into CLASSPATH hell, can’t seem to see the
<code>scala-library</code> classes.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>PHP</h2>
<p>I’d like to run
<a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2007/11/01/wide-finder-in-errr-php">Harry
Fuecks’ PHP</a>, but this computer is sitting behind a firewall proxy’d to the
max, and getting Apache <em>and</em> PHP <em>and</em> the necessary connective
tissue all installed and running is just a major pain in the butt.  I’ll try
to get to it though.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>Erlang</h2>
<p>Steve Vinoski’s last effort silently locks up, 
grinds away without making any progress.  This is really unfair to Steve,
since essentially all the really good entries are basing their code on ideas
he was the first to cook up.</p>

<title>Camera Futures</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Following on
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/11/09/Thinking-About-Cameras">Thinking About
Cameras</a> and the smart things in
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/11/09/Thinking-About-Cameras#comments">its comments</a>, here are some
conclusions and a prediction.</p>
<h2 id='p-10'>Prediction</h2>
<p>These are electronics-driven consumer goods, right?  Given that, the future
is obvious:  Inside another decade, you’ll be able to get something with the
specs of the mighty D3 and it’ll fit in your pocket.</p>
<h2 id='p-9'>My Sensitivity Problem</h2>
<p>I’m sorry that I went for a few years without comments on the blog.  I got
emails of course, but not as many, and sharing them with the world was extra
work.</p>
<p>Clearly the GR-D2 is an interesting camera; but probably not something
that’ll solve my shooting-inside problem.  If they’re actually out on the
street in Japan and one jumps out in front of me as I walk through Shinjuku, I
might give in.</p>
<p>For the low-light problem, there are some useful incremental steps to take.
First, I could upgrade my old *ist D to a current K10D or K100D, both of which
have shake reduction.  The K100D is more or less exactly the same form factor
and weight, which is good; the K10D adds a few pixels and weatherproofing and
so on, at a fairly moderate size/weight cost.</p>
<p>Then, there’s a faster lens.  The obvious candidates would be Pentax’s
<a href="http://www.pentaximaging.com/products/product_details/camera_lens--smc_P-FA_43_mm_F1.9_Limited/reqID--3016/subsection--Digital_35mm_standard">43mm
1.9</a> or Sigma’s
<a href="http://sigmaphoto.com/lenses/lenses_all_details.asp?id=3300&amp;navigator=6">30mm
1.4</a>.  Mind you, the Sigma is almost as heavy as the whole Pentax body.
But maybe that’s OK; this is a special-purpose lens, for shooting children and
colleagues, not the kind of thing you’d walk around a city with.</p>
<p>Finally, one could just go completely fucking nuts and pick up a D3.</p>

<title>Bad Ruby</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I enjoyed attending 
<a href="http://rubyconf.org/agenda.html">RubyConf</a> immensely, but I also
regretted it.  Not all is well in my personal favorite open-source
community.  (This article is full of complaints; for my love-letter on the
same subject see
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/11/12/Good-Ruby">here</a>.)
<i>[Ouch, check the comments.  My position on weekends is, um, not universally
held.]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-1'>This Is Serious</h2>
<p>Look, dammit, Ruby isn’t an insurgency or a conspiracy or a party, it’s a
profession and a vocation and we’re getting getting paid for doing it.  So why
the flaming hell are we meeting on weekends like Trekkies
or scrapbookers?</p>
<p>I have both a vocation and a family, which is a tough row to hoe at the
best of times.  Here’s my son last Oct. 31st, whom I spent a weekend away from
in Charlotte, NC, hanging with geeks. You can see his real eyes through the
holes in the mask and it’s never good when I have to look into them
and why I can’t read him his bedtime stories or throw a football
because I have to go to Charlotte or Tokyo or Shanghai.</p>
<img src="IMGP7093.jpg" alt="Boy in hallowe’en costume" />
<div class="caption"><p>Ain’t he cute?</p></div>
<p>An essential part of my compromise is that I
may work insane hours and have to cross oceans too often, but at least I’m in
the house on the weekend.  Only the Ruby community thinks it’s OK to blow that
up.
They’re actively discriminating against people with lives and families and  
they’re wrong.  Let’s start acting like grown-ups.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Transpacific Language Gap</h2>
<p>Check out Charles Nutter’s
<a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/2007/11/ruby-community-seeks-autotranslator.html">Ruby Community Seeks Autotranslator</a>.
Charles is pointing at a great big hairy elephant in the room that nobody
mentions; core Ruby development is done in Japan, in Japanese.
<em>Gaijin</em> are not really in the loop.  Look in the mirror: Rails
development is done in English and any Japanese Rubyists who want to play have
to do it in English.  Ruby
isn’t one community, it’s two, and we don’t talk enough.
Both are nice, and we get along just fine, and Matz does an amazingly good job
of straddling the divide, but let’s not pretend it doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>Charlie proposes applying a good auto-translator.  In my dreams, we find
someone who’s fluently bilingual and who wants to contribute to the community
by translating both ways.  But a semi-decent automated tool would be a step
forward.  Any volunteers?</p>
<img src="IMGP7112.jpg" alt="Werewolf players at RubyConf" />
<div class="caption"><p>Werewolf game at RubyConf; Japanese
not being spoken.</p></div>
<p>Which brings me to the third point, also raised by Mr. Nutter.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Play Or Code?</h2>
<p>Charles asks:
<a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/2007/11/is-werewolf-killing-conference-hackfest.html">Is Werewolf Killing the Conference Hackfest?</a>
</p>
<img src="IMGP7110.jpg" alt="Werewolf game at RubyConf" />
<div class="caption"><p>He’s accusing, not coding.</p></div>
<p>The issue is pretty fully explored in the comments to
Charles’ piece.  On balance, I’m probably with Chad Fowler.</p>
<p>I’ve only played a handful of games, but I did OK, on the winning
side in Charlotte two out of three games, and narrating one for the first
time, which is kind of fun.  And I did once manage to gleefully expose
Charles’ wolfish essence; he was tired and being just way too quiet.</p>

<title>Good Ruby</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I was at
<a href="http://rubyconf.org/agenda.html">RubyConf</a> ten days ago and just
now catching up, been overloaded.  This was my second RubyConf
and, like last time, I came away inspired.
This is an illustrated fan letter; but there are problems in the
community and at the conference; I’ve written about them 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/11/12/Bad-Ruby">separately</a>.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>This Is Serious</h2>
<p>There were quite a few people there, someone said 500.  
Almost all, unlike in previous years, are getting paid for Ruby work.
Currently there is no intent to turn this
into a big-league thing like
<a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2008/public/content/home">RailsConf</a>;
the intent rather is try to keep the costs down and the scale smaller.
Which is maybe tenable for another year; but the leakage from the now
immense Rails community into the much more intense and focused Rubyland is
inevitable, and one way or another there will be a mainstream Ruby conference
whether we want it or not.</p>
<img src="IMGP7122.jpg" alt="Attendees at RubyConf 2007" />
<div class="caption"><p>It’s big!</p></div>
<p>But for now, it’s sure easy to sink into the warm bath of the
family/enthusiast atmosphere for a couple of days and enjoy the warm glow.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Quality</h2>
<p>Here’s an un-secret; the quality of sessions is much higher at RubyConf
than RailsConf.  Which shouldn’t be surprising.  Ruby is a well-designed
general-purpose computer language which can be made to do anything; Rails is a
carefully-constrained framework for building applications with Web front ends
and database back ends, which derives a large part of its power from removing
options and simplifying the problem.  So Ruby the language just gives you more
to talk about.</p>
<img src="IMGP7126.jpg" alt="Conferees interacting and reacting at RubyConf 2007" />
<p>Every table had electrical power and there was a network; it was
regularly overloaded, but lots of people had GPRS or some other
alternative.  Everybody had a laptop, and it’s almost but not quite a Mac
monoculture.</p>
<img src="IMGP7123.jpg" alt="Macintosh computers at play at RubyConf 2007" />
<p>The IRC channel and Twitterflow were both lively.  I am convinced this
is the right way to run a meeting; it’s simply an unacceptable waste of human
potential for several hundred people to sit still just listening, neither
reacting nor interacting.
And on those occasions when a speaker gets hot and the arc of the
presentation soars out of the ordinary, the laptops languish and the faces
look up.  Which is <em>real</em> attention, a rare and precious commodity; but
it has to be earned, just climbing on a stage isn’t good enough.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Software Engineering</h2>
<p>There were lots of good talks—on identity, on optimization, deep dives on
coding style, you name it—but
for my money the white-hot spot was tools and techniques, as in Software
Engineering, as in building <em>and maintaining</em> better programs faster.
I was particularly
energized by a talk from Eric Hodel, seen below:</p>
<img src="IMGP7130.jpg" alt="Eric Hodel speaking at RubyConf 2007" />
<p>The tool suite these guys have been building and using is absolutely
remarkable.  I don’t know, maybe it’s the same story over in some other
communities where I don’t hang out, but this community’s thought leaders are
several major steps ahead of both mainstream Enterprise IT and mainstream
commercial software.</p>
<p>Tools like RSpec, Autotest, Heckle, Hoe, I just haven’t seen this stuff
outside the Ruby community.  I think Sun needs to hire some of these people
ASAP and get up to speed.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>1.9</h2>
<p>Well, it looks like our Japanese Rubyist colleagues have finally done the
rational software-engineering thing; slashed a bunch of features, become
date-driven, and are ready to pull the trigger on Ruby 1.9 by the end of
2007.  This was the real news in Matz’s keynote.</p>
<img src="IMGP7140.jpg" alt="Matsumoto Yukihiro (Matz) at his RubyConf 2007 keynote" />
<div class="caption"><p>Matz’s shadow looks like Buddha.</p></div>
<p>What exactly is in and what’s out is something of a moving target, but
at this point in history, 1.9 badly needs the virtue of actual existence, much
more than any that have to do with mere features.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Fun</h2>
<p>I’ve said it before but I’ll say it again: Ruby is the <em>nicest</em>
among all the open-source communities with which I’ve been involved.  
It’s a pleasure and a privilege to be involved.  I’ll be back.</p>

<title>WF XIV: My Opinion</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is the fourteenth progress report from the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/20/Wide-Finder">Wide Finder Project</a>.
I still have a bunch of Wide Finders to run, and for the time being I’ll keep
trying to run what people send me; we can’t have too much data
about this problem.  But some conclusions are starting to look unavoidable to
me.</p>
<p>First off, you should stop reading this and visit Eigenclass to read
Mauricio Fernandez’s
<a href="http://eigenclass.org/hiki/wide-finder-conclusions">Conclusions about
Wide Finder, C++, OCaml, JoCaml, Erlang and friends</a>.  
While I don’t buy
his use of the word “interpreted”, I find it hard to argue with his
conclusions about languages and implementations (but visit his comments).
My conclusions are (I think) fairly language-independent, and are about
technical strategies; what works and what doesn’t and cost-benefit
trade-offs.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Bypassing the Filesystem</h2>
<p>This is not a new finding.  When
I/O is on your critical path and you’re on a Unix-like system, you quite likely
need to be doing <code>mmap()</code> rather than <code>read()</code> if you
can.  In many circumstances, the path through the OS’ VM-paging subsystem is
quicker 
than through most filesystem implementations.  Multics, an influence on most
modern operating systems, had only memory-mapped I/O.</p>
<p>The downside to this is that files are a very natural lens to look through
at persistent data.  Every language has <code>gets()</code> or equivalent for a
good reason.</p>
<p>Also note that the advantages of memory-mapping are overwhelming when
you’re doing <em>input</em>, and your program semantics don’t require random
update.  It would be dangerous to extrapolate too much past that scenario.</p>
<p>I think it’s OK for programmers to want to tell the system “Run this code
on each line of this data.”  If it’s more efficient to do that in a
memory-mapped way, the infrastructure ought to just make it happen.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Parallel the I/O</h2>
<p>While Wide Finder is not strictly “I/O-bound”, it’s certainly got a big I/O
component.  If you want good performance on parallel hardware, you need your
I/O concurrent.</p>
<p>Combining memory-mapping and concurrency yielded
fairly mind-boggling results.  Check those
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/10/30/WF-Results#p-12">Bonnie numbers</a>;
one core on this particular box maxes out around 160M/second of block input,
so just straightforwardly block-reading the data would burn over 5.5 seconds;
yet the JoCaml version ran in less than two.</p>
<p>So while this is obviously worth doing, the same issue arises; programmers
<em>like</em> being able to say “Run this code on each line of this data” and
that’s reasonable.  So what we want is a really cheap way for them to add
"... and I don’t care what order you run ’em in, or if a bunch run at
once”.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Bypassing Regular Expressions</h2>
<p>The Wide Finder programmers did all sorts of pattern-matching voodoo to
dodge the overhead
of regular expression processing.  I don’t have a good quantitative handle on
how much of the global speedup this bought, but I’m not convinced that it’s a
good idea.</p>
<p>Regular Expressions are incredibly compact and expressive and in my opinion
a <em>good</em> tool that programmers should use to drive the logic of
processing text.  The articles in <cite>Beautiful Code</cite> (not just mine)
make it obvious that thoughtful developers obsess about regexes, and there’s a
reason for that.  They also make the case, which I’ve heard repeatedly, that
there is plenty of scope for optimization in currently-popular regex
engines.</p>
<p>I suspect we may have been pushed over the edge of this slippery slope by
Erlang’s lousy default regex engine.  And it’ll come down to a trade-off:  If
that fast JoCaml code could be simplified by going regex at a cost, say, of a
factor of two or three in performance, that might be a good trade-off.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Computation</h2>
<p>The Wide Finder does require you to accumulate results per unique article;
doing this concurrently in parallel is going to require some thought.  It’s
difficult in that there’s no real distinction between readers and
updaters; the data structures are write-only for most of the program’s
run.</p>
<p>While this actually didn’t seem like a big deal to the Wide Finder
implementors, the computation being done here is about as simple as it gets.
So I think this is the tough end of the problem: What kind of a
general-purpose computation framework do you give developers doing this kind
of work?  And to be fair, it’s not one that Wide Finder does much to
explore.</p>
<p>Up till a couple of weeks ago, I would probably have argued that the Erlang
model was the best I’d seen for cracking that nut.  Now I think that that join
calculus, as exemplified in JoCaml, deserves a serious look.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I still think that the ideal-world solution looks something like
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/29/WF-Goal">this</a>.  But I’ve sure
learned a lot about how we might get there from here.</p>

<title>Narita T2 ANA Lounge</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>If you travel a lot on Star Alliance and you’re heading out of
Narita, I’d like to recommend the ANA Lounge in Narita Terminal 2, out at
the far end around Gate 44.  It’s one of the nicest I’ve seen anywhere.
They have lots of space, comfy chairs, secluded cubicles if you need to buckle
down, decent WiFi albeit with slow DNS, excellent draught beer from a way-cool
automated pouring machine, a
selection of fine sakes, vegetarian sushi, and—this is just beyond
brilliant—an Udon/Soba bar where a couple of wrinkled old guys will fix you a
bowl on demand.  There are few items I can think of that are more proactively
therapeutic against a 10+-hour flight than a bellyfull of light warm salty
Japanese soup and noodles. If 
you’re feeling burned out and have four or five fine sakes that tends to
counteract the benefits though.  Hmmm, upstairs there’s an ANA “First Class”
facility I didn’t have sufficient status to get into.  The mind boggles at the
delights that must lie inside.</p>

<p>I snagged the front center seat on the Narita bus so I had a panoramic view
forward; the haze of jetlag
and post-speech letdown was biting hard as the Nissan Diesel grumbled up onto
the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Bridge_%28Tokyo%29">Rainbow Bridge</a>.
The architectural madness around Tokyo Bay
soars white on cream on beige on black in the filtered sun against the
shit-coloured Tokyo November afternoon sky and when you’re weakened you can
kid yourself that it all fits together and makes sense somehow, but it
doesn’t.  It can’t be photographed and it can’t be described, you have to see
it and you still won’t believe it. It’s just crazy, that’s all.</p>

<title>Shinjuku Cameras</title>
<finished/>
</head>
<body>
<p>I didn’t have to take off for my first meeting till eleven, so I cruised
into Shinjuku around 9:30 to see what I could do about the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/11/09/Thinking-About-Cameras">slow-camera
problem</a>.  Which turned out to be
about perfect, since it’s Yodabashi’s opening time; so I got a leisurely look
at the stuff with help from the staff.  I gather the normal Yodabashi
experience is wall-to-wall crush.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>GR-D2</h2>
<p>The place was just plastered with ads for the much-ballyhooed
<a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2007/10/new-gr-digital-.html">Ricoh
GR-D2</a>
but it’s not launching till next week.  I have to say, the advertising was
polished and compelling.  It’s kind of irritating Ricoh doesn’t make a bit
more of an effort to export.</p>
<p>I was hanging with
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/akihito/">Akihito Fujii</a>, who has the
original GR-Digital, and he’d just bought
the GW-1 “Wide Conversion Lens” which takes it from 28 to 21mm and gives the
already-stylish camera some serious steampunk mojo, to my eye.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Sigma</h2>
<p>Anyhow, based on the wisdom of my contributors, I thought I’d have a look
at that
<a href="http://sigmaphoto.com/lenses/lenses_all_details.asp?id=3300&amp;navigator=6">Sigma 30mm F1.4</a>.
The guidebooks say that Yodabashi doesn’t really cater to foreigners, but I
have no gripes.  I’d written “Sigma 30mm F1.4” on a piece of paper and
showed it to the nearest guy.  He rummaged around and came up empty, but
showed me a couple of comparables.  When I didn’t bite, he beckoned “follow
me” and walked straight out the front door, down the street, around the
corner, and upstairs to Yodabashi’s <em>main</em> camera department, where they
had oodles of stuff.  He and another dude searched on the computer and
ransacked the back 
room and came up with what I assume is the previous rev of the Sigma, it has
the same designation except without the “HSM” hyper-sonic auto-focus.  The
price was reasonable and I got the sales tax knocked off, so I bought it.
And I have to say that I found Yodabashi perfectly <i>gaijin</i>-friendly.</p>
<p>Here’s the Sigma; compare the picture with the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/04/27/Pentax-P-DA-40mm">pancake in the same pose</a>.</p>
<img src="IMG_0567.jpg" alt="Pentax DSLR with Sigma 30mm F1.4 lens" />
<p>In general, Yodabashi’s prices were very close to what I see on the street
here in Vancouver.  Which means that the US is going to be a better bargain
than either.</p>
<p>I shot some pictures and yep, this puppy can pull in those photons; here
are Tim O’Reilly and Joi Ito opening up Web2.0 Expo Tokyo.</p>
<img src="IMGP7203.jpg" alt="Tim O’Reilly and Joi Ito open Web2.0 Expo Tokyo" />
<p>There’s no free lunch; you get all that light-gathering ability and you pay
a couple of obvious prices.  First, there’s unsubtle barrel distortion, as in
this building somewhere near Shinagawa.</p>
<img src="IMGP7178.jpg" alt="Industrial building somewhere near Shinagawa" />
<p>But that’s OK, you normally wouldn’t be using this for architectural shots
anyhow.  Hmm, Lightroom ought to have a tool to fix this.</p>
<p>And then when you shoot at <i>f</i>1.4, you have enough depth of field for
maybe one grain of rice.
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/shita/">Takashi</a> took me out to a
restaurant that specialized in tofu.  In my mind I can hear my readers’ eyes
rolling, and I’m not normally huge on tofu myself, but this place was great.
There were about eight courses, all different, all tasty, and a judicious
mix of a bit of sashimi and salad and so on.  I forget the Japanese name, but
Takashi tells me it means “Plum Flower”.
The presentation was beautiful and I thought I’d try to capture it.</p>
<p>Here is the menu and one of the many courses.  The way the lens deals with
the low light is outstanding, but <em>bokeh</em> ain’t the word for the focus
issues.</p>
<img src="IMGP7183.jpg" alt="Menu at Tokyo tofu restaurant" />
<img src="IMGP7189.jpg" alt="One of many courses at Tokyo tofu restaurant" />
<p>So, all in all, a successful first step.  Of course, what I really want is
the 
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/11/09/Thinking-About-Cameras#c1194808018.35944">Angenieux
crêpe</a> that Alex Waterhouse-Hayward pointed out, but this will do for
now.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Big Cameras</h2>
<p>The Nikon D3 isn’t out yet, but Canon’s maniacal assault on the limits of
the possible, the
<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/previews/canoneos1dsmarkiii/">1D</a>, was on
display.  Yeah, what these big boys do is great, and I’d guess a necessity for
a pro, but they’re just way, way, way too big for me.</p>
<p>So I’ll probably swap the aging Pentax for one of the current “K” models,
or whatever supersedes them, 
sometime this winter, and I think that for inside shooting, the Sigma plus the
anti-shake will get me where I want to be.</p>
<p>But for most times, and for travel, it’ll go on being some wide-angle but
mostly the one-hand-grip pancake.</p>

<title>WF XV: On Parallel I/O</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is the fifteenth progress report from the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/20/Wide-Finder">Wide Finder Project</a>;
it’s fairly-uncooked musing about parallelism and I/O.</p>
<p>Preston L. Bannister, in 
<a href="http://bannister.us/weblog/2007/11/12/the-wide-finder-project/">The Wide Finder Project</a>
(sample quote: “First, the example problem
chosen by Tim Bray is crap...”) asserts, essentially, that there is no such
thing as parallel I/O.</p>
<p>Normally, I’d tend to agree.  They say “memory is the new disk, disk is the
new tape” and one of the reasons that’s true is that disk seeking is still
pretty slow but modern disks can read remarkably fast sequentially.
But still; as I reported before, Bonnie seems to think that that system can pull
data through the <code>read()</code> call at about 160MB/sec, and the fact that
Fernandez’ JoCaml code processed it at more or less four times that speed
leads one to think that <em>something</em> is happening in parallel.</p>
<p>Maybe I was getting fooled by the fact that I ran Bonnie on a 20G file-set
while the Wide Finder data was just under 1G.  So I re-ran Bonnie with a test
file very close to the WF data size, and in a bunch of successive runs
observed maximum block input performance, in MB/sec in successive runs, of 230, 214,
215, 261, and 230.  If you look at how Bonnie works, the block-input phase
immediately follows a phase in which the same file is read through
<code>stdio</code>, so the cache ought to be pretty hot.
So let’s say around 250, thus you’d expect to need four seconds to read a 1G file.
And the JoCaml code still beat that by a factor of two.</p>
<p>Empirically, the I/O is somewhat parallel (unless the <code>mmap()</code>
code path is twice as fast as <code>read()</code>, which seems implausible).
How could this be happening?</p>
<p>There are a bunch of plausible explanations, but no experimental evidence
yet to help us choose among them.  Let’s have some fun speculating.</p>
<p>This is UFS not ZFS on a fairly-full disk, so to start with, the blocks are
quite likely smashed all over the disk and you’re never gonna get truly
sequential I/O anyhow.  So if there’s a lot of seeking going on anyhow, it’s
perfectly possible that the filesystem or the disk scheduler is optimizing the
read requests and spraying the blocks from different parts of the file out to
different cores with minimal head movement.</p>
<p>Also, bear in mind that on a modern server, there are a lot of layers of
indirection hiding behind that <code>read()</code> call.  There
may be multiple physical paths to the disk, and the operating system or the
filesystem or something may well be dealing different phases of the I/O out
among cores as a matter of course.  Or maybe the filesystem cache is smart
about multiple parallel threads accessing big data; that’d probably be real
helpful to MySQL and Oracle and friends, so it wouldn’t be too surprising.
Or some other voodoo that I don’t know
about.</p>
<p>So yeah, empirically, parallelizing I/O seems to work even if we don’t know
why.</p>
<p>Something else occurs to me.  In this kind of app, when you’ve got cores to
burn and a serious I/O issue, would it <em>ever</em> not be a good idea to
compress the data?  ZFS has that built-in.</p>
<p>I’m thinking I need to write a parallelized I/O phase into Bonnie.</p>

<title>Public Execution?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>See, here they are, heads bowed to receive the blow.</p>
<img src="IMGP7164.jpg" alt="Mobile earthquake-preparedness demo in Tokyo" />
<p>Well, not really.  In fact it’s a mobile earthquake-preparedness thing.
Volunteers from the audience get in the truck and it simulates an earthquake.
The lights on the back of the little room light up as the shaking builds:
three, then four, then building up and peaking somewhere over seven.
You see, theory says you’re supposed to get under a table or something, as
that pair were doing.  Here’s another:</p>
<img src="IMGP7165.jpg" alt="Mobile earthquake-preparedness demo in Tokyo" />
<p>In fact, a few heroes from the audience refused to hunker and tried to ride
it out.  Most of them gave up when the needle was pushing seven, but this one
guy, tall and skinny in a bad blue suit, just wasn’t gonna cave in, and while
he looked pretty dorky thrashing back and forth, he did manage to stay on his
feet.  Me, when the Big One hits I’m diving under the nearest desk.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Ochanomizu</h2>
<p>That’s both the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ochanomizu_Station">JR Station</a> this
is just outside and the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ochanomizu">pretty cool neighborhood</a>
it’s in.  Last year’s RubyKaigi was around here.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I overestimated the transit time and got to the station quite a bit early, so I had time to watch the earthquake truck, then score a
sweet strong Japanese iced coffee from a vending machine (there’s nothing like
it), sit down behind the Ochanomizu mini-mall or whatever it’s called by a
waterfall, open the laptop, drink deep of someone’s open WiFi, and do some
email while I was waiting.</p>
<p>And I think to myself: <i>What a wonderful world.</i></p>

<title>Android</title>

<body>
<p>I’m having a little trouble understanding Android; the business side I mean, not the technology.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Technology</h2>
<p>It looks like decent
enough software, although there is some pretty sharp criticism in
<a href="http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2007/11/five-problems-with-google-android.html">Five problems with Google Android</a>.
In particular, as a scarred
veteran of X Windows programming and one who’s welcoming the
introduction of resolution-independence in OS X, I too think it would be
wonderful to get past pixel-based imaging models. <i>[Update: the “Five
Problems” guy
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/11/20/Android#c1195683344.824671">may
be wrong</a> on this one.]</i></p>
<p>Still, if anything can match the iPhone, it’ll be a truly commons-based,
radically-open platform.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Licensing and Business</h2>
<p>I think that the problem in the mobile space has always been
the business model, not the technology.
I’ve
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/23/Flat-Rate-Considered-Harmful">argued</a>
repeatedly that it will never get interesting
until the mobile network operators relax their death-grip on
the customer relationship, open the networks and devices, and focus on their
core competences: bandwidth and billing.  The technology hasn’t been that
great, but it hasn’t been <em>that</em> bad.  My perfectly decent little Samsung
phone, with a truly great screen, has Java and lots of other goodness, but I
can’t actually run any 
programs unless I buy them from the network operator.  Oddly, there are no
programs for sale that are interesting in the slightest.
That’s the problem.</p>
<p>Unless I’m missing something, the big deal with 
the Java-language-on-another-VM setup seems to be about using the
Apache license, as opposed to the Sun version’s GPL.
Which means (and once again, I may be missing something) that any old
cellphone maker can take the Android software and build another locked-down
control-freak phone just like my Samsung.</p>
<p>So what’s the point?</p>
<p>As a Sun shareholder, sure, I’d like our technology on those mobile
devices. But as a Sun shareholder, I see another huge upside in the
mass of server infrastructure everyone will need when the network operators
unclench and we get an explosion of creativity and Mobile/Internet apps.
So if Android will do that, it’d be hard to be against it.  Will Android do
that?  Why?</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Disclosure</h2>
<p>Like it says on the front page of <span class='o'>ongoing</span>, I do
<em>not</em> speak for Sun except when I say I am.  In this particular
matter, not only do I not speak for Sun, I have no idea what our official
position on Android is, I’m not in that loop, nor have I read the legal
Android fine print, nor have I downloaded the software.</p>

<p>The big issues?  War, hunger, and oppression, of course.  After that,
questions of human communication seem pretty important to me.  Especially
since the landscape we stand on is shifting.

<p><i>Homo sapiens</i> has been around for 200,000 years, more or less.
Evidence suggests that human language has to be at least 50,000 years old,
and there are reasonable arguments (<i>cf.</i> Chomsky) that it goes back
about as far as we do.</p>
<p>For most of those years, the only way for people to use language was to be
in each others’ presence.  But as time has unfolded we’ve been fixing that
problem.  Not, however at an even
pace:</p>

<h2 id='p-1'>Sorting Them Out</h2>
<p>As of today, if I want to deliver a message to other humans, I have a
<em>whole lot of ways</em> to go about it.  Most of them have the same cost:
zero, more or less.  The exception is face-to-face, which can
be very 
expensive; consider the horrifying number of Sun’s travel dollars that
I burn every year.</p>
<p>I observe this, and questions occur to me.  Have we invented all the
communication modes we’re going to need, or will there be more?
What needs are going 
un-addressed?  And at the meta level: Does all this have a general
higher-order structure that might help us think about these things?</p>
<p>We observe empirically that humans have little trouble deciding whether any
particular message is best suited to a phone call, an email, or a Twitter
post.  What might be going into those decisions?</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Immediacy</h2>
<p>You might also say “latency”; how long does it take from a message to
filter via language from your mind to mine?  Face-to-face speech has excellent
immediacy, as does a telephone conversation.  The immediacy of texting is
somewhat less, and a blog post doesn’t arrive until the reader gets around to
looking.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Lifespan</h2>
<p>How long does a message last?  Modulo the fact that in 2007 everything is
being recorded, by default a spoken word lasts only while the air’s still
vibrating, and then becomes subject to the vagaries of human wetware.  At the
other end of the spectrum, a blog post potentially persists as long as the
Internet’s memory, which is an unknown quantity but almost certainly longer
than the human lifespan.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Audience</h2>
<p>How large an audience can a message reach?  Face-to-face is limited by the
number of people you can pack into a room; realistically, more than a couple
of hundred and it becomes more like broadcasting.  A telephone conversation
usually includes only two people, while blogs and broadcasting can potentially
reach, well, everybody.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Sorting Them Out</h2>
<p>So, I decided to try and illustrate how these things sort out.  I assigned
arbitrary Immediacy, Lifespan, and Audience scores in the range 0-40 to a
bunch of communication modes.</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td class="empty"></td>

<p>Then I tried graphing it.</p>
<p>I’m going to keep fooling with this.  You see,
if you draw the right graph, maybe you’ll see the gaping hole in it, the Next
Big Thing.</p>

promise a return to the living after this): The <cite>Nocturnes</cite> by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chopin">Frédéric Chopin</a> (1810-1849),
as recorded in 1977 and 1978 by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudio_Arrau">Claudio Arrau</a>
(1903-1991).  Each of the last three (this, Mozart/Brain, and Bach/Kremer)
are fine music which has been recorded by many fine performers, but where I
never bothered checking any other performances out after hearing the record in
question.  The <cite>Nocturnes</cite> have no raw edges, no starkness, but are
ravishingly romantic and irresistibly pretty, while still being involving and
deep.  They’re nocturnal all right; two solid hours of sweet dark-brown ebb
and flow, bedtime music for sure.
<i>(“5★♫” series introduction <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music">here</a>;
with <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music#p-1">an
explanation</a> of why the title may look broken.)</i></p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Context</h2>
<p>I have really nothing new to add about either Chopin or
Arrau.  I understand there are people who don’t like Chopin, finding it too
busy or too melodramatic or whatever; hard for me to understand.  It may not
be true that Chopin never used one note where twenty-seven could be fit in,
but nobody would call him economical with ink on music paper.</p>
<p>I find it doesn’t bother me; I like minimalism as much as the next man, but
I’ve always found that Frédéric got it about right.  I will say this, though:
while I love watching a hotshot virtuoso like
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/04/17/Yundi">Yundi Li</a> rip up the Chopin
live, it’s this slow stuff that I listen to again and again.  Probably because
in a Nocturne, there just has to be space between all those notes.</p>
<img src="Chopin.jpg" alt="Frédéric Chopin" />
<div class="caption"><p>Chopin</p></div>
<p>I visited Chopin’s grave once, in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A8re_Lachaise">Père Lachaise
Cemetery</a>.  It still had flowers, lots of them and fresh ones.  This was in
1991; Yves Montand had just died and I think his was the only grave
with more flowers than Frédéric’s.</p>
<img src="Claudio-Arrau.jpg" alt="Claudio Arrau" />
<div class="caption"><p>Arrau</p></div>
<p>Arrau was uncontroversial, a child prodigy at age five and busily
recording more or less into his grave.  I have his 
Beethoven <cite>Apassionata</cite>, which I’m very fond of, and in poking
around to prepare this piece, discovered you can
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNYYwjWBR7E">watch that on
YouTube</a>; worth checking out I’d say.</p>
<img src="Arrau-Chopin.jpg" class="inline" alt="Arrau plays Chopin’s Nocturnes" />

<h2 id='p-2'>The Music</h2>
<p>There are twenty-one Nocturnes, scattered fairly evenly through the years
of Chopin’s
composing career.  They get progressively free-er and darker and, it must be
said, weirder.  One wonders what strange territory Chopin would have explored
if he’d lived another decade or four.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to like about them.  The opening notes of the opening piece,
written in Chopin’s twenties, reach out like a hand, inviting you in.  There are
flows of melodic gold, sparkles of diamond arpeggiation, snarls of low-note
molasses, and always a feeling of endless legato flow, music pouring through
the night, as much as you could ever want to listen to.</p>

<p>I have to be careful how late I start listening to this, because I almost
always end up listening to both CDs, end to end.  How could you walk away from
this much beauty?  I find a small scotch adds to the enjoyment, but don’t have
two or you’ll get all weepy that the music has to end.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Sampling It</h2>
<p>The disk is still on sale, new, at Amazon.  I bet there are tons of
used ones if you poke around, and I must observe that neither Frédéric nor
Claudio will miss the royalties.  But do get the shiny disk, the sound is at
once huge and intimate, and I don’t think MP3’s really go there.</p>

<title>Ruby Survey Results</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Highlights: 1,000 responders, of which 470 Rails and 530 Ruby; TextMate is
the most popular tool globally, but the Vi family is slightly preferred on the
Ruby side.
Thanks, everyone, for pitching in!</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Methodology</h2>
<p>The questions were:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Is your work mostly Rails, or do you do significant
non-Rails Ruby development?</p></li>
<li><p>Which developer tools do you use? Pick as many as you want.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>On the latter, the options were (presented in random order to each
participant):</p> 
<ul>
<li><p>TextMate</p></li>
<li><p>Emacs family</p></li>
<li><p>Vi family</p></li>
<li><p>Eclipse</p></li>
<li><p>NetBeans</p></li>
<li><p>IntelliJ</p></li>
<li><p>Other (please say which)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I announced the survey on this blog, on the <code>ruby-lang</code> mailing
list and IRC channel, and asked someone to do the same in the Rails
equivalents.  I cut off the survey when the sample size reached 1,000, after
six days.</p>
<p>I downloaded a <code>.xls</code> of the results from SurveyMonkey, and did
a little hand-sanitation.  Lots of people had listed tools (<code>irb</code>,
<code>rake</code>, <code>autotest</code>, you name it) that weren’t actually
editors.  Also, there were a few editors that showed up often enough under
“Other” that probably they should have been among the choices.</p>
<p>So I did three flavors of cleanup: First, where they’d listed Aptana and/or
RadRails, but hadn’t listed Eclipse, changed that to an Eclipse vote.
Second, I regularized the names of Komodo, jEdit, sciTE, and so on.  Third, I
removed all the non-editor tools.</p>
<p>Then a ran a little
Ruby script to group the totals by into the “mostly-Rails” and “significant
non-Rails Ruby” buckets, using the labels “Rails” and “Ruby”.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Results</h2>
<p><i>[Corrected: Editing error had undercounted sciTE.]</i></p>
<p>First of all, the sampling methodology is laughably unscientific; the
audience is self-selecting.
I asked
SurveyMonkey to accept only one result from any given IP address, but we know
how much that’s worth.
I find the results interesting, but they’d be bounced out of any refereed
journal.</p>
<p>You can look at SurveyMonkey’s 
<a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/sr.aspx?sm=Nv0IH43ESziEF9JaiqTMD2XRWVXmaYYIyQAcvlPvtz8_3d">decent presentation of the results</a>;
it doesn’t group by Ruby/Rails, but it does allow you to look at the raw
“Other” comments.</p>
<p>Lots of people selected multiple tools; in aggregate, the 1,000 responses
named 1,575.</p>
<p>Here are three quick graphs summarizing the results, with bars for any
software that got at least 10 votes, which is 0.1%.</p>

<p>It seems to be having a growth spurt.  Every time I check my mail, there
are a dozen “XXX is following you” messages.  My algorithm is, I
bring up their Twitter page and give it one glance and make a follow/no-follow
decision in about 0.5 seconds.  Which probably means there are interesting
people I’m not following because they weren’t interesting in that half-second.
And I have more followers than followees, which probably makes me an
egotistical bastard.  Oh well.  I think Twitter is here to stay.</p>

<title>Wii Are Not Amused</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>What happened was, in single-Dad mode a couple of weekends ago, Best Buy
had a special on the 500G LaCie so I took the kids down there.  I was walking
by the gaming area and saw something I never have before: a couple of Wiis on
the shelf.  The one I grabbed turned out to be an open-box, had been
returned by someone, so it was cheap too.  So far, I’m waiting to be blown
away.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Sports</h2>
<p>The sports package is good family fun.  As I write, my eight-year-old and
two friends are hurtling around in front of the TV with the toddlergirl
cackling in glee at them.
The Miis are kind of dorky-looking but that’s no big deal.</p>
<p>We’ve already had our first Wii injury; I got in the way of the boy’s
Bowling follow-through and took a nasty bruise on one hand.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Zelda, Yawn</h2>
<p>We picked up the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Twilight_Princess">Twilight Princess</a>
episode of Zelda, which was reasonably well-reviewed.  I got an hour or two in
and I’ve pretty well bogged down.  Maybe it’s just me, but the pace seems
leaden.  I’m wandering around the first big dungeon, the puzzles are hard
enough that it takes quite a while, and it’s just not that stimulating.</p>
<p>The combat part is sort of fun, but I don’t think I have the
stick-to-itiveness to slog through the rest of the dungeon.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Christmas</h2>
<p>It looks like we have a few of the family coming down for Christmas.
Anyone want to recommend something multi-player that’s seriously amusing?</p>

and I dropped it off at

I switched back to the N-1 PowerBook, and have been too busy running
around and preparing for one thing or another to think about setting up a new
computer, so I didn’t pester them.  So today I called in and they said “Apple
doesn’t have any 120G disks in stock, and there’s no ETA for the part, and we
can’t call and ask them to expedite until ten business days have passed.”
I said “So how about a different disk then?” and they said “Well, procedures
are we have to do it this way, but if you wanted to purchase a third-party
disk...” Is it just me, or is this fairly outrageous?

<p>That would be <i>Our Father, who art in heaven</i>.  
Which is to say, when you a URI that has <code>#whatever</code> on the end,
what <code>#whatever</code> means depends on what kind of thing it is.  Up
till now, if it was just a chunk of text (<code>text/plain</code> in web-geek
lingo), it didn’t mean anything.
<a href="http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/ietf-announce/current/msg04332.html">Now
it does.</a>  I have a special interest in this one.</p>
<p>The special interest isn’t that I actually particularly need to do this; in
fact, my first reaction to the draft was “Whatever for!?!?” but they had some
decent motivating use-cases.</p>
<p>Once I got past that I had a big problem with the draft I read.  It had an
OK model of character/line addressing, as it still does.  But it also had
addressing by regex match, and furthermore, you could combine all the different
selectors so as to point at a more or less arbitrary collection of
discontinuous chunks of text.</p>
<p>I wrote back “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Ain't_Gonna_Need_It">YAGNI</a>.
Decent idea, but why not just slice it back to characters and lines and see if
that’ll do it?”
Some people who know me will be snickering at this point, because I am
notorious for advising everybody to slash their draft specs brutally.  
It usually doesn’t work.
Well, for the first time ever in my entire career, after a couple of
back-and-forths with Erik and Martin, they said, basically, “OK”.
I owe them a beer next time I see them.</p>

<p>I was really wrong about the OOXML/ISO story; told everyone “It’ll sail
through ISO, don’t bother with the process.”  Boy, was I wrong.  At the moment
that process is hurtling toward the mildly-historic “Ballot Resolution Meeting”
in Geneva in February (read about it 
<a href="http://www.adjb.net/index.php?entry=entry071125-211810">here</a> and
<a href="http://www.jtc1sc34.org/repository/0932.htm">here</a>).
Anyhow, all those tens of thousands of comments on the first draft, which were
previously invisible behind some ISO veil, are now out there for all to view,
tag, hyperlink, annotate, and enhance, at the
unofficial but excellent <a href="http://www.dis29500.org/">DIS29500
Comments</a> site (tagline: “Help the OOXML BRM concentrate on issues of
substance”). The person behind it seems to be Alan Bell, whom I don’t think I
know, but the world owes him a vote of thanks.
Obviously, this whole thing does retain a grimy side; see the excellent Martin
Bryan’s fairly-despondent

<title>Rebuilding the World</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith the unexpurgated diary of my simultaneously rebuilding my Mac
environment from scratch, and moving to Leopard.  This is partly just for my
own benefit, so I don’t forget the important steps, but may be of mild
interest to others who carry a heavy OSS load on their Macs, and may prove
a mildly useful in someone’s search results down the line.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Back Story</h2>
<p>What happened was, I was installing Leopard on
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/03/22/MacBook">Black Beauty</a>, my 13"
MacBook, when the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/11/21/Leopard-Ouch">world ended</a>.
Apple
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/12/03/Hate-Apple-Day">dropped the ball</a>.
(WTF did I spend Sun’s money on AppleCare for?)  So I went over to
<a href="http://www.ncix.com/">NCIX</a> and picked up a 160G 7200RPM
Seagate.  Nice place, NCIX; I’d go back.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Hardware</h2>
<p>It turns out that replacing a MacBook disk drive is a doddle; it took me
like ten minutes end-to-end, and I’m no hardware wizard.  So if anyone is
finding their disk filling up, go ahead and upgrade yourself, it’s a snap.  
It’s a really elegant piece of design in there.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>What to Restore</h2>
<p>In the interim, I’d stitched my life back together on my old 15" PowerBook,
which felt heavy and klunky and slow and was totally useless with Adobe
Lightroom.  Once I’d got the MacBook pieced back together, and OS X installed,
I could have FireWire’d ’em together and replicated one onto the other with
Migration Assistant.  But I decided not to; I’d replicated each of my Macs
onto the next, dating back to 2003, and whereas my home directory is
reasonably clean, the system was cluttered up with all sorts of stuff I’d
installed and wasn’t using, or semi-uninstalled.
Also, my open-source ecosystem was a witches’ brew of Fink and DarwinPorts and
hand-built stuff in <code>/usr/local</code>.
Half the time I had no idea what instance of Perl or Ruby or ImageMagick or
whatever was actually being used.  And furthermore, I knew that a lot of that
code was probably PowerPC binaries running through Rosetta.</p>
<p>So, I decided to bring over just my home directory from the PowerBook and
rebuild my OSS environment from scratch.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Installer Can’t See New Disk</h2>
<p>The only glitch with installing Leopard was that after booting from the CD,
the installer couldn’t see my new disk.  Fortunately, the installer has a “Disk
Utility”, and it could see that Seagate 148G (Huh!?  I paid for 160!) disk.
Unfortunately, it didn’t have a “Format” button.  Fortunately, it did have an
“Erase” button, which gets you a standard Format-this-disk menu.  I guess some
Human-Factors genius at Apple decided that the pain avoided by people not
realizing that formatting a disk erases it as a side-effect was greater than
the pain experienced by people who can’t find the “Format” button.</p>
<p>Anyhow, formatting the disk took just a few seconds.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Copying Over with Migration Assistant</h2>
<p>I was assuming I’d just plug the old PowerBook into the MacBook and boot in
FireWire-disk mode (hold down the “T” key at power-on), and use
<code>tar</code> or something to get my data.</p>
<p>But it turns out that Migration Assistant is actually pretty flexible, it
was happy to copy over my data and a few system settings, like networks and
sharing, without taking any of the other System stuff.</p>
<p>There was one fly in the ointment.  I got everything plugged in, logged in,
fired up Migration Assistant, it looked at the new disk and said “Sure, I can
copy over Tim Bray, but there’s already an account of that name here.”  It
gave me a few options: choose a new name, restore somewhere else, and what I
really wanted, just overwrite the existing Tim Bray.  But that was greyed out,
without any indication of why.  I decided that it might be a problem that I
was currently logged in as myself, so I created another account named “Backup”
with admin privileges, logged into that, and then everything went fine.  It
took two or three hours to bring over my fifty-odd gig of data.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Compilers and Build Tools</h2>
<p>If you want to do anything with software, you’ll need compilers and linkers
and libraries 
and so on.  To get them, after you’ve installed Leopard
you have to look in the “Extra Software” folder on the install DVD and install
something called “Xcode Tools”.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>Leopard Has More Stuff</h2>
<p>On previous releases of OS X, the built-in versions of Perl and Ruby and so
on were pathetically out-of-date, so I’d been building them from source.
Leopard comes with Ruby 1.8.6 and Perl 5.8.8; on impulse
I typed “cpan” at the shell and, wonder of wonders, there was a nice
<code>cpan> </code> prompt looking at me.  Hey, it has gem too.</p>
<h2 id='p-8'>Fink or MacPorts?</h2>
<p>One should be enough.  I poked around and there’s not a slam-dunk winner,
but more people seemed to be leaning to MacPorts, so I went that way.
So I went there and installed ImageMagick, aspell,
and aspell-dict-en, no fuss, no muss, but no hurry either.
The amount of code that MacPorts has to assemble to build ImageMagick in
particular is mind-boggling.</p>
<p>The mantras you need to learn to install any particular “fooball”
are as follows.  First, find out what packages there are:</p>
<p><code>port list | grep -i fooball</code></p>
<p>Next, install:</p>
<p><code>sudo port install fooball-v5</code></p>
<p>You’re done, but you do have to munge your path to know about
<code>/opt/local/bin</code>.</p>
<h2 id='p-9'>MySQL</h2>
<p>I noticed that the
<a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html#downloads">MySQL
Downloads Page</a> has a nice <code>.dmg</code> with two packages; one for
MySQL itself and another to set up auto-start on boot.  Cool.</p>
<p>That doesn’t give you libraries though, so if you try to install
<code>DBD::mysql</code>, it’ll whine.  For that to work, I had to go get a
.tar.gz from
<a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/Current/">opensource.apple.com</a>
and do the <code>./configure</code>/<code>make</code> dance.</p>
<h2 id='p-10'>Distant Laughter</h2>
<p>Do you hear it?  That’d be
<a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2007/11/11/installing-mysql-on-ubuntu">Mark Pilgrim laughing</a>
at me for being such a fuckwit as to not be on Ubuntu, on which basically none
of this work is necessary.</p>
<h2 id='p-12'>OSS Extras</h2>
<p>I went and got
<a href="http://www.neooffice.org/">NeoOffice</a> and
<a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a> from their respective homes,
and that, I think, is all the OSS I need.</p>
<h2 id='p-13'>Hey, Adobe</h2>
<p>I needed to get Lightroom again.  I poked around in my mail archives and
found the original mail from Adobe from when I bought it back in March; the
download link still worked, and my serial number was right there, so I had
Lightroom up and running in no time.  Imagine, commercial software that’s
almost as convenient as Open Source!  What a concept.</p>
<h2 id='p-11'>Happy Ending</h2>
<p>With the new disk, I have 74G free... wow!
And the reconstituted MacBook is really a lot faster than both the 
PowerBook and than it used to be, pre-rebuild.  There’s no way to tell what
combination of Leopard and the faster disk and the cleaned-up OSS ecosystem
produced this result, but I’m enjoying it.</p>

<title>Leopard Notes</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith notes on the Leopard experience.  It’s been reviewed to death but
here are a couple of things I haven’t seen noted elsewhere; perhaps helpful
to people wondering whether to jump.
<i>[Update:  A couple of pleasant surprises, plus I’m assembling the bugs I
observe here.]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-8'>Ssh-agent Just Works</h2>
<p>Wow, I originally had my ssh setup more or less unchanged since 2003, but
no longer.  As of now, just type <code>ssh whoever@wherever</code>, and the
first time, if you’ve got the keys in place, it pops up and asks you for your
passphrase and whether or not you’d like that in the Keychain.  After that,
no more passwords.</p>
<h2 id='p-9'>Bug List</h2>
<p>Most of these have been reported; mostly here as Google fodder so other
people will perhaps not feel so alone.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If you have it set to ask for password on wake-from-sleep, sometimes
the password dialog comes up without focus, or mysteriously loses focus
halfway through your password.</p></li>
<li><p>Several people have observed that with my early-vintage Airport Extreme
WiFi station, when the computer wakes from sleep it often doesn’t find the
network. 
Turning your Airport quickly off and on usually fixes that.</p></li>
<li><p>Spaces and NetBeans interact toxically.  This could be a bug in Spaces
or Java or Swing or NetBeans.</p></li>
<li><p>My Griffin Powermate stopped working.  I can still control
individual apps, but the global volume control is hosed.</p></li>
</ol>
<img src="leopard-dock.png" alt="The Leopard Dock" class="inline" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Look &amp; Feel</h2>
<p>Lots of people have gripes and they seem well-founded, but it works pretty
well for me.
I’ve always been a
dock-on-the-side guy, and don’t keep folders there, and always have a dark
screen background.  So 
for me the new see-through Dock comes out looking pretty nice.  The dark
background also works well with the translucent menu-bar.</p>
<p>In general, I like the cool grey window dressing and the folder glyphs and
the new bits and pieces of trim all over the place.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Time Machine</h2>
<p>Yeah, seems like it should be great, assuming it works, but are those
space-opera graphics ever dorky.</p>
<p><i>[Update:]</i> Here’s how I’m using it; this is just a report, not a
suggestion, because it’s early days yet.  I work here and there around the
house, and on the road, but when I’m not traveling I have a regular ordinary
desk I sit behind.  That disk now has the current 500G LaCie drive sitting
permanently on it behind where the laptop goes, so I can’t see it.  I’ve added
the drive to the USB hub so it gets plugged in by default in the morning.  I’m
a little worried that these outboard drives aren’t built to run all day every
day, so I turn it on in the morning, and then off a couple of hours later when
Time Machine has had a chance to do its thing.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Spaces</h2>
<p>I’ve only been using this for a day, but so far it works great.  I have
all my communication apps on the main space.  Then I have Lightroom in the
next one over, full-screen, no menus or anything, and NetBeans in the next.
Both Lightroom and NetBeans make excellent use of the real estate, and both are
the kind of thing where it’s a big advantage to have all the communication
stuff hidden away where it can’t disrupt the flow.</p>
<p>There’s a bug, though: I can’t select NetBeans.app in the Spaces preference
pane to tie it to a particular space.  Flipping over there and starting it
seems to have about the same effect, so no biggie.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Expander</h2>
<p>Used to be, when I clicked on a <code>.zip</code> or <code>.tgz</code> or
whatever, this klunky “Unstuffer” application would wake up, unpack, then
ask me if I wanted to update it.  Now there’s this little dinky yellow thing
pops up just for a moment, enough faster that I’ve never actually got around
to looking at it closely.</p>
<p>A few years back, if you’d told me that I’d be using a GUI to unpack
tarballs, I would have laughed at you.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>FileVault</h2>
<p>I dunno. It’s always seemed like a high-risk thing, and it wastes disk
space, and it slows certain things down.  I should probably turn it back
on.</p>
<p>But it occurs to me, that pretty well all the really confidential stuff is
in <code>~/Library/Mail</code>; I’m wondering if there’s a good way to use
<code>hdiutil</code> or some such to encrypt just that.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Safer</h2>
<p>I now get a confirm dialogue when I hit “Empty Trash”.  This will make me
pause for a moment and think, and I just <em>know</em> it’ll save me 
grief somewhere down the road.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>Spotlight</h2>
<p>It’s fixed!  For years, I haven’t been able to search the full text of my
mail messages.  Now I can.  This is good.</p>

<title>5★♫: Mixed Up</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’m not a fan of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cure">The Cure</a>, particularly.
I am not nor have I ever been a Goth, and I laugh cruelly at Emos given the
opportunity.  I think 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Smith_%28musician%29">Robert Smith</a> looks ridiculous.  But
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_Up">Mixed Up</a>, a 1990 set of
remixes and retakes (I own none of the original versions), which was poorly
reviewed and sank like a stone on the charts, well, it’s just outstandingly
great music.
<i>(“5★♫” series introduction <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music">here</a>;
with <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/23/5-Star-Music#p-1">an
explanation</a> of why the title may look broken.)</i></p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Context</h2>
<p>What the hell, I’m no expert.
Go read the Wikipedia entries and you’ll know more about
Mr. Smith and his hair and makeup and band-mates and context than I do.
I was kind of ignoring English Rock at this point in history, I seem to
remember.  So I have no idea as to the Why or Where.</p>
<p>After I realized I was listening to this disk about as much as any other
electric music in the inventory, and had been for a few years, I thought that
maybe I’d actually like the 
Cure, but I bought a couple of records and didn’t really.  Go figure.</p>
<img src="Mixed-Up-1.jpg" alt="Mixed Up, by the Cure" />
<img src="Mixed-Up-2.jpg" alt="Mixed Up, by the Cure" />
<h2 id='p-2'>The Music</h2>
<p>I was in a record store in 1991 when the totally-hip clerk put on
<cite>Fascination Street</cite>, and I realized I was standing still with my
eyes closed listening to the instrumental breaks.  So I bought it and took it
home and put it on my own high-end system and found my mind expanding rapidly.
Which is to say, this is a triumph of tasteful overproduction.
There is very little electric music that sounds as good, turned up real loud,
as this, and what there is, is Canadian-minimalist, as in the Cowboy Junkies or
Neil Young.  No minimalism here, the stack of layered textures is very deep;
and yet, still lots of room between the notes.  The “Produced by...” and
“Remixed by...” credits are (barely) readable if you enlarge the scan above,
and they’re very complex; but damn, whoever did it, it sounds wonderful.</p>
<p>But I have lots of audiophile showpieces that I never listen to; it’s
music that keeps you coming back.
There are eleven tracks here, seventy-plus minutes of music; some of it’s
divine and the parts that are only OK still sound wonderful.
Here are a few track highlights.  The songs that don’t appear here aren’t
losers, every second of this is fun to listen to.  But here are the
stand-outs:</p>
<p><cite>Lullaby (Extended Mix)</cite>: sets the mood; a cool, spacious, extended,
rhythmically-witty funk workout.</p>
<p><cite>Fascination Street (Extended Mix)</cite>: Oh my goodness, the opening is heroic and
symphonic and danceable all at once; spires of sound topple into shifting
textures of tone and resolve into mainstream guitar-and-drums rock flourishes.
Amazing.
Then the vocals, well yeah, they’re whiny all right (<i>and i'm begging
to drag you down with me
to kick the last nail in</i>), but he’s not holding
anything back, and he’s in the groove and on the beat; there’s genuine
rock-&amp;-roll desperation in the lyrics and it ends up soulful.
Then the big instrumental freight train comes back, with the drums and guitars
and synth bouncing off each other, fast and loud and still with lots of room
between the notes.  Oh, those drums-and-voice interludes.</p>
<p><cite>The Walk (Everything Mix)</cite>: Fast sliding rhythms run ahead of the beat, you
can’t hold still.  The syntho fills are kinda generic, but well-placed.<br/>
<i>Visiting time is over and so we walk away<br/> we both play dead then cry
out loud.<br/> I kissed you in the water<br/> and made your dry lips sing...<br/>
I called you after midnight<br/> then ran until my heart broke.<br/> I passed the
howling woman<br/> who stood outside your door.<br/> I kissed you in the
water...</i></p>
<p><cite>Lovesong (Extended Mix)</cite>: That’s what it is, a nice little sentimental love
song with big sound, well-sung.  Gosh, I feel all Emo, maybe I should grow my
hair over one eye.  Oops, don’t have it any more.</p>
<p><cite>Pictures of You (Extended Dub Mix)</cite>: I gather this was kind of
a hit in its day. On this version, while the arrangement is more than lush,
the instrumentals and orchestrations get out of the 
way and let the singing stand or fall.  For my money, it stands.  And the
bass-line is super.</p>
<p><cite>Never Enough</cite>:  Oh, yes!  To use the parlance of another era:
Maximum Rock And Roll.  Hard guitars, surging bass, desperate vocals.
Well, maybe a little whiny.  But that’s not unprecedented at the R&amp;R
pinnacle, you know (“no satisfaction”, “People try to put us down”, “How does
it feel to be on your own” and so on).</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Sampling It</h2>
<p>Just go buy it. It’s cheap, $12.97 on Amazon when I checked just now.
The sound is too good for MP3 and in terms of minutes of great music per dollar
invested, you just can’t beat it.</p>

<p>Shedding, TDD, Java, and keys.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Shedding</h2>
<p>This is a technique
<a href="http://kasparov.skife.org/blog/src/shedding.html">described by Brian
McCallister</a> which cheats just a little on the meaning of HTTP’s 
<code>302 Moved</code> to do load balancing with some useful server-affinity
side-effects.  In the comments, Sam Ruby points out that a little cheating is
still cheating; but still, the notion is appealing.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Joel, Sigh</h2>
<p>In
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/12/03.html">Part I of his
Yale speech</a>, Joel Spolsky makes an excellent point: that Test-Driven
Development can in principle be oblivious to issues of quality and “coolness”
in the UI, which are obviously important to end-users.  It’s worth
thinking about; but most experts won’t, because Joel makes it
unfortunately clear that he doesn’t actually understand TDD.
Practitioners make no claim whatsoever that TDD “proves” a
program is correct, or that a test suite constitutes a “complete”
specification of the code it’s testing.  Joel makes TDD sound more or less
equivalent to the waterfall method, and the whole point is that it isn’t.</p>
<p>I’ve never heard a TDD advocate argue against functional testing or
integration testing; but I have heard a few of ’em generally diss
UI glitz and glamor and fit and finish.  Which is a real problem.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Java, Sigh</h2>
<p>Check out Michael Kölling’s
<a href="http://www.bluej.org/mrt/?p=34">Can Java be saved from death by
feature bloat?</a> (his argument illustrated in
<a href="http://icedjava.blogspot.com/2007/12/evolution-of-java.html">The
Evolution of Java</a>).
I have decided, after three years, that it’s OK to hate generics, and I am
increasingly drifting into the camp of people like Kölling, who think that the
designers of the Java language should declare victory and just go home
already.</p>
<p>The Java platform is still really interesting, and I have immense respect
for the core design of the language.  But Java 7 has the potential to be
a Great Slither Backward if we’re not careful.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Apple Keyboard</h2>
<p>The new Mac keyboard (the ultra-flat one) is just fab. I can go faster then
with the previous version, and make less mistakes.  Also, the previous
versions had the keys embedded in a kind of a plastic cable, which I found
filled up with crud and crumbs and so on; there’s no place for it to hide on
the new model.</p>
<p>There’s a fly in the ointment; the USB sockets are on the <em>ends</em> of
the keyboard, which is a problem for me since mine sits, with the mouse, on a
dinky little tray hung under the desk; right-left space is precious.</p>

<p>Good legalese, immigration, Lord Black, and Anaheim.</p>

People complain about legalese, lawyer says “OK”, it gets fixed.  Eben Moglen,
get a clue.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Not Born Here</h2>
<p>Via the BBC:
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7128172.stm">One-fifth of
Canadians immigrants</a>.
And here in Vancouver, it’s a whole lot more than 20%; the last tally I heard
said that 46% of the city’s residents weren’t born in Canada.</p>
<p>I try to judge by the evidence, and on the evidence, immigration
is a very good thing.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>78 Months</h2>
<p>It looks like that’s the 
<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2007/12/10/conradsentence.html">sentence 
for Conrad Black</a>.  I've mixed feelings about this; like most Canadians, I
have long loathed
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conrad_Black">Mr. Black</a> for his
lecturing tone, towering arrogance, and 
unbearably-pompous writing style.  I’ve also loathed his wife Barbara
Amiel for over twenty years, since she was an newspaper 
writer in Toronto, reciting the dogma: we should slash
social benefits and labour laws to motivate the poor to work harder, and
simultaneously slash taxes and otherwise send money to the rich to motivate
them to work harder.</p>
<p>It seems pretty clear that Lord Black (what a pathetic thing to do, sliming
into the British House of Lords) was pretty well guilty as charged.
He provides further evidence that extreme right-wingers are, by and large,
scummy greed-heads.</p>
<p>But still, years in jail?  Figuring out some way to strip him of his
ill-gotten gains and make him go out and live among ordinary people would be
much better poetic justice.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Pave It Over</h2>

eye remains just as keen and her touch just as deft.  As, for example, in

<title>Markup Thanks</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I really didn’t pay that much attention to the first OOXML round at ISO,
but I’ve developed a sort of sick fascination with it, leading up to the
potentially-apocalyptic Geneva BRM.  I read the
<a href="http://adjb.net/index.php?entry=entry071209-141310">Kyoto meeting
report</a> from the excellent Alex Brown and it dawns on me that a lot of us
owe some huge debts to people whose names I bet most of you don’t know: James
Mason, Martin Bryan, and Ken Holman.  Here are a few words on them.</p>
<p>XML wasn’t actually invented, it was created by subsetting and fine-tuning
something called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGML">SGML</a>, which had been around
forever and an ISO standard for 
ten years.  For most of SGML’s life, its course was guided by James Mason, and
it wasn’t an easy job: there were at least as many difficult headstrong people
involved as with any other technology subculture.
James is polite and persistent and principled and hard-working and XML just
wouldn’t exist if he hadn’t been there tending the platform we built on.
I gather that in the years since the XML explosion, he’s being doing an
outstanding job of keeping the ISO house in order.</p>
<p>Martin Bryan, as far as I know, is the first human being who ever made a
full-time job out of markup-language technology.  He’s been an organizer and
an evangelist and a tireless standards wonk and his persistence has not failed
over the last twenty years.</p>
<p>Ken Holman, a long-time independent, and totally the guy to call if you need
<a href="http://www.cranesoftwrights.com/">XML-related education</a>,
has been working away on the committees and task forces and other community
service for decades.</p>
<p>All of them are stepping sideways or back, changing roles.  
They’ve already each made more contributions than should really be asked of any
individual, but I hope they have the energy to keep pitching in for a
while yet.</p>
<p>In that
<a href="http://adjb.net/index.php?entry=entry071209-141310">Alex Brown
piece</a> I linked to above, he tips his hat elegantly to James, Martin, and
Ken; it’s worth a read, even if you’re not watching the OOXML drama.</p>

<title>Rock On</title>

<body>
<p>I was leafing through the morning paper looking for coverage of the
<a href="http://music.guardian.co.uk/rock/alexispetridis/story/0,,2225635,00.html">Led Zep
concert</a>, and there were surprises along the way.</p>
<p>First, I ran across a green-politics story with a picture of Australia’s
new Minister of the Environment and it was
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Garrett">Peter Garrett</a>,
formerly famous as the eight-foot-tall lead singer for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Oil">Midnight Oil</a>.  I saw
them live once and he was electrifying.  In the middle of the show the mosh
pit got a little out of control, and Garrett ran to the front of the page,
howling “Somebody’s gonna get hurt!
Throw <em>him</em> and <em>him</em> and <em>him</em> out and give
them their money back, we’ll cover it!”</p>
<p>Then there was this weird little filler story about a wave of European rock
acts citing
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daft_Punk">Daft Punk</a> as a major
influence.  Huh?  Those guys are <em>babies</em>.</p>
<p>For a moment I felt old.  Wait a second; Garrett, a rocker of my own
generation, is a Cabinet Minister.  Make that “grown-up” not old.
And hey, those
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/07/13/LedZep">Led Zep</a>
guys are all ten years older than me, and the reviewers seem to think they can
still rock and roll.  Maybe I have a few tricks left up my sleeve.</p>

<title>XBRL News</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last week I gave a talk at the 16th International
<a href="http://conference.xbrl.org/">XBRL Conference</a> here in Vancouver. 
XBRL is an XML-based system for packing up companies’ financial information,
and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/04/SEC">I think it’s real important</a>.
But its take-off has been kind of protracted
and arduous.  I was there as an Ambassador From the Web.
Here’s a quick XBRL news overview.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Why XBRL?</h2>
<p>Right now a huge number of people in the finance business get PDFs of
company reports of various kinds and spend substantial error-prone time copying
numbers into spreadsheets, so they can think about them properly.</p>
<p>If you package up the numbers in a machine-readable form, everyone can skip
that step, which is A Good Thing.</p>
<p>But the big story is the never-ending war between accountants and
investors.  In any given industry sector, 50% of the companies are performing
below average.  Historically, they have been systematically dishonest about
reporting this; “creative accounting” includes a huge variety of practices for
putting reporting lipstick on various parts of financial pigs.
Investors, on the other hand, want the truth.</p>
<p>If you have a strict and fairly formal machine-readable wrapper for your
financials, that gives investors another club to beat accountants with, which
is A Good Thing.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>XBRL News</h2>
<p>The good news is that the development of all the bits of XBRL you need to
do comprehensive US financial reporting is
<a href="http://www.xbrl.us/press/Pages/120507update.aspx">about done</a>, as
of last week.</p>
<p>The bad news is that less than 100 big public companies (not including Sun,
sigh) are
<a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/xbrl.html">currently reporting in
XBRL</a>, and that there isn’t much in the way of tools to, you know, actually
<em>do</em> anything with the data.
<a href="http://www.irwebreport.com/daily/2007/12/10/my-gibberish-was-first-no-mine-was/">Even view it</a>.</p>
<p>Now, XBRL is complicated, and that’s at least partly because public-company
accounting is complicated.  It also relies heavily on
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xlink11/#xlg">Linkbases</a>, a piece of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLink">XLink</a> technology (disclosure:
with some of my fingerprints on it) that hasn’t had much adoption, so there’s
not much software out there to do things with it.</p>
<p>I’m actually not too worried.  Near as I can tell, the SEC, under the
leadership of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Cox">Chris Cox</a>, is hell-bent on
squeezing XBRL out of public companies whether they like it or not; and once
that information resource is available, tool-builders will arise to do
something with it.  The Americans are well along but lots of other governments
are taking this bit between their teeth.  So, given the existence of the
chicken, there will be possibly-golden eggs.  Stay tuned.</p>

<title>Message From the Web</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last week I gave a talk at the 16th International
<a href="http://conference.xbrl.org/">XBRL Conference</a> here in Vancouver. 
XBRL is an XML-based system for packing up companies’ financial information,
and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/04/SEC">I think it’s real important</a>.
But its take-off has been kind of protracted
and arduous.  I was there as an Ambassador From the Web.  Here’s what I told them.</p>
<p>Of course, this message will be old hat to most readers here, but they’re
still new and strange to lots of people.  And there
are some things you just can’t say too often.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Centralization is a bug</h2>
<p>Bill Joy: “Wherever you work, most of the smart people are
somewhere else.”</p>
<p>The reason the Web worked so well is that nobody had to ask
anybody’s permission to build a browser or a crawler or a search
engine or an auction site or a dating service.  Anything in the system that
requires central authority, that’s something that holds you back.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Good-enough today beats complete next year</h2>
<p>Gall’s Law: “A complex system that works is invariably found to have
evolved from a simple system that worked. The inverse proposition also appears
to be true: A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be
made to work. You have to start over, beginning with a working simple
system.”</p>
<p>There’s a perfect convergence storm, the pressures of quick community
building coming from “Web 2.0” culture and the pressure of quick feature
release coming from the Agile software-development community.  Both of these
are in some part motivated or facilitated by the Web.</p>
<p>If you wait long enough to ship something that solves the whole problem,
nobody will care.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Getting started should be free.</h2>
<p>Also, it shouldn’t take more than a few days.</p>
<p>How much did it cost you to start using Google or Flickr or Facebook or
YouTube?  The answer is always the same.  If you want people to adopt anything
in any scale, you have to remove barriers, and money is one.</p>
<p>Let’s imagine a scenario: There’s a smart young-ish person who has a basic
understanding of business realities and accounting fiction oops
methodology. Let’s call her “Emma”.  Emma decides that people are
underestimating the importance of collecting receivables in Value-Investment
portfolios, and figures out a better way to compute a number that reflects
that.  She lives in Manitoba and doesn’t work for Goldman Sachs, but she can
write CGI scripts.  She has the idea on Wednesday and gets the script working
next Monday, and one quarter later, either gives up on the idea or is
incredibly rich.  Both are good outcomes.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Convince the developers.  Management will go along.</h2>
<p>After all, it was developers who brought in PCs, Unix, Linux, Java, and the
Web.</p>
<p>It’s hard for businesspeople to believe, but it’s true.  CEOs and CIOs and
CTOs don’t really guide technology futures; it’s people with bad hair and bad
T-shirts.  They’re good at finding things that Get Shit Done and figuring out
ways to get them into production, even if that means going through the back
door.  If you’ve got something good, figure out a way to get it in front of
them.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>Try to lock them in and they’ll walk away</h2>
<p>Put it another way: make it easy to walk away, and they’ll come back.</p>
<p>The first generation of commercial Web sites (except maybe
Yahoo!) was managed by people who didn’t understand the Web, and they
developed this deeply pernicious notion of “stickiness”; a successful site was
one that was hard to leave.  I can remember this horrible magazine ad from, I
think, RealAudio, with an actual picture of people stuck to a sphere
representing a Web site.  Gack.</p>
<p>Google has been the best at turning this inside out; making it effortless
to go away, so they come back.  The lesson is obvious: anywhere in a Web site
that there can usefully be a hyperlink to somewhere else, there should be.</p>
<h2 id='p-8'>Some popular tools will be Open Source</h2>
<p>Which raises a question: would you rather provide the popular OSS tools, or
compete with them?</p>
<p>Now, monetizing OSS is hard.  But on the other hand, monetizing
<em>software</em> is hard, always has been.  And doing it while you’re
competing with Open Source is especially hard.</p>
<h2 id='p-9'>To make money, give things away</h2>
<p>Or as this pony-tailed executive I know says: “Monetization at the point of
value.”</p>
<p>There are two kinds of people in the world: those who might do business
with you, and those who never will.  For the second group, you lose nothing by
letting them grab your stuff for free.</p>
<p>The first group is more interesting.  On one hand you have the risk that
they’ll go ahead and use your product or service without ever paying a penny
for licensing or support or indemnification or whatever.  On the other,
there’s the risk that if you make them pay up front, they’ll try something
else that <em>is</em> free-to-try and it’ll be good enough.</p>

<title>Photoworld</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Here’s some reportage from the photoenthusiast side of the brain,
including a shot by an actual real professional (and the difference shows),
Ricoh rumblings, calibration, conversation,
pictures by four different cameras, and two pictures <em>of</em> camera
gear.
I can gang together nearly-unrelated topics in a great big post like this
because photo-hounds will read all of it and nobody else will read any; so
efficiency is maximized.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Ricoh Rumblings</h2>
<p>As noted here, the obsessive-photog world is all a-twitter about the
<a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2007/10/new-gr-digital-.html">Ricoh
GR-D2</a>.  The zillion-dollar question: will it retain the virtues of the
original GR Digital while improving that camera’s miserable low-light
performance?</p>
<p>Pavel Odklizec has been doing some serious testing, and reporting over at
the
<a href="http://ricohforum.com/viewforum.php?f=39&amp;sid=1cde188355160e45cb09732767a51722">Ricoh
Forums</a>.
The early verdict is that the GR-D2 does indeed represent a step forward in
low-light performance, as well as image write speed and some other things
too.</p>
<p>The downside is that its JPEG generator has some really irritating flaws,
and (this is surprising) the prime lens may not actually be as sharp as the
Ricoh GX-100 zoom operating at the same aperture.  Hmmmm.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>After the Rain</h2>
<p>The other day when I gave the XBRL speech, I came out of the conference
building just as a major downpour was easing off and the sun was setting
with the light shooting sideways under the breaking clouds.
The visuals were astounding: gold and blue in the sky, downtown’s glass
buildings reflecting that and the ocean and each other; everywhere big shallow
rainwater pools blazing back flatly.  And, of course, me without any camera;
due to some brain-fart I’d left the pocket-cam at home.</p>
<p>Pulled up at a red light on the way home, I leaned out the window and shot
the rainbow with the camera in my phone; this is the first and I hope the only
cellphone shot to appear here.</p>
<img src="Photo-0012.jpg" alt="Rainbow in rainy winter dusk" />
<p>When I got home, I charged up the stairs, slapped the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/05/24/Pentax-SMC-DA-21mm">wide-angle</a> on
the Pentax, and just managed to catch the last flickers of the sunset.</p>
<img src="IMGP7334.jpg" alt="Trees at sunset" />
<h2 id='p-3'>Lenses</h2>
<p>Following that hasty lens change, the camera guts were scattered naked all
over the table, and I was so amused by the contrast in glass real-estate
between the little
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/04/27/Pentax-P-DA-40mm">40mm/2.8
“Pancake”</a> and the big honking 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/11/15/Sigma-30mm-F1-4">Sigma 30mm/1.4</a>
that I had to take their picture.</p>
<img src="IMGP7341.jpg" alt="Prime lenses: Pentax 21mm/2.8 'pancake' and Sigma 30mm/1.4" />
<h2 id='p-4'>Conversation</h2>
<p>The other Saturday I was reading the paper and noticed that
<a href="http://www.lensandshutter.com/">Lens &amp; Shutter</a>, the biggest
local camera store, was having a mini-trade-show in combination with a big
sale.  So on Sunday I packed up
the baby and went shortly after it opened.  It was very small-scale: they had
tabletop displays, people from Canon and Nikon and Sony and Pentax and Sigma
and Hoya and a camera-case company and a tripod company and some other
accessory vendors.  Then off at the side, the camera store had an unadorned
counter at which they were selling the on-sale goods.</p>
<p>It was really cool, having the selling part and the talking part
separated.  It wasn’t crowded early in the day, and all of the people were
enthusiasts, so the conversations
tended to be pretty deep and obsessive.  I had nice chats with the Pentax and
Sigma people, and I think I may have to pick up one of those wireless Pentax
flashes.  Good on ya, Lens &amp; Shutter; markets <em>are</em> conversations.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Calibration</h2> 
<p>The one thing I did pick up at the show was a
<a href="http://www.colorvision.com/product-mc-s2e.php">Spyder2express</a>
display calibrator.  I only dimly understand the issues around colour, but I
gather that people like me, who care enough to fiddle with prime lenses,
really ought to calibrate, whatever that means.</p>
<p>Now I have.  So I must be A Better Person, right?
After the software and hardware have finished doing their thing,
they show a “before/after” display, illustrating how all your photos used to
look like crap but now look great. I’m a little suspicious of their
objectivity, but things do look a little better.  Well, except for the
mild-straw colour I was using for my Terminal.app background is now a sort of
livid off-mango and must be fixed.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Alex’s Camera</h2>
<p>My friend
<a href="http://www.alexwaterhousehayward.com/">Alex Waterhouse-Hayward</a>
scored an assignment to write about me in my capacity as notorious local
Internet geek for the
<a href="http://www.straight.com/">Georgia Straight</a>, a mostly-harmless
local entertainment-oriented free tabloid.  He took an actual real sit-down
portrait for the purpose, so I got to visit his way-cool studio.  While I was
there I pulled out my little pocket Canon and photographed his big camera:</p>
<img src="IMG_0505.jpg" alt="Alex Waterhouse-Hayward’s Camera" />
<p>Hey Alex, write a piece for us geeks on that camera and its lens and the
tripod and all the other stuff you told me.</p>
<p>You can read Alex’s piece in the Straight but I’d rather send you over to
the
<a href="http://www.alexwaterhousehayward.com/blog/2007/11/tim-bray-father-of-xml-uncle-of-search.html">version
on his blog</a>.  The writing is not as good as Alex’s usually is, because the
<cite>Straight</cite> editors emasculated it.  And the subject isn’t
that interesting.  I’d much rather read Alex writing about
<a href="http://www.alexwaterhousehayward.com/blog/2007/12/william-carlos-williams-ice-boxes.html">refrigerators
and William Carlos Williams</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s the picture.</p>
<img src="Tim-by-Alex.jpg" alt="Tim Bray by Alex Waterhouse-Hayward" />
<p>Amazing what you can accomplish, given real talent and a few decades of practice.</p>

<title>Slow Bonnie</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’ve been noticing that it takes longer and longer to get a meaningful
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Software#p-1">Bonnie</a> run.  To make sure you’ve
busted the filesystem caching and are actually doing I/O, you need to use a
test file two or three times the size of system memory.  Which can easily get
into a couple of hundred gigs on a serious server these days.  And while 
I/O has been getting faster, it still takes a while to process that much data;
and Bonnie does it five times.  So, the ratio that governs Bonnie testing time
is something like memory-size over I/O-performance.  Thus we observe that,
proportionately, memory size has grown faster than I/O speed.
Thus,

<title>Knol</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There’s much ado about
<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/12/encouraging-people-to-contribute.html">Knol</a>,
but I haven’t noticed many Wikipedian voices.  Well, I’ll speak up, and
I’m sort of a Wikipedian.  Actually, less so recently, which is relevant.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Target Audience</h2>
<p>I know <em>exactly</em> who Knol will appeal to.  People like me.  Frustrated
editors.  People who’ve enjoyed participating but find that they’re doing it
less.</p>
<p>When first got interested in Wikipedia, I used to spend the occasional
evening just following the "random article" link and cleaning things up;
and also doing spot quality improvement when I looked something up and saw
flaws or breakage.  I still do a bit of that.</p>
<p>Also, I took responsibility for maintenance of a few articles where I had
expertise:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Vancouver">Vancouver</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/T.E._Lawrence">T.E. Lawrence</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Audiophile">Audiophile</a>.  And, before
I found out that you’re not supposed to edit your employer,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Sun_Microsystems">Sun Microsystems</a>.</p>
<p>I don’t really do that any more, for two reasons.  The first is that, as with
being a serious gamer, being a Wikipedian is increasingly time-consuming.
There is a forest of acronyms, and there are all these macros you can slap on
pages to indicate problems, and they have subtle cultural implications that I
don’t really understand.  For example, as I write this,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T.E._Lawrence">T.E. Lawrence</a> has a
badge at the top saying there’s a neutrality dispute.  So I went and looked at
the (immense, huge, disorganized)
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:T._E._Lawrence">Talk page</a> and
couldn’t figure out who was disputing what.  But I’m no longer confident
enough of Wikipedia culture to just delete the stupid thing.</p>
<p>Second, there are irritants.  People who know less than I about one of
“my” subjects would come along and splash in stupidly-erroneous material, and
people who write less well than I would uglify formerly-clear sentences.
If I were willing to engage them on the Discussion page and do the dance, I
could eventually end up with a good result, but it was kind of discouraging
and very time-consuming.</p>
<p>If I were twenty years younger, with more time and general enthusiasm, it
probably wouldn’t be a problem.</p>
<p>Also, I consider myself thicker-skinned than average, so when someone I
consider an intellectual lightweight says that I misunderstand the Versailles
Conference or phono cartridges, in a rude tone, I don’t let it get me
down.  But there are people in the world, in particular people who’ve
put in the time to grow expertise, who are going to stomp off in a temper.</p>
<p>I bet a <em>lot</em> of them already have.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Solution?</h2>
<p>Those kind of people are going to really like the 
proposition: “I’ll write a carefully-crafted Knol on T.E. Lawrence, those
wankers won’t be able to pee in my pool, it’ll get the link love and I’ll be
the acknowledged authority.  Yee-hah!”  In fact, that very thought crossed my
mind when I read about Knol.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>The Problem</h2>
<p>At the end of the day, I don’t buy it.  Whether or not you like being
edited (and lots of people don’t), on balance the majority of edits are
improvements.  And on balance, most Wikipedia articles are pretty decent.</p>
<p>Yeah, it’s a problem that being a Wikipedia editor is a less-lightweight
activity than it used to be.  But it’s not fatal.  Being a gamer is
less-lightweight too, and Warcraft draws millions.  The fact that I can’t
contribute as easily as I used to irritates me, but at the end of the day
Wikipedia doesn’t <em>really</em> need me, it seems.</p>
<p>Udi’s one of the Really Smart Guys and Knol is a genuinely new approach.
But I don’t think that there’s a really big problem that will drive people
toward it.</p>

<title>Shonen Knife with The Juliet Dagger</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>For the first time in far too long, I went out last night to a club to hear
a couple of rock bands.  Parenthood plus a demanding job really gets in
rock&amp;roll’s way (Lauren had an early Friday and begged off).  The evening
really made me happy and if one of the tour’s last three dates is in your
town, I’d recommend taking them in.  With bad photos and video
even.</p> 
<p>Shonen Knife have <a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/02/06/Shonen-Knife-Burning-Farm">appeared
here before</a>; if you don’t know about them, you might want to step aside
and get the background.  This is the first
<a href="http://localhost/ongoing/What/Arts/Music/5%20Stars/">5★♫</a>
performance that I’ve reported on.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Recording the Event</h2>
<p>At big stadium shows, they don’t want you taking electronics in.  This was
at
<a href="http://www.richardsonrichards.com/">Richard’s on Richards</a>, a
pretty ordinary club with a nice layout that lets quite a few people get
very close to the music.</p>
<p>And it seemed like everybody had a camera of some sort, ranging from
cellphones to big honking SLRs and HD camcorders.  I’ll have to take something
good along to the next club date and make like a hardened rock photog.</p>
<p>I did have
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/04/27/Canon-A710-IS">the little Canon</a> in my pocket.  The pictures
aren’t actually very good, but to my eye they capture the flavor of the event.
Here are Shonen Knife:</p>
<img src="IMG_0588.jpg" alt="Shonen Knife on stage in Vancouver" />
<p>There were three or four bands on the bill but I didn’t go till ten-ish and
only heard the last openers.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Rock Youth</h2>
<p>That would be <a href="http://www.thejulietdagger.com/">The Juliet
Dagger</a> (don’t follow
that link at work with your speakers on).  The name
apparently describes an ad-hoc collection of musicians in support of one Erin
Roberts.  The version last night was Erin and three males:
guitar/guitar/bass/drums.
They were fast and <em>really</em> tight and lively and their tunes were good,
and they had classic fast pure graceful rock&amp;roll stage moves.  Erin’s got
a good voice and tons of charisma, the other guitarists were super-competent,
and the drummer had a <em>massive</em> back-beat.</p>
<p>They were young enough to be my daughter and sons.  And I realized that if
any of them had been, I’d have been proud of them.  
I was happy, so happy, every minute they played.  Realized that two years of
dealing with a tough pregnancy and a sleep-challenged baby had cost me some
connection to the music that’s closest to my heart.   I hope, I really hope,
that I can go on loving Rock&amp;Roll until the day I die.  I’m incomplete
without it.</p>
<p>After their set, they were selling CDs off a table in a corner, so I went
and bought one (<cite>Hi-Ya!</cite>, it doesn’t seem to have a Web home) and
congratulated Ms. Roberts in person.</p>
<p>Here’s a chunk of horrible video, with worse sound, a bit of both bands.
I’m not sure whether to be horrified at the quality or amazed that a little
consumer-grade fits-in-the-pocket gadget can actually do this in such a way
that I can post it to the world the next day.</p>

<h2 id='p-3'>Shonen Knife</h2>
<p>We had two of the three founding members on stage; it was cool that Naoko
and Atsuko are sisters, standing side by side and kicking out the jams.
Here are the good parts: Their songs are great.  Their playing is occasionally
a little wooden, but it gets out of the music’s way and they show no strain in
dealing with those super-fast tempos.  New drummer Etsuko is a ball of fire.
Naoko’s guitar tone is lovely, and she and Atsuko sang beautifully.  They have
a sense of showmanship.
They played <cite>Jelly Bean</cite> and <cite>Twist Barbie</cite> and
<cite>Singapore</cite> (that was the highlight of the night for me).
There’s a new song, <cite>Anime Phenomenon</cite>, that’s really good.</p>
<p>Here are the bad parts: Naoko’s guitar breaks, once you get past that
lovely tone, are weak.  The set was too short, leaving lots of hits un-played,
including <cite>Burning Farm</cite> (!?!?!).
Their outfits were appalling bad-Seventies kitsch.</p>
<p>Then there’s the cognitive dissonance.  Yeah, I know Naoko and Atsuko are
forty-something, but they still present the bright-young-Japanese-girl image,
smiling incessantly. Then those Seventies tunics-and-pants.  Doesn’t really go
with the professed Ramones influence (they even did a song called
<cite>Ramones Forever)</cite>.</p>
<p>It made me think more than anything of David Byrne’s high-velocity
innocence.  And I suspect it’s not an act, that’s the way they really are.
It’s just weird, that’s all.</p>
<p>But for sure they show the music the respect it deserves.</p>

<p>I’d go see ’em again in a flash.  And I really absolutely for sure will go see
some rock&amp;roll on a regular basis, or my soul will start to wither.</p>

<title>On Closures</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I started out nervous with the idea of adding
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_%28computer_science%29">closures</a>
to Java, and I think I’ve slid firmly into the “contra” camp.  One reason is
that it seems increasingly a bad idea to add <em>anything</em> to the Java
language.
On a related subject, my brief sojourn in Ruby-land has changed my thinking
about closures entirely.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Java and Closures</h2>
<p>A good place to start is Bharath’s
<a href="http://infinitescale.blogspot.com/2007/12/bgga-closures-end-of-many-java-careers.html">BGGA closures: The end of many Java careers</a>.
Clearly he’s a contra too, but he links to both sides’ arguments.</p>
<p>My argument is simple: Java worked so well because it hit the 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/01/14/TPSM-8020">80/20 point</a>; for my
money one of the loudest, cleanest 80/20 technology 
victories ever.  Subsequent attempts to fill in the 20% were, well,
mostly harmless. Until generics, which are a disaster; they have made Java
harder to learn and to understand, and you can’t avoid them.</p>
<p>So I’m really scared about trying to chip away any further at whatever’s
left of the 20%.  Also, I look at the motivating examples for closures and I
think that the conventional alternatives aren’t that bad.  Also, I look at the
proposed code and I think that on balance it’ll make Java harder to read.
Also, as Bharath points out, if you really need closures and and
functional-programming goo and suchlike, there are at least two excellent
Java-platform languages that have elegant, well-tested designs: Scala and
JRuby.</p>
<p>But you know, I could be wrong.  Maybe there’s a way to build closures into
the Java language in a way that’ll add power smoothly with no real downside.
If that’s true, we need to discover it and prove it, and the JCP isn’t about
discovering things; it’s about the worst possible place to approach this
problem.  Now that Java is Open-Source, anyone can go cook up whatever loony
closure facility they want, and if it’s good enough, people will start using
it whether the binary build has “Java” stamped on the outside or not, and then
start shouting that it should be in the standard distro, and <em>only
then</em> should the JCP consider going near this tar-pit.</p>
<p>My favorite place to start improving Java wouldn’t be with the language at
all, it’d be the
<a href="http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/announce/2007-October/000016.html">Multi-Language
VM</a> project.  The motivating use-cases for that aren’t theoretical in the
slightest, they have names and addresses and are screaming for love.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Ruby and Closures</h2>
<p>Ruby calls ’em “blocks” and you basically can’t write <em>any</em> code
without ’em.  When you first see how they’re used, you think “Hey, that’s a
nice clean way to do iteration”.  Then when you want to write one of those
functions, you dig in and find out about <code>yield</code>, and you nod your
head “of course”.  </p>
<p>They have to be closures because they look like (and are) chunks of code
embedded in your classes and methods, which can naturally use those
classes’ and methods’ variables.  So there’s nothing in the slightest strange
or surprising.</p>
<p>Later on, when you get a little deeper into Ruby, you find out about
<code>&amp;block</code> arguments and procs and lambdas, but by that time you’ve
internalized the notion that a few lines of code have an independent life even
if they don’t have a name, so the mental effort in figuring it all out is about
zero.</p>
<p>But even in Ruby, to my eyes the most readable of languages, code that uses
procs and lambdas is often hard to read.  (Code that uses ordinary blocks
is trivial to read, the closure-ness is implicit and invisible).</p>
<p>And at the end of the day, the number of times an application programmer is
going to really <em>need</em> a proc or a lambda, to the extent that it’s a win
to suck up the readability cost, probably isn’t that high.
Yes, it happens; I’ve done it myself.  But as I said, not often.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Sorry, I don’t have one.  Ruby proves that it’s possible to get closures
right and make them accessible to grunt programmers.  But if they’re going
into Java, they need to earn their way and be field-tested in the open-source
ecosystem first.</p>

<title>Death Online</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This month has been nasty in the blogosphere; as in sudden-death
nastiness, best summarized by Shelley Powers in
<a href="http://burningbird.net/technology/with-sadness/">With Sadness</a>.
One of the departed,
<a href="http://www.anitarowland.com/">Anita Rowland</a>, was an occasional
contributor here, 
writing me emails before there was a comment system, for example to identify a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/07/02/MadAsHell">crocosmia</a> and an
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/05/23/Three-Flowers">iris</a>.  Bye, Anita.
What, then, about blogs and death?</p>
<p>I see two problems.  First, will your blog survive you?  Second, who writes
the last entry?</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Life After Death</h2>
<p>Dave Winer is insightful on the first subject in
<a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/12/10/futuresafeArchives.html">Future-safe
archives</a>.  He makes an important point: people (like Dave and me) who build
and maintain our own blogging systems are especially susceptible to death
(snicker) in that there’ll be nobody there to keep things running once we’re
gone.  I’m less vulnerable, in that <span class='o'>ongoing</span> is just a
bunch of static files, with a <code>cron</code> job to flip the little picture
on the right side of the page.  I do need to add something to make it easy to
turn off commenting, which by default stays live against anything that’s still
in the Atom feed.  Then I think this might stay around for a while, assuming
someone pays the bandwidth charges.</p>
<p>So, as we get older, anyone who provides a blogging system for other people
to run ought to consider adding a publish-the-whole-thing-as-static-files
option.  I remember when
<a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/blog/">Russell Beattie</a> stopped
blogging for a while a couple years back, he managed to do that: make a flat
static version of the whole thing that just kept running.</p>
<p>On the other hand, people who blog off their own space; say
<code>whatever.blogspot.com</code> or <code>blogs.sun.com/whoever</code>, have
a good chance of speaking to the hereafter.  Hmm, it occurs to me that we’ve
had several thousand people blogging at 
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/">blogs.sun.com</a> since 2004; it wouldn’t be
surprising if one or two of them are now dead.</p>
<p>So, if we can crack the technology nut, then there are the financial
issues; once again, more difficult on your own property.  
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> burns between one and two hundred GB of
bandwidth every month.  I’d expect that to drop off once I’m gone, but not
that fast, and not to decline to zero for quite a while.  So who’s gonna pay?
Maybe I need to think about a Blog Trust and talk to my lawyer.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Last Post</h2>
<p>Over at
<a href="http://www.anitarowland.com/">Anita’s space</a>, there’s a nice final
entry from her husband.
Which is awfully considerate.
On the other hand, some of us might be nervous
leaving the last words to another, and some might even think it unfair to
ask that of our spouse or next-of-kin.</p>
<p>Consider the example of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Pound">Ezra Pound</a>, who devoted
the years between 1915 and his death to a single long series of poems,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cantos">The Cantos</a>, which is
flawed and even horrible in parts, but in other parts my personal favorite
words ever written by anyone.</p>
<p>The last entry in the completed collection is a tiny fragment concerning his
partner Olga; I’ll try to reproduce it (the indentation and spacing are difficult):</p>
<blockquote><p>            <span style="font-size: 120%; font-weight: bold;">T</span>hat her acts<br/>
                           Olga’s acts<br/>
                                        of beauty<br/>
                              be remembered.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
            Her name was Courage<br/>
            &amp; is written Olga<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These lines are for the<br/>
      ultimate CANTO<br/>
<br/>
whatever I may write<br/>
      in the interim.<br/>
<br/>
<i>[24 August 1966]</i></p></blockquote>
<p>I think it might be a good idea to prepare a Ultimate Post, and
instructions for those we trust and love on how to put it online.</p>

<p>What happened was, I got a note from
<a href="http://delirious.ca/">Matt</a> (who runs the 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> server), saying my traffic had suddenly jumped
(to like 230G/month) and wondering why.  I had no idea, so I whipped up a
little Ruby script to break down traffic by resource and host and time-of-day
and so on.  Then I wondered which version of Ruby would run it fastest?</p>

<title>In The Audience</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>At modern high-tech conferences, many in the audience go online, and
stay online during the presentations.  To facilitate this, conference
organizers often provide wireless networking, and extension cords for laptop
power. There is strong disagreement as to whether this A Good Thing or
Appalling Discourtesy.  I have observations both from in the audience and on
the stage.</p> 
<p>At many technology conferences, there is an IRC channel for discussion of
the conference and the sessions.  At particularly bleeding-edge events,
there will be two screens behind the speaker; one displaying the 
visual aids, the other the IRC channel.  I found this particularly weird when
I was speaking at 
<a href="http://jp.rubyist.net/RubyKaigi2007/">last summer’s RubyKaigi in Tokyo</a> and the IRC screen was in Japanese, so I
couldn’t tell what they were saying about me.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>History</h2>
<p>The single greatest influence on my technical career was
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaston_Gonnet">Gaston Gonnet</a>, who
was one of the Directors of the New Oxford English Dictionary Project at the
University of Waterloo, where I was on research staff.  To the extent that I
have any depth of understanding about how computer programs work and how they
should be built, I owe it to him.
We had regular project meetings; at about half of them, he’d show up with some
jottings in a notebook and say “I have an idea” and lots of times it’d be wild
and weird and wonderful.</p>
<p>We used to host the odd conference and attend others, and one time Gaston
said something like this to me: “You know, I get some of my best ideas at
conferences, sitting in
the audience.  You have to be quiet and think about the subject, 
and your brain goes off in useful directions.”</p>
<p>I think this anecdote could be introduced as evidence by both sides of the argument.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>In the Audience</h2>
<p>When I’m in the audience, I’m 100% in favor of connectivity.  At the very
best conferences I go to, there are a very small proportion of speakers who
saturate my ability to listen and think.  It’s a fine thing when it happens,
but it doesn’t happen that often.  I know this is true, and here’s how.
First, there are a few speakers who make me just shut the computer
and listen (most don’t).</p>
<p>For the ones who don’t, quite a few of them are still worth listening to,
only I want to check for hot emails at the same time, or run some test-cases
on misbehaving code, or do a little photo-editing of yesterday’s snaps.  And
then I find myself disagreeing or puzzled and raising my hand (for the kind of
event where you can do that) and getting into dialogue with the speaker.</p>
<p>Then there’s the kind of talk where I suddenly realize that I’ve missed the
last ten minutes because the Internet was more interesting than the
speaker.</p>
<p>How many of these are good outcomes, do you think?</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>From the Stage</h2>
<p>It’s painfully obvious that there are quite a few speakers who don’t really
pay attention to what’s happening in the audience, which to me says don’t
really care how good their performance is.
I’m not one.  When I give a speech and the crowd is responsive and engaged, I
walk away on top of the world, <em>especially</em> when they push back; when
they tune out, I’m crushed.  I have no trouble at all telling which of the two
is happening, and in what proportion of the people facing me.  I don’t think
anyone who actually looks at the individual people in the audience could avoid
knowing how they’re doing.</p>
<p>And I <em>love</em> having the IRC channel on display.  It helps me learn
what’s working and what’s not, and it gives you lots of chances to crack a
first-rate joke based on something in the chat-room.</p>
<p>In my experience, how well I do is a function of how much I care, and of
how well I’ve prepared. Not how <em>much</em>, how <em>well</em>; I struck out on a couple in
the last year because I worked up passionate, erudite, and exhaustive talks
on issues they just didn’t care about.</p>
<p>I haven’t noticed any correlation between how well I do and whether the 
laptops are open when I start.</p> 
<h2 id='p-3'>Entitlement</h2>
<p>The people who think that their audience being Internet-enabled is a bad
thing tend to say 
things like “Being online while someone’s speaking is appallingly rude and
arrogant.  They’ve gone to the trouble of submitting a talk and getting it
accepted and they’re entitled to your attention.”</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>It’s Over</h2>
<p>I’m sorry; the traditional conference mode of discourse, where you sit in
rows in the dark and shut up and listen, it’s just over.  Did I mention that
<em>every</em> respectable geek conference now has wireless and extension cords?
That’s because the audience demands it.  The Audience, near as I can tell,
by and large doesn’t believe that because someone got a talk accepted, they’re
entitled to anyone’s undivided attention.</p>
<p>And let’s be brutal: at most conferences, there are two ways to get a talk
accepted: submit an interesting talk, or bribe the conference organizer.
Oops, sorry: I meant “be a platinum sponsor”.  The conference business is
in many cases deeply corrupt and thus willing to put an airhead
droid in front of paying attendees assuming the airhead’s employer will front
up the cash.</p>
<p>Well, these days, <em>fuck</em> the airhead droid.  I got a laptop and a
connection, I’m gonna tune out unless what’s coming off the stage is relevant
to my experience, and I am the <em>only</em> competent judge of that.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Thought Experiment</h2>
<p>You’ve got several hundred mostly really smart people in a room.
What’s the best use of their time?
Passive listening or active discussion?
Seems obvious to me.
Unconferences,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-space_meeting">Open-space</a>
meetings, once you’ve been to one or two you’ve just had it with this crap
about sitting in the dark facing forward and shutting up.   Participation is
good.  Being spoon-fed isn’t participation.  3½ minutes of
questions from someone else after a 45-minute pitch isn’t participation. 
Silencing all the parts of your mind that aren’t being engaged by the
speaker isn’t participation.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In the audience, I ain’t closing my laptop.
When I’m on the stage, it’s <em>my</em> job to send ’em away happy. If my
mojo’s working, the Internet won’t get in the way. If it’s not, banning laptops
won’t save me.</p>

<title>Megapixel Madness</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I was sitting up late the other night talking to Dave Sifry about his
excellent
<a href="http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/2007/12/beginners_digit.html">Beginner’s Digital SLR buying guide: The Sifry Starter Photo Package</a>.
If you’re thinking “maybe I should get a better camera”, it’s a really good
place to start.  I wanted to add a couple of points and then rant a bit about
the collective insanity around megapixels in camera marketing.</p>
<p>To Dave’s piece, I’d add a few more items of advice:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Dave correctly advises that if you already have some decent lenses, you
might as well get the camera that goes with them.  
I followed that
advice and ended up in the
<a href="http://www.pentaximaging.com/">Pentax</a> world.  
But his piece might leave
you thinking that Nikon and Canon are all there really is.  
Between the two of ’em, they sure enough dominate the DSLR world, but there are
excellent (some of them interestingly off-beat) competitors from Pentax, Sony
(the former Minolta line), Olympus, Panasonic, Sigma, and Fuji.</p></li>
<li><p>There are a ton of good photography-centric places online to help widen
your mind and sharpen your skills with that
new DSLR.  My personal favorite is
<a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/">The Online
Photographer</a>.</p>
<p>It’s hard to avoid
<a href="http://dpreview.com/">Digital Photography Review</a> (everyone says
“DPR”).  They have probably the biggest just-the-facts database on every
which camera you can possibly buy. Their reviews are exhaustive and detailed
and number-laden; and are often criticized for hiding the essence of the
camera behind a cloud of numbers.</p>
<p>Whatever kind of camera you have, there’ll be an online forum for the
people who use it.  These may prove insanely valuable, particularly if you’re
having trouble figuring out how to do something that seems like it should be
easy.</p></li>
<li><p>You’re going to need some software to handle all those pictures you’re
going to be taking.  Macs come with iPhoto, and it’s mostly harmless.  But for
a small fraction of the price of a decent lens you can get
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshoplightroom/">Adobe
Lightroom</a>, which is an absolutely outstanding program for doing 
color-correction and leveling and cropping and sharpening and so on.  It does
pretty well everything you need, it has a wonderful user interface; one of the
nicest things about it is that it’s <em>really</em> fast.</p></li>
<li><p>Pretty soon, you’re going to start hearing people talking about
“Shooting RAW”.  Shooting RAW doesn’t necessarily get you better 
pictures, but does provide opportunities for lots more entertainment in
tweaking them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Megapixel Irritant</h2>
<p>The #1 item that accompanies every digital camera ad—on the web, in your
morning paper, on TV—is the megapixel count.  I’m here to tell you that in
almost every case, the count just doesn’t matter, and when it does, smaller
may be better.  The whole world of cameras would work a lot better if we could
get over this misleading mania.</p>
<p>Why would you want more megapixels, anyhow?  There are two reasons: if you
want to print out your pictures on paper, it takes quite a few megapixels to
fill up a medium-sized print.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many digital photographers (particularly those who shoot with
prime lenses as Dave recommends) like to crop their photos, sometimes reducing
them dramatically in size to focus in on the key visual element.  Obviously,
the more pixels you have, the more you can crop while still leaving behind a
useful picture.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Squares and Square Roots</h2>
<p>I remember the early days of pocket cameras, with one or two MP.
When we suddenly got four and five MP cameras, that was a really big deal,
because the pictures were twice as big or more, on each side.</p>
<p>But remember your high-school geometry?  When you go from five to ten MP,
you double the MP count but only increase the size of the picture by the
square root of two (40% or so) on each side.  And the effect of going from 7
to 10 MP is even less impressive.  To double the size of a 5MP image, you’d
need a 25 MP sensor, which exist but you can’t afford them.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Sensitivity and Crowding</h2>
<p>There are two ways to get more megapixels into a camera.  One is to put
them on a larger sensor; the other is to squeeze them closer together.  Making
the sensor bigger has dramatic effects on the camera body and lens and so on,
and is really expensive.  
If you want to add more pixels, you have Moore’s law on your side, it all
happens down in the silicon.  But there’s no free lunch: as you make pixels
smaller and closer together, you lose sensitivity and increase visual static.
It’s simple enough: big fat pixels with some space between them are better at
gathering the pieces of your picture.</p>
<p>This really hurts when you’re trying to shoot in low light.  There are very
few pocket cameras that can give you a good-looking image when you need to
crank the sensitivity to ISO 800 or more.</p>
<p>The <em>quality</em> of the images produced by my klunky old 6MP Pentax
*ist-D is way higher than the ones from the 7.1MP in my Canon A710IS pocket cam;
the difference is always visible, and it’s particularly dramatic in low-light
shots.</p>
<p>There’s a reason that the real cost-no-object high-end DSLRs (for example
the Canon EOS-1Ds and the Nikon D3) are what is
called “full-format”; the sensor is the same size as a piece of 35mm film,
many times larger than the competition.  People praise these cameras’ high
sensitivity and ultra-fast shooting speed, not pixel counts (although the
Canon has 21.9MP).</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>The Fuji F30 Story</h2>
<p>Take a moment to read Micah Marty’s
<a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2007/12/digicam-appreci.html">Digicam Appreciation</a>;
there was once, a few years ago, a pocket camera from Fuji, the F30, that
everyone agreed had low-light imaging capabilities that totally stood out from
the pack.  Then, as Micah phrases it, “Fuji decided to forgo its primary edge
over the competition (‘Less noise’) in favor of being more like the
competition (‘More megapixels!’).”  The result is that the “classic” F30,
unlike every other now-superseded digicam, is <em>increasing</em> in value, on
EBay for example.</p>
<p>Earth to the camera business: can we get over the megapixels already?</p>

<title>Christmas Eve</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The family gathered this year here with us in Vancouver.
Intimations of mortality occurred, but I’m still glad of the visitors.</p>
<p>The weather this late autumn has been beyond brutal: around 0ºC with 100%
humidity, day after day, the fact that it’s snowing one day, raining the next,
and on Christmas day an unpleasant mix of the two, well those are
just details. You want to go outside, your feet will get wet and cold, suck it
up and deal with it.  “If we didn’t like this crap we wouldn’t have moved out
here” is what we say.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Mortality</h2>
<p>On top of which, a nasty stomach flu ripped through the family, only
attaining 30% coverage but that was still pretty disruptive.  And then a loved
one a couple of timezones away seems to be slipping over the edge of the
Alzheimer’s slope in a situation where we can’t easily, or even with
difficulty, pitch in and help.  To top things off, a cruel disease that won’t
kill you but really fucks up your life leaned in where we thought it’d
been cured, on Christmas Eve morning.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Sunshine</h2>
<p>It broke out Christmas Eve around noon, so we loaded a van with everyone
who wasn’t barfing or prostrate or on caregiver duty and went to the beach.
Remarkably few other Vancouverites were there, given the rarity of light these
last few weeks.
One of them was determined to enjoy the rays to the max.</p>
<img src="IMGP7363.jpg" alt="Kitsilano beach, Christmas Eve 2007" />
<p>Come next year, most of us are still going to be alive and getting up
in the morning and doing what we have to do.
For now, snatch the rays of winter sun and the moments you get with the ones
you love, because when those things are gone they don’t come back.</p>

<title>Upcoming Gig: CUSEC 2008</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is the Canadian University Software Engineering Conference.  They
accosted me out of the blue at some conference last fall and said “Come to
Montréal in January?”  I love academic crowds and it seemed like a good and
well-organized event, so I’ll be at
<a href="http://2008.cusec.net/">CUSEC 2008</a> speaking at 10 AM on January
17th.  They seem well-enough organized not to need a plug from me, but today I
dropped by the
<a href="http://2008.cusec.net/en/speakers.php">speakers roster</a> and well,
oh my goodness.  I’m in damn fine company.  I’d pay real money to hear what
these other people have to say.  Going to have put some extra work into my
preso or I’ll look lame.</p>

<title>TV and the LazyWeb</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I have a problem: I want a new HDTV, I have very specific requirements,
and I’m not which models match, or even how best to find that out.
There’s always the LazyWeb, and it’s
showing new signs of life, in the form of Dave Sifry’s
<a href="http://www.hoosgot.com/">Hoosgot</a>.  Let’s see if it can help me
find the right TV.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The TV Problem</h2>
<p>I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/10/05/KrashTV">bought an HDTV setup</a> to
watch the 2004 World Series; a Hitachi plasma set with only 480 lines of
native vertical resolution.  For its original purpose, watching high-def
sports broadcasts, it works just fine.  Based on what I’ve seen on other sets,
even the latest 1080p sets, I’m not sure that the nominal-1080
coming out of the satellite receiver has much more to offer than the Hitachi
can handle; and in any case it seems like there’s
<a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-6449_7-6810011-1.html">not much of a
case</a> for going past 720p in my form factor (see #2 below).</p>
<p>But there are two apps for which I really want the 1080.  First, my
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/05/08/Video">video camera shoots 1080i</a>.
Second, I want to use the TV for outboard display of my pictures.  I grew up in
a family where we took slides and sometimes set up the screen and projector
for a family
slide-show.  I liked that and want to recreate it, and the current screen does
a really bad job.
Also, it looks like 1080p is a technology plateau that should last for a while.
So here are my requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>1080p.</p></li>
<li><p>There’s only one place in the house to put it, so it can’t be more than
about 41 inches wide, which means 42" in whatever 
units they use to measure TV screens.</p></li>
<li><p>Needs to be really shallow, which
means either plasma or LCD I guess.  When I go to the stores, it seems that the
LCD screens please my eye a little better, but probably either would be
OK.</p></li>
<li><p>Needs to be suitable for watching live sports via satellite (but this
seems pretty well a wash with the good modern sets).</p></li>
<li><p>Needs to appear to my Mac as a 1920x1080 display, no fuss, no muss, no
<a href="http://www.madrau.com/html/SRX/indexSRX.shtml">SwitchResX</a>.
They say DVI input
is better than VGA, but I’m not sure I can see that.</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple inputs is good.  Currently we have the DVD player, the
satellite, the Wii, and the DVI wire all plugged in, and I have to unplug one
to plug in the camera, which sucks.  I may have to get some sort of video switcher/receiver.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There you have it.  I’ve done some poking around and it’s gonna be laborious
to find a box matching all the above.  But I bet there are quite a few Mac
owners out there who could put up their hand and say “Hey Tim, my
Pioneer or Sony or Toshiba or whatever is just the ticket”.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Hoosgot</h2>
<p>Hoosgot (<a href="http://www.hoosgot.com/index.php/about/">About page</a>)
scans the Technorati flow (including blog feeds and twitters) for anyone
mentioning its name or “LazyWeb” (thus, it
<a href="http://www.hoosgot.com/index.php/2007/12/31/tv-and-the-lazyweb/">includes</a> the article you are
now reading), and aggregates
short summaries.  Obviously, credit is due to Ben Hammersley for the original
<a href="http://www.lazyweb.org/">LazyWeb</a> idea.</p>
<p>If it becomes popular at all, <em>subscribing</em> to Hoosgot will become
untenable.  I currently follow it on Twitter and even in its pre-announce
phase, it’s kinda noisy.</p>
<p>I suppose the notion is that if it gets some traction, it’ll develop good
Google-karma and someone like me, looking for a TV (or for an android assistant
or blues bassist or chlamydia cure) might turn up the answer on Hoosgot.
Anyhow, it belongs at the very least in the “worth watching” category.</p>
<p>Something else interesting; I note that that Dave used WordPress to build
the front-end for this new thing.  I wonder what other strange and wonderful
uses will emerge for well-engineered personal publishing platforms.</p>

<title>What the Pope Can’t Do</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Was listening to an argument and someone said “Gimme a break. Even the Pope
has to put his pants on one leg at a time!”  And I thought that was incredibly
lame.  To start with, the Pope wears a dress, everyone knows that.  And this
afternoon, I was changing my 18-month-old, and once the underneath
layers had been put back together, held her pants up to her
feet.  She considered them, then coolly thrust both legs through at once, her
tiny bare pink toes emerging without a hitch.  And who cares what
the Pope can’t do, anyhow?</p>

<p>I contributed to the

true that, as
<a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/2007/12/version_identifiers_reconsider.html">Noah
Mendelson suggests</a>, its advice that data formats version themselves is,
well, wrong.  I spent some years of my life helping design

<p>There’s this guy named Bob Aman whom I’ve only met once, but I’m a 
fan.  He’s maniacally determined that Ruby shall have the world’s best
URI-handling library, so he’s building it, and it’s called
<a href="http://addressable.rubyforge.org/">adressable</a>, which is
a good name.  I was sitting on the floor talking to the RSpec guys at the last
RubyConf and Bob plunked himself down and started wondering out loud about the
best way to manage his many thousands of test cases.  Someone who’ll write
thousands of test-cases for URI wrangling is totally OK by me.</p>

<p>GlassFish, the Open-Source instantiation of the Sun Java Application

as I know, Sun didn’t even know this was happening.  Gotta like that.</p>
<p>There’s an internal Sun mailing list I’m on that’s concerned with
government technology policy, and I keep seeing stories go by about
governments liking Open Source and Open Data Formats, often confusing the two
laughably, but still, it’s a real trend.  One particularly tasty example is

<title>2008 Prediction 1: RIA vs. AJAX</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>What happened was, a sudden email from Sun PR went around about fifteen
minutes to Christmas saying “SYS-CON
wants predictions for 2008; right now would be good.”  It happened that I was in
the middle of doing three months and ten trips’ worth of expenses, thus bored
out of my mind, thus happy to prognosticate.  I gave them
<a href="http://java.sys-con.com/read/478303.htm">five</a>, but, given the
urgency, not much more than sound-bites.  I think each of them is
worth a little exegesis.</p>

Networking</a>.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id='p-1'>Prediction</h2>
<p>The short version:</p>
<blockquote><p>There's a major struggle going on between “RIAs” (Rich Internet
Applications) and AJAX, which tries to do everything in the browser using just
what the browser ships with. RIA frameworks are AIR (“Flash, the Next
Generation”), Silverlight (“Microsoft wants in”) and JavaFX (“Isn't
open-source better?”) I'm not brave enough to predict who wins, but I do
predict that 2008 will be a crucial year; either RIAs enter the mainstream, or
they start to smell like a red herring left in the sun.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id='p-2'>Suspicion</h2>
<p>Ever since we’ve had the Web, we’ve had those who say it’s Not Good Enough.
I’ve long been among the RIA skeptics, for a couple of reasons.  First, let me
quote myself, from
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/05/19/Continuations-and-GUIs">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This notion, that the Web GUI is insufficiently interactive and
we need something richer, is widely held among developers and almost never
among actual users of computers, and it’s entirely wrong. I can remember when
people were forced to use compiled Windows and X11 applications, and most of
them were extremely bad because it’s really hard to design a good interactive
UI; when the Web came along, more or less everyone abandoned those UIs in
favor of the Web, almost instantly and with shrieks of glee. Yes, Web UIs are
drastically constrained, offer a paucity of controls, and enforce a brutally
linear control flow; and these are good things. I remember, in the early days,
people saying “Once you know how to use one Windows app, you know how to use
them all”. Ha ha ha. But you know what? Once you know how to use a browser,
you are well on the way to being able to use most Web apps. The best AJAX apps
are still very Web-like (as in, the Back button always works); but they’re
faster and more responsive and nicer to look at. The worst AJAX apps are like
bad Nineties VB.</p></blockquote>
<p>I stand by my point: the people who want to add UI “richness” to the Web
are always developers, never users.  Doesn’t mean they’re wrong; after all,
the users weren’t clamoring for the Web before it arrived, either.</p>
<p>My other problem is that while I like my Internet applications to be rich,
I have this old-fashioned notion that “richness” is mostly about 
compelling words and pictures and sounds and especially, most especially,
interaction with living people.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>On The Other Hand</h2>
<p>I use Rich Internet Applications all the time.  Mail. iTunes.  In fact all
rich applications have become Internet applications: I can publish 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> fragments with a keystroke in Emacs, and create
a Web slide-show from Lightroom.</p>
<p>But that’s not what they mean when they say RIAs; they mean “Whatever lies
in the direction that Flash is pointing.”  Which puzzles me, because near as I
can tell, Flash is most useful for watching movies portably (a la YouTube) and
cool casual games like
<a href="http://www.harveycartel.org/metanet/n.html">N</a> and
<a href="http://www.handdrawngames.com/DesktopTD/Game.asp">Desktop Tower
Defense</a>.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>But I Could Be Wrong</h2>
<p>I’ve always seen it as a big problem that at the end of the day, Flash is
proprietary.  So is Silverlight (although it’s <em>damn</em> interesting that
it runs on OS X).  JavaFX tries to remove that problem.  Maybe if we unleash
the creativity of all the people who just don’t want to be
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/07/12/WebsThePlace">sharecroppers</a> on someone else’s
plantation, we’ll see some RIAs that are actually interesting to business.</p>
<p>But don’t kid yourself that it’ll be easy.  The browser already offers what
most people (who aren’t software developers) consider an excellent user
experience, and AJAX, done well, makes it even better.</p>

<title>Now That’s a Patch</title>

<body>
<p>I refer to Sam Ruby’s
<a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/2007/12/31/Porting-REXML-to-Ruby-1-9">massive
patch</a> to make REXML work properly with the latest Ruby.
I’ve long disliked REXML (see
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/17/Why-JRuby">here</a> and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/22/REXML">here</a>), but it’s here and it
works.  Only the <em>way</em> it works changed in 1.9, and there were some
horrible regressions, and it gets patched very slowly.  (I’m actually wondering
why Ruby needs to have a weird regex-based parser when Expat is plenty good
enough for Perl and Python, and in fact if you look at
<code>xmlparser.rb</code>, you can switch parsers, just as Nick Sieger has done for
JRuby with
<a href="http://caldersphere.rubyforge.org/jrexml/">JREXML</a>.
But I digress.) 
In the short term, we need to see if the REXML maintainers are responsive
to Sam’s patch.</p>

<p>Around our house, we have screens connected to Windows XP, OS X, and Ubuntu
GNU/Linux.
Ubuntu and OS X are easier to install, less trouble to maintain, and more
pleasant to use.  If we were tracking the time we spend maintaining these
things, I’m willing to bet that Windows takes more care &amp; feeding than the
other two put together.  Down the road we’ll have Windows only for games, I
think.</p>
<p>We also provide tech support for our mothers, a local Pilates studio, and
various random friends, local and remote.  Wherever we can, we’re steering them
to OS X just because they’ll experience less pain and be more productive.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Pain</h2>
<p>These days, when you live mostly on OS X &amp; Ubuntu, XP is just
incredibly irritating.  There’s always something pestering you to update it:
Adobe, Java, Norton, whatever.  Plus random other whining from the bottom right
corner of the screen, about unused icons and firewall security and so on.</p>
<p>As for my family &amp; friends who aren’t pros, and who haven’t been under
the tutelage of one either, their Windows boxes are mostly smoking, diseased,
quivering heaps of goo.  Who’s got the time to deal with that shit?</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Why I Might Be Wrong</h2>
<p>I haven’t spent any time with Vista.  Possibly, after a couple of releases,
it’ll make Windows competitive again.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>From the Business Point of View</h2>
<p>I talk to the individuals and small businesses who are still running Windows,
and I compare them to those who’ve escaped, and it’s just not close.  Recently
I was helping Mairin get her system set up—a Mac mini, which BTW is a fabulous
computer for a small business—and was showing her how to do
something and she said “But that’s so easy?  Why?” and I said “Well, that’s
how things work on this system” and she said “Well, why are people still using
Windows then?”</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>The Future</h2>
<p>Microsoft’s continuing extraction of monopoly rents is dependent, near as I
can tell, on just two things:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>MS Office staying good enough that people don’t
mind paying the fearful Windows tax that goes with it.  Except for, Office
runs better on OS X than on Windows.</p></li>
<li><p>The Exchange/Outlook lock-in.  This seems the big one to me.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id='p-8'>Like I Said</h2>
<p>This problem is becoming increasingly impossible to ignore.  Especially now
that nearly everyone has someone in the family with a Mac.</p>

<p>Our traditional (well, this is the third in four years) New Year’s Day
social went off very nicely, thank you.  We had RSVP’s from 40 or so adults
with at least ten kids.  Things that we kept the same:
<a href="http://www.mumm.com/champagnes/?page=nos_champagnes_cordon_rouge">Cordon Rouge</a>,
gazpacho, lentil soup, and coffee cake.  Innovation:
hiring a real babysitter to hang out upstairs with the kids.  Emma was great
but went home looking frazzled; there are still a few nerf darts on the
ceiling.</p>
<p>Here’s a shot of part of our front hall once things were well under way.</p>
<img src="IMGP7423.jpg" alt="Assembled shoes and other paraphernalia in the front hall during party" />
<p>Thanks everyone for coming, and if our invite went astray or you slipped
our minds, sorry.</p>
<p>We’re thinking of maybe shifting it to the summer solstice when it’s not so
dark and cold and awful and the kids can go out in the yard.</p>

<body>
<p>It’s
<a href="http://zyasoft.com/pythoneering/2008/01/django-on-jython-minding-gap.html">starting
to happen</a>.  There’s a long way to go between successfully executing a
bit of Rails and actually making the sucker run usefully, as
the JRuby guys will tell you.
But speaking of JRuby, there are some eerie similarities: a language-platform
project that was promising, then drifting, now revitalized.
The ecosystem gets more interesting all the time.

<title>2008 Prediction 3: Rails Rules</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is the third of five predictions for 2008, expanded from the short
form generated on short notice as 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2008/01/01/Predictions">described here</a>.
</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Prediction</h2>
<p>The short version:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rails will continue to grow at a dizzying speed, and Ruby will
in consequence inevitably become one of the top two or three strategic choices
for software developers. But at the same time, other frameworks and tool-sets
are learning its lessons, so Rails will get some serious
competition.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id='p-2'>I Hear a Very Gentle Sound</h2>
<p>I don’t know anyone who’s actually doing methodologically respectable
head-counts of Web developers, so any opinion from anyone is based on anecdotal
evidence at best.  But these days, based on <em>my</em> anecdotal evidence,
everything I see and smell, the white-hot
pace of Rails adoption isn’t slowing down at all.</p>
<p>Rails drags Ruby along behind it, and good programmers who are exposed to
Ruby tend to become addicted pretty quickly.</p>
<p><i>[Hoisted from Comments]</i> Joe Gregorio
<a href="http://bitworking.org/news/282/Tim-Bray-on-Ruby-on-Rails">argues</a>
that Rails peaked in mid-2006 and is now declining.  But read his comments,
too.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Who’s Watching</h2>
<p>There is one group of technologists who are now 100% familiar with Rails.
I’m speaking of the developers of competitive Web frameworks, many of whom
felt somewhat smacked upside the head by Rails’ sudden noisy chomp into their
market share.</p>
<p>By and large, they’re not stupid.  They may not have been as quick to
notice the things that DHH and the other Railsists noticed, but they’ve
noticed them now, and more or less every other piece of the Web ecosystem has
something “Rails-like” in hot development or in production.  Some of the names
to watch are
<a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> (based on Python), 
<a href="http://liftweb.net/">lift</a> (based on Scala), and
<a href="http://grails.codehaus.org/">Grails</a> (based on Groovy).
But I predict fearlessly that there will be a Real Important Web-framework
grabbing mindshare a year from now that’s learned Rails’ lessons but ain’t one
of those.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>I Could Be Wrong</h2>
<p>Maybe the population of developers will wake up, shake their heads, and say
“Nah, going back to PHP, it’s faster” or “Actually, now I see that Java EE’s
XML configuration files are da bomb”.</p>
<p>But I don’t think so.</p>

<title>2008 Prediction 4: PHP Problems</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is the fourth of five predictions for 2008, expanded from the short
form generated on short notice as 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2008/01/01/Predictions">described here</a>.
</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Prediction</h2>
<p>The short version:</p>
<blockquote><p>PHP will remain popular but its growth will slow, as people get
nervous about its maintainability and security stories.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ambivalent, that’s me; I totally have a love/hate relationship with PHP.</p> 
<h2 id='p-1'>Yes, ...</h2>
<p>It’s enabled
huge numbers of people to create decent Web sites without having to learn too
much or try too hard; a very good thing.  Also, it runs pretty fast.  Plus,
it’s been used to build some of the most instructive and useful apps out
there, like MediaWiki and WordPress.</p>
<p>So I totally think PHP has earned its huge community and thriving ecosystem
fair and square; good on it.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>... and No</h2>
<p>On the other hand, speaking as an actual computer programmer, I really
dislike PHP.
I find it ugly and un-modular and there’s something about it that encourages
people to write horrible code.  We’re talking serious maintainability pain.</p>
<p>Also, I observe a certain amount of tension involving the
community and Zend.  
Symptoms may be observed, among other places, at
<a href="http://www.hardened-php.net/">hardened-php.net</a>.
I was going to drop in a wry comment about the
elusiveness of “The PHP Group” who own all the copyrights and so on, and just
now failed to find a pointer to the
page which lists them (I know it exists, I’ve seen it), so I guess that’s
self-referentially wry enough. 
And you have to raise your eyebrows over the course of the transition from
PHP4 to PHP5.</p>
<p>Finally, some recent hands-on experience: a big project I’m peripherally
involved with needed to include an outward-facing Wiki, and I suggested that
MediaWiki was damn good stuff.  They put in quite a bit of work and failed to
get MW to integrate with the rest of the system.  Yes, it’s a good wiki, but it
shouldn’t have been that hard to make it play nice with others, and I got the
impression that the PHP-ness of it was a big part of the problem.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>I Could Be Wrong</h2>
<p>At the 2006 Zend conference, Andi or Zeev (I forget which) took a question
about Rails and said “Ruby is appropriate for computer-science-loving people
who have a puristic attitude.”  Maybe that’s all there is to it.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Under My Sun Hat</h2>
<p>I think we need to do a much better job of
supporting PHP natively in Solaris and NetBeans and so on up and down the
stack.  But at the same time, I can’t honestly encourage people to use it for
building anything new.</p>
<p>And I think I’m far from alone in that impression.</p>

<title>2008 Prediction 5: Social Networking</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is the fifth of five predictions for 2008, expanded from the short
form generated on short notice as 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2008/01/01/Predictions">described here</a>.
</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Prediction</h2>
<p>The short version:</p>
<blockquote><p>There will be massive, newsworthy, churn in the
social-networking space, as Facebook creaks under the strain of its own size
and growth, and nimbler competitors find chinks in its armor.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id='p-1'>Told Ya So</h2>
<p>This one came true within a week of me making it:
<a href="http://scobleizer.com/2008/01/04/erased/">Scoble got erased</a>.
Yes, there are multiple sides to that issue.  But it’s a hot issue
nonetheless; since Facebook and its competitors are trying to become the
experience of the Internet for a huge number of people, minor disturbances in
that weather system quickly become major issues.</p>
<p>Let me crank that prediction up a bit: The Scoble imbroglio will be just
one of many Social Networking Scare stories this year.</p>
<p>Hold on a second... there’ve been two already since that one blew up.
From Toronto, 
<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2008/01/04/rengel-facebook.html?ref=rss">serious
legal-disclosure issues</a> and from Fortinet,
<a href="http://www.fortiguardcenter.com/advisory/FGA-2007-16.html">insecure
Facebook apps</a>.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Lesson Is</h2>
<p>Leave a gap, as I did, between making your predictions and expanding on
them. Some of them might already have come true.</p>

<p>I just made my annual donation to

MS Office and OpenOffice.org and ODF documents on the Mac and you don’t want
to buy any overpriced opaque binaries, it’s your best bet.  The
new news
is that that the latest NeoOffice (2.2.2) startup is irritatingly slow on my
2GHz MacBook.  Which, you see, is <em>good</em> news, because previous
combinations of older NeoOffices and older Macs started up painfully,
agonizingly, slow.  For those of us who live on the Web, at this point in
history it’s hard to feel much love for office-doc processing software; but of
its kind, Neo is really not bad.</p>

<p>There’s a boring press release; and interesting write-ups from

Reinacker</a> and
<a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3461">Brent Simmons</a>.
(Oh, and why is it we need press releases any more?)
This is interesting on a bunch of grounds.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Why a Newsreading Client?</h2>
<p>There are those, hardwired to Google Reader or some such, who genuinely
don’t understand why someone would use client software at all.  Google Reader
is just fine, but I still haven’t seen anything that gets me the news anywhere
near as fast or as flexibly as NetNewsWire.  Well, and it makes offline catch-up
very easy, but mostly it’s just about the speed.  If you’ve got a job where
you need to soak up a big news-flow without wasting much time, and you’re on a
Mac, you really ought to give NNW a try.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Business Model</h2>
<p>Why would you give away popular 
software?
Quoting Greg Reinacker: “What we’re working to do is to saturate the market
with our clients.”  Which makes excellent sense; because they’re really in the
server/service business.</p>
<p>Plus, they think they can do something interesting with attention data.
Not the first time I’ve heard that, and it’s sure plausible, although I’m not
sure anyone’s actually making much hay with it just yet.</p>
<p>But hey, thanks guys.</p>

<h2 id='p-1'>Rubinius</h2>
<p>First of all,
<a href="http://blog.fallingsnow.net/">it runs IRB</a>; I remember the JRuby
guys having surprising difficulty there; thus this has to be a real milestone.
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.engineyard.com/">Engine Yard</a> is Rubinius World
Headquarters, and they just
<a href="http://www.engineyard.com/2008/1/11/engine-yard-benchmark-capital">took
a butt-load of money</a> from Benchmark Capital.
Frankly, I’m dubious about the value of most Venture Capital investments in
the modern Web economy; but if it keeps Rubinius moving along it’s A Good
Thing.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Rails</h2>
<p>Shortly after I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2008/01/03/Prediction-Rails">predicted good times
for Rails</a>, there was the infamous
<a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/rants/rails_is_a_ghetto.html">Zed rant</a>
which is worth reading, not for the morsels of truth possibly burrowed in the
billows of bile, but for the flame itself, which is monumental in its scope
and ambition.  Sample: “Jesus fucking christ on a goddamned pike you absolute
mother fucking donkey dick sucking morons get a fucking grip!”
The production is so obviously staged that it’s hard to get mad at its
infantile drama-queen rhetoric; but I’ll make an exception for Zed’s dissing
the people coming over to Rails from PHP; it’s a <em>good</em> thing if people
who haven’t spent years on the theory can still build decent Web sites.</p>
<p>For the kinder, gentler, Zed, read Joe Gregorio’s
<a href="http://bitworking.org/news/282/Tim-Bray-on-Ruby-on-Rails">Tim Bray on
Ruby on Rails</a>, which sees Rails as being in decline (but read Joe’s
commenters too).
I find that really hard to believe, since more or less everything Web-related
is growing, it’s the relative speeds that matter; but the January
<a href="http://www.tiobe.com/tpci.htm">Tiobe Index</a> is interesting.
Python, you know, not much hype but lots of real work getting done.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Frameworks</h2>

Web APIs: Exploring REST and WOA in Rails 2.0</a>.  Dion deploys a few too
many words and pictures for my taste, but the graphic entitled “21st Century
Web Development” is thought-provoking.</p>

<p>Welcome to the 2008 dispatches-from-the-front flow.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Imagine There’s No Heaven</h2>
<p>The resurgence of outspoken mainstream atheism the last couple of years is
a genuinely New Thing in my lifetime, and just possibly in history.  It seems
like there’s
something going across my radar every week.  This week, 
<a href="http://outcampaign.org/">The OUT Campaign</a> and the admirably
level-toned 
<a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/~ssyreeni/atheist/no-ghost-c-04">A Blunt
Atheist FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>My eight-year-old boy says he’s a Christian and is going to heaven when he
dies; which I have nothing against.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Olympics</h2>
<p>They made a big splash about this up here in Canada last week:
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/mapledesk/entry/sun_microsystems_canada_gets_the">Sun
Gets the 2010 Olympic Games</a>, which means we have some sort deal, terms
doubtless <em>never</em> to be disclosed, to supply the server
infrastructure.</p>
<p>Not all is sweetness and light around the Olympics.  The 2008 version in
Beijing will be made available online; but
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2008/01/07/2008-olympics-brought-to-you-by-silverlight.aspx">only
via Silverlight</a>.  Which means that if you use a Linux or Solaris box, or
one of the few million pre-Intel Macs that are still out there, the Olympic
Community doesn’t want peons like you on board.  This seems scandalous to me,
but nobody else seems to care.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Music</h2>
<p>I’ve written before of Ambient Internet Brain Goo, downtempo background
groove via the Net.   The last couple of weeks I’ve been enjoying
<a href="http://www.epiphanyradio.org/">EpiphanyRadio</a>; very superior goo
indeed.</p>

<a href="http://www.firestoneaudio.com.au/products/products/dacs.html">Firestone
Audio’s “Fubar” DA Converters</a> look seriously cool; I want one.</p>

<a href="http://www.artisansakemaker.com/">Osake</a>, where they do
small-batch sake craft brewing.  I bought a bottle and it was good; what
a nice surprise, and very Vancouver.</p>
<p>And then just last week we were going to get take-out sushi so at random I
grabbed a bottle of “Yoshi” Junmai sake from Yoshi-No-Gawa, which isn’t on the
Net (in English at least) but poking around reveals the family has been in the
sake business since 1200 and the current brewery operating since 1548.
It was absolutely superb, I recommend it whole-heartedly.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Middle East</h2>
<p>Dubya can sweep in and out all he wants and if he actually manages to move
Israelis and Palestinians to ignore their respective War Parties good on him.  
In the interim, Daniel Barenboim has
<a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=944235&amp;contrassID=1&amp;subContrassID=1">taken
out Palestinian citizenship</a>.  He’s

The factions of madmen may block the path of the sane majority, but they
can’t drown out the noble voices.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Jeremy!</h2>
<p>Zawodny, that is, who got
<a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/009832.html">married in
Zanzibar</a>; what a great picture.  Congratulations and best wishes, and I
hope to meet Kathleen some day.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>Phil Agee</h2>
<p>He died Jan. 7th, without much in the way of flashy obituaries.
Mr. Agee certainly shifted my
world-view, and that of many others, with his 1975 book <cite>Inside The
Company</cite>, which described, in calm-voiced irrefutable detail, how the
United States, as a matter of policy, for many decades encouraged evil
dictators (as long as they were anti-Communist), helpfully funding the
suppression and murder of any democratic opposition.   There’s not much news
value left here, but reading it will sure help you understand why there are
two or three generations of Latin-American leaders with a major grudge against
the USA.</p>

<title>Upcoming Gig: ISO OOXML BRM</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’ve been invited to join the Canadian delegation to the
<a href="http://adjb.net/index.php?entry=entry080107-183411">DIS 29500 Ballot
Resolution Meeting</a> in Geneva in February.
This is a consequence of having joined the expert group supporting the
<a href="http://www.scc.ca/en/index.shtml">Canadian National Standards
Body</a>; I haven’t
quite figured out the forest of acronyms and organizations yet, or how things
fit together.
Given the white heat of politics and verbiage around this process, I’m going
to accede to the request of a couple of Very Smart People who’ve asked me to
hold off on real-time blogging.  Which I’m comfy with,
since I’m an ISO newbie and don’t know the process or the culture.  
I will say, though, that I am <em>not</em> representing Sun officially, the
Canadian Standards people contacted me and I checked with our corporate
Standards group and said that I wanted to go and would only go if I were free
to offer my own technical opinions on technical issues; they were OK with that.
I’ve been
stuffing my brain with the OOXML comments and proposed resolutions, and the
picture is interesting; I’ll write at length once I figure out how to do so
without breaking anything.</p>

<title>Leopard Love</title>

<body>
<p>You know, I spend quite a bit of time in this space dissing OS X, but I’d
have to say that Leopard has been one of the more pleasant infrastructure
surprises in recent years.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Time Machine</h2>
<p>I just now typed <code>rm -rf *</code> in the wrong directory, and no more
than ten seconds after saying “Oh, <em>shit!</em>” I thought hey, hold on a
second... and another ten seconds later I had revivified the victims.</p>
<p>You gotta love that.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Mail and Calendar and Phone</h2>
<p>At some point in the last year when I wasn’t looking, my Samsung phone
showed up on the list of devices supported by iSync.  So for the first time in
years, I have my whole calendar and telephone book there on the phone.  I am a
Fully Integrated Person.  By the way, at least on this phone, an event’s
“Location” field is strictly limited in size; if you need to put in a couple
of phone numbers or directions to the meeting, use the “Notes” slot.</p>
<p>But what’s really cool is that these days, if there’s a date or a time in
an email message, you can click on it and it’ll make an effort to figure out
event details and jam them into
iCal automatically.  It gets lots of things wrong, but usually not the time,
so at least you get an event opened up at the right place in the screen, so
you can fix up any mistakes and put the details in the “Notes” field.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Spotlight</h2>
<p>You know, now that it works (never did in Tiger for me), Spotlight is
actually a pretty great feature.  I organize everything by timeline, YYYY/MM,
under a very few top-level directories like “Sun”, “Pictures”, and “Personal”,
and, well, post-Leopard, I’m spending a lot less time poking around looking for
things.</p>

my pocket.  Since I’m shooting JPG and have a 2G card in there, it holds a
more or less infinite number of pictures, and I have to remind myself to
unload ’em every couple of weeks to see what’s there.  Often I’m
surprised.</p>
<img src="IMG_0645.jpg" alt="Sin" />
<p>I’m pretty sure the letters are part of a bigger word that isn’t there any
more, and it’s surprising that I can’t remember what it was, since I walk by
this window on average four times a day.</p>
<p>Tuesday was sunny, a rare day of relief.  The world is just going to have
to live with people from Vancouver bitching about the weather, because by my
count we’ve now been through five consecutive seasons without a really
sustained nice spell.   What

<title>Undergrad Geeks in Montréal</title>

<body>
<p>I’m talking about
<a href="http://2008.cusec.net/">CUSEC 2008</a>, that’s the Canadian
Undergraduate Software Engineering Conference.  What a blast.  If you’re a
student up here doing anything software-related, attend.  If you’re a veteran
and they ask you to speak, accept.  If you’re an employer looking for talent,
sponsor.  With some ultra-cute pics.</p>
<p>The culture was undergrad-chaos.  They come in by bus, they camp four to a
hotel room, they swill beer, they cheer wildly and laugh raucously at the
slightest provocation.  Gotta love it.</p>
<img src="IMGP7463.jpg" alt="The crowd at CUSEC 2008" />
<p>You know, the decades creep by on you, and you don’t even notice till you
realize everybody’s like <em>thirty years</em> younger than you are.  Still,
they laughed at my jokes.  Being around them made me feel cheery about my
profession.</p>
<img src="IMGP7468.jpg" alt="Undergrads at CUSEC" />
<img src="IMGP7469.jpg" alt="Undergrads at CUSEC" />
<p>For a semi-ad-hoc undergrad thing, this thing is pretty well-funded.
It’s not hard to understand why; everybody I know in the biz is hungry for
talent, and here are 350 kids, a high proportion of them about to graduate,
who care enough about what they’re doing to take the trouble to go to a
three-day conference including a Saturday.  Talk about self-selecting good
candidates.</p>
<p>The sponsors had little booths at which they explained what great places to
work they all are.  Here’s one.</p>

<title>On Web Service Definition</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There’s a flurry of discussion about whether or not, in the world of REST,
you need some sort of formal specification for the services you’re offering.
My conclusion: yes, but in a <em>very</em> application-specific way.</p>
<p>If you want to read up on the debate, check out
<a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/2008/01/18/Doctrine-of-Minimum-Necessary-Disclosure">Sam
Ruby</a> and
<a href="http://tomayko.com/weblog/2008/01/18/ws-vs-rest-sucks-nowadays">Ryan
Tomayko</a> (who’s hilarious while being insightful) and follow some pointers.
But the piece that made the penny drop for me was Dare Obasanjo’s
<a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2008/01/17/MythRESTfulWebServicesDontNeedAnInterfaceDefinitionLanguage.aspx">Myth: RESTful Web Services Don't Need an Interface Definition Language</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve always had this internal voice telling me that Web Services do really
need some sort of a way to declare them.  I can remember, years and years ago,
<a href="http://www.somebits.com/weblog/">Nelson Minar</a> saying “All I want
is a .h file for my Web Service” and thinking <em>yes</em>.</p>
<p>WSDL clearly isn’t the answer, but that’s because WSDL <em>sucks</em>,
deeply and totally.  I have had hopes for
<a href="https://wadl.dev.java.net/">WADL</a>, and still do.
But I have to say, it hasn’t been fully obvious to me how you’d actually
<em>use</em> such a beast.  So I had this little voice in the back of my head
muttering
“<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAGNI">YAGNI</a>”.</p>
<p>Then after reading Dare’s piece, it dawned on me that I just spent the last
three years of my life helping develop a Web Service Specification language,
namely the Atom Publishing Protocol’s
<a href="http://www.atomenabled.org/developers/protocol/atom-protocol-spec.php#appdocs">Service
Document</a>.  Plus, I’ve written a bunch of software that processes them.</p>
<p>But... the APP Service Doc is totally specific to the needs of one
particular RESTian protocol.  So, we have existence proof that there is at
least one useful instance of a service declaration.  We do not really have
existence proof that such a thing can be generalized across the needs of
multiple protocols or applications.</p>

<cat>The World/Places/Canada/Howe Sound</cat>
<title>Howe Sound Day</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We spent Sunday traveling with friends and visiting their cottage on
<a href="http://www.keats-island.ca/">Keats Island</a>, a smallish dot on 
the coastal British-Columbia map.  The body of water around it is called Howe
Sound, and if you’ve touristed around here you’ve seen it out of the left side
of your car on the first part of the way to Whistler, or the right side when
almost home.
Keats’ population in winter is maybe fifty; but
then a thousand on certain summer long weekends.  The Island and Sound are
photogenic.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>On Colour</h2>
<p>If you want to go north or west from Vancouver, you go by boat.  Often as a
customer of BC Ferries, a pleasant if spectacularly-inefficient 
public-sector operation.  Howe Sound’s waters were being kicked up by what
they call “the 
Squamish”, a wind blowing out of the inlet of that name.  This is over the
side of the ferry, there’s no stillness in that water.</p>
<img src="IMGP7490.jpg" alt="Wind and water from a BC ferry" />
<p>You will have noticed mountains in that picture.  That’s
true whichever way you look.  The next picture is looking back east at the
main coastal wall, the other side of which you see from Vancouver.</p>
<p>Along the bottom is the “Sea to Sky Highway”, the road between the city and
Whistler.  It’s got an awful reputation for traffic fatalities, curving as it
does along the edge.  Not surprising; people go up and ski like hell all
weekend, stay up late partying, have a beer with supper and then gun the BMW
around those curves; a little black ice and you’re a statistic.</p>
<p>Anyhow, they’re upgrading it for the 2010 Winter Olympics, which is a
heroic piece of engineering.  There are lots of mountainsides where they had
trouble squeezing in two lanes, and now they’re building four.  I’m
impressed.</p>
<img src="IMGP7494.jpg" alt="Backs of the mountains behind Vancouver" />
<p>It’s all blue and grey and green and white of course, but there are a whole
lot of different colours hiding behind those four words.  The next picture and
the last were taken from the same boat only two minutes apart.  It’s all about
which way the sun is pointing and where the clouds are.
At 49ºN latitude, the Sun takes a different course across the sky every month,
so the view is a living thing, rarely the same.</p>
<img src="IMGP7498.jpg" alt="Mountains around Howe Sound" />
<p>Here are two more, from the north shore of Keats Island, taken from the
same place, more or less, just pointing different directions.  The colour of
the water itself is pretty constant.</p>
<img src="IMGP7505.jpg" alt="Looking north from Keats Island" />
<img src="IMGP7511.jpg" alt="Looking north-east from Keats Island" />
<p>Those dark masses are trees of course; here’s what they look from the
inside.  Most of Keats’ forest burned a hundred years ago, but it still feels
pretty old inside.</p>
<img src="IMGP7543.jpg" alt="Forest on Keats Island" />
<h2 id='p-1'>On Cottages</h2>
<p>In the first paragraph I mentioned a “cottage”.  This notion is 
central to Canadian culture.  We’re a big country, thinly
populated, with lots of water.  So a remarkable proportion of the population
has a cottage by the water somewhere; most often a lake, but sometimes a river
and of course at the edges the ocean.</p>
<p>If you live away from a big city in the vast middle of the country, a
cottage on a lake that’s near enough to commute from in summer is within
the reach of perfectly ordinary people with perfectly ordinary jobs.
Yet Ontario and Québec urbanites are known to drive five hours to
visit the cottage.</p>
<p>The word applies comfortably to everything from a tumbledown shack to
a chateau.  For most people, normal standards of decor, housekeeping, and
dress are cheerfully discarded at the cottage.  Cooking is rough-and-ready
but, this being Canada, there’s always the chance of fresh fish or something
else really tasty on the barbecue.  Children are expected to run wild.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Winter Afternoon</h2>
<p>Eventually it was time to go home, which meant a stroll to the dock.</p>
<img src="IMGP7552.jpg" alt="The dock at Plumper Cove Marine Park, Keats Island " />
<p>The rest of these are just pictures from the ferry going home.  The
sunlight on the mountains turned them pink slowly while the moon floated over
them and the marine traffic ghosted past in the level rays.</p>
<img src="IMGP7572.jpg" alt="Winter dusk in Howe Sound" />
<img src="IMGP7573.jpg" alt="Winter dusk in Howe Sound" />
<img src="IMGP7587.jpg" alt="Winter dusk in Howe Sound" />
<img src="IMGP7598.jpg" alt="Winter dusk in Howe Sound" />
<p>We live within an hour of all this; it’s just nuts that we don’t spend more
time there.</p>

<title>Naked Terrorist Toothpaste</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>O’Hare airport, you know, I’ve said kind things about it here in the past,
but it’s developing an attitude problem.</p>
<p>I flew in from Ottawa earlier this week.  The plane was scheduled to leave
there at 5:40 PM and indeed there was a plane there at that time, waiting to
go.  We were
informed that Chicago had put a three-hour delay on all incoming flights due
to weather.  People around me were calling friends there who reported it
cold but clear.  The pilot, equally pissed, was hanging with the passengers and
said he thought they were repairing a runway, or maybe it was just the ATC
union being ornery.  This seems like bad behavior.</p>
<p>Then, leaving Chicago, Homeland Security seized my toothpaste.  The tube 
that was carefully purchased in a size that’s legal to take on planes.  Except
for, it wasn’t in a plastic bag.  You see, 90ml of naked toothpaste is
dangerous and can be used in terrorist attacks, but putting it in a plastic
bag prevents this.</p>
<p>Can we get some intelligent behavior out of our politicians please?  This
moronic security theater is damaging our quality-of-life and arguably playing
into the actual terrorists’ hands.</p>

<title>On Pentax</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>More news for the photo set.  Well, the proportion who care about
DSLRs, prime lenses, and so on.  OK, really only the
sub-sub-subculture that follows the products from 
<a href="http://www.pentaximaging.com/">Pentax</a>.  
With a few introductory remarks as to why you might be interested if you tend
to photogeekery.  Everyone else move right along.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>On Pentax</h2>
<p>Pentax’s market share lags far, far, behind the CaNikon duopoly.  They
were late to the DSLR market and have never had more than a couple of
models on sale.  They don’t have the most megapixels or frames/second or the
biggest telephotos.</p>
<p>Having said that, the Pentaxes, like every DSLR you can buy, take
great pictures.  And the company has a reputation for being a little eccentric
in their product strategies, verging on the frankly weird.</p>
<p>Plus, the cameras have outstanding ergonomics; probably a little ahead of
CaNikon.</p>
<p>Plus, and here we’re into <i>otaku</i> territory, the Pentax lens mount
hasn’t changed in fifty years or so.  Which means there’s this
astoundingly wide array of old and new lenses you can fool around with.</p>
<p>I’ve actually written three different <span class='o'>ongoing</span>
fragments about buying Pentax lenses: 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/04/27/Pentax-P-DA-40mm">Pentax smc P-DA 40mm
“Pancake”</a>, 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/05/24/Pentax-SMC-DA-21mm">New 21mm Lens</a>,
and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/11/15/Sigma-30mm-F1-4">Shinjuku
Cameras</a>.</p>
<p>By the way, all the photos in the recent
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2008/01/22/Howe-Sound">Howe Sound Day</a> were
shot with either the 40mm or 21mm prime.  There’s something really satisfying
about pointing a classic 21mm wide-angle at a bunch of mountains.</p>
<p>As for myself, my Dad and my wife were both into Pentax before I got
serious about cameras; so I had little choice in the matter.  But no
regrets, my camera makes me happy.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>New Stuff</h2>
<p>Back to our story.  Pentax just
<a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2008/01/pentax-updates.html">announced
some new cameras and lenses</a>.</p>
<p>They look pretty interesting... what made my little heart go pitter-pat
were the 100% crops of high-ISO shots with the K20D, the last four in the
<a href="http://www.popphoto.com/gallery.aspx?section_id=26&amp;section_prefix=cameras&amp;webtrends_section=cameras&amp;article_id=5049&amp;window_id=1&amp;gallery_id=1310&amp;page_number=2&amp;seq=1&amp;cnt=49&amp;slide=off">PopPhoto
Slideshow</a>.  More samples and sample-pointers
<a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2008/01/k20d-sample.html">chez
Mike Johnston</a>.
And by the way, when you’ve visiting <cite>The Online Photographer</cite>,
always read the comments for extra wit &amp; wisdom.</p>
<p>I suspect one of these is in my future.  The K200D is smaller and lighter
and that’s very important, but then I look at those high-ISO K20D crops and go
mmmmm... it’s only a <em>little</em> bigger.
On the other hand, having too many pixels these days is
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/12/22/Megapixel-Madness">grounds for
suspicion</a>; Has Moore’s law progressed far enough in four years that you
can squeeze 14.6MP into the space where my *ist-D has six, without paying a
price for overcrowding?</p>
<p>It’s striking that the K20D represents the
combination of Korean brute-force silicon wrangling (Samsung’s new CMOS
sensor) with Japanese design sensibilities and aesthetics.  Which is kind of a
new thing in the world.</p>
<p>You know, if you want to get into SLR photography and be a little
different, you might want to snap up a K100D or K10D (cheap!) while they’re
still available, or wait for the 200.  On the other hand, if you get the usual
Nikon or Canon just like everyone else, you’ll be perfectly happy too.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Online Culture</h2>

weird.  You’d think that a blog dedicated to a certain line of products would
be written by someone who, you know, <em>likes</em> those products.  But
RiceHigh does nothing but complain about how awful they are and how
everything’s wrong with them.  Odd.</p>
<p>Just recently I stumbled across
<a href="http://www.pdml.net/">PDML, the Pentax-Discuss Mailing List</a>, and
it’s a treat.  Maybe a little bit higher-volume than strictly necessary, but
erudite, witty, and frequently ribald.  With lotsa cool pix.  They call that
other guy “RiceWhine”.  I like it!  The Internet’s killer app remains, as
always, other people.</p>

<title>Dueling RIAs</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Today, at that
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2008/01/08/Avenue-A-Razorfish">Avenue A | Razorfish event</a> (A A|R is owned by Microsoft, it
turns out) there was a presentation from the people who built two different
sites for XM Radio.  The
<a href="http://xmradio.com/shop/index.xmc">Online Store</a> was built with
Flex, the <a href="http://xmradio.com/onxm/index.xmc">XM Program Guide</a>
with Ajax.
They both look pretty good.  I guess it 
means you can’t sign up for XM with an iPhone.  I remain unconvinced that the
extra sizzle and flash you get with RIA technology is enough better than Ajax
to make it worthwhile—but then XM reported increased conversion rates when
they rolled in the new site.  Interestingly, they said that Ajax was a
particularly good fit for the channel guide because HTML naturally handles
grid-like structures well.  True when you think of it, but I never had.</p>

<title>SSS: My Family</title>

<body>
<p>Over the past few years I’ve been slowly working through an inventory of
some thousands of 35mm slides taken by my Dad and others in the pre-digital
era.  I used to run a “Friday Slide Scan”.  It fell off a bit because I
neglected to scan for months at a time, and because the sequence I was working
through was all adorable babies and cute toddlers; of limited interest.
Well, it’s not Friday, and these are that kind of picture.  But still.</p>

<p>Both my mother and father are of course much younger than I am now.</p>
<p>Images in the Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1953
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>, 
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/08/11/MomsGarden">Jean Bray</a>, Tim Bray, Cath
Bray, and
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>; when I know
exactly who took one, I’ll say; in this case, Jean and Bill Bray, respectively.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using
a Nikon CoolScan 4000 ED scanner and cleaned up by a combination of the Nikon
scanning software, Photoshop Elements, and Adobe Lightroom.</p>

<title>WS-Enterprise, 2008</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I was talking to a very large financial-sector company in the middle of
America in the middle of last week, and the cognitive dissonance around this
whole WS-thing is palpable.</p>
<p>These particular guys, they’re a classic hybrid shop with a Java ranch and
a .NET plantation and everything needs to talk to everything, and now they
want “Web 2.0”, by which they mean interesting community apps built fast.
They’d just had their big Microsoft corporate visit, and the word, from Ray
Ozzie on down, is that it’s all WS-* all the time.</p>
<p>But they’re cautiously interested in modern Web tech like LAMP &amp; Rails,
where the support for that kind of stuff is
<a href="http://blog.labnotes.org/2008/01/28/ruby-in-practice-rest-soap-websphere-mq-and-salesforce/">mixed
at best</a>.</p>
<p>Then I come in and give them the REST message and take a few whacks at
particularly soft WS-targets (no shortage of those) and talk a little APP, and
everyone gets real uncomfortable.
I can tell you what we need; some packaging and labeling.  Something like the
Atom Publishing Protocol, it’s so easy to understand what it does and why you
might want to use it, there’s lots of comforting implementations, and when you
say “That’s REST at work”, well, heads nod.
REST needs a few APP analogues in other sectors, just to help make this stuff
easier to understand.</p>
<p>Damn, it’s been a long strange trip. You hear sad stories like
<a href="http://www.markbaker.ca/blog/2008/01/17/rest-vs-soap-the-personal-cost/">Mark
Baker’s</a>, and it makes me feel guilty; I’ve been calling the WS-emperor
naked almost as long as Mark, but from the comfort of a safe corporate
designated-radical
job, not really running any risks. We all owe Mark a vote of thanks and, hey:
he told you so. And after all that, it’s perfectly OK for
there to be
<a href="http://tomayko.com/weblog/2008/01/13/lying-through-their-teeth">anger</a>:
“it’s hard to understand how the same people who have screwed up so much of
the past near-decade should be given the space in reputable publications to
make these types of statements without them being attached to a letter of
resignation.”</p>
<p>And yeah, the guys in Redmond can chant their WS-mantras and we’ll even
build things like
<a href="https://wsit.dev.java.net/">WSIT</a> so Javaland can talk to them.
but, you know, the LAMP guys mostly won’t.
When the CTO of HP’s
<a href="http://h71028.www7.hp.com/enterprise/cache/483420-0-0-0-121.html?jumpid=go/bto">Business
Technology Optimization</a> group asks, in 
<a href="http://radovanjanecek.net/blog/archives/368.html">Is REST eclipsing SOAP?</a>,
“Are standards like ATOM or APP eclipsing SOAP? Yes, definitely. For very
simple reason—their adoption is way broader and tools support way better”,
it’s starting to look
like Redmond’s located on a WS-desert-island.</p>

<p>I’m talking about the
<a href="http://www.sun.com/products/sunmd/s20/index.jsp">Sun Modular
Datacenter S20</a>, now shipping (and, judging by what I hear on my field
trips, selling surprisingly well).  You’re wondering about “S20”?  Well, a
glance at some
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containerisation#Dimensions_and_payloads">container
facts</a> might lead you to expect an S40 or S45 in the future.  I don’t know,
the amount of compute power you can get in an S20 is already pretty
mind-boggling.
I note that the product page, appropriately postmodern, links to BlackBox
blogs, but unsurprisingly not to
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/17/In-A-Box">mine</a>, probably the most-read on the subject
due to the mini-scandal over my
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/22/Goodness-Gracious">egregiously bad
language</a> (and I have to say the comments on that one are
<em>excellent</em>).</p>
<p>But anyhow, now that this is a shipping product with a SKU and so on, I’d
like to reassure the technology buyers of the world that the S20 is
<em>no
longer totally drop-dead fucking cool</em>.  It’s just a well-designed and
real handy 
piece of infrastructure if you’ve got a data center in transition, or a remote
location, or a sudden growth spurt.  You can buy one without anyone suspecting
you of a dangerous tendency to coolness.</p>

<title>Feeling Sad</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’m feeling sad about the M/Y! deal. (Which I expect to sail
through—from the Yahoo! management/investor point of view, what’s not to like?)
You see, Yahoo! was the first actual real successful Internet business.
And Microsoft, well, they’re a bunch of things, but they’re not an Internet
company.</p>
<p>I was there at the beginning; my company had a brief partnership with Y!
back in 1995, when they were David and Jerry and seven others in a shitty
little strip-mall in Mountain View, with an ant problem; well, they
slept and ate pizza in their offices, what do you expect?  In a shabby machine-room next
door was quite a bit of netscape.com and playboy.com.</p>
<p>There was a golden moment there when if you wanted to do whatever on the
Internet, you’d go to whatever.yahoo.com and there it’d be.  Today, I use
<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com">Y! Finance</a> and that’s about it.</p>
<p>On Twitter and I’m sure by email and phone, the wolves are circling the
good Y! engineers.  Yowl.  Man, this is gonna be big and slow and ugly.</p>

<title>Little Dogs and Sophocles</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Let’s be honest: I love the Super Bowl.  We were at Kim and
Peter’s place with a bunch of other people and dogs, yukked it up and
stuffed ourselves, were happy.  And the football game in the background forced
itself into the foreground a couple of times, too.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Small Dogs</h2>
<p>Peter and Kim have a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papillon_%28dog%29">Papillon</a> and
Diane has two
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pug">Pugs</a>, so the scene featured
small hurtling dogs, and our toddler-girl in among the chaos.
She won a tug-of-war with the Papillon (twenty-plus pounds to seven, but the
dog is way more co-ordinated) to the accompaniment of wild applause.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Food</h2>
<p>To eat, there were crackers and crab dip and blue-cheese dip and cheddar and
baguettes and chicken-chili-on-a-bun and stuffed jalapeños and buffalo
thighs (like wings) and Lauren’s banana/chocolate-chip coffeecake.</p>
<p>There was some spillage, but the dogs took care of that.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Music</h2>
<p>Look, I like Tom Petty.  But that was pretty lame.  I say give Prince a
five-year contract for the Super Bowl gig, with full creative control, and see
what he makes of it.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Football</h2>
<p>I toured the blogs and thought the deepest remark was “The
Giants’ defense limited Tom Brady to <em>one</em> touchdown pass.”
And that fourth-quarter Manning-to-Tyee scramble is gonna be on best-of
reels for decades.  I counted at least eleven hands grabbing the back of Eli’s
jersey, and the time between him getting loose and throwing that astounding
pass had to be under a second.</p>
<p>The game tasted like one of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophocles">Sophocles’</a> better
tragedies; divine gifts made too much of, then hubris brought low.
That’s coming it a bit high... but a few of those football plays managed to
wrench the audience’s attention away from good company and doggie antics and
really outstanding food.  Which is all Sophocles ever asked of <em>his</em>
plays, I bet.</p>

<p>This week we visited a Saskatchewan farm where they have a few
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_cattle">Highland cattle</a>,
which are just adorable.</p>
<p>Here’s a group shot:</p>
<img src="IMGP7653.jpg" alt="Highland cattle in Saskatchewan winter" />
<p>They don’t seem to mind the Prairie winter, even when it gets down to
-30ºC; look at that fur.
They’re approachable and mild-mannered; seem to enjoy being scratched like a dog.</p>
<p>Here are a mother-and-child.  There will be three more calves in that
particular pasture by April; should be great fun.</p>
<img src="IMGP7657.jpg" alt="Highland cow and calf in Saskatchewan winter" />
<p>This farm has a great big dog named Missy, not all that bright, who has a
complicated relationship with the cattle.  She chases the calf around and I’m
<em>almost</em> sure it’s a game, because once or twice up and down the
paddock and the calf breaks off and heads back to her mother.
And later, at morning haytime, Missy got a little
too close and one of them just shook her horns at her and she jumped back like
a scared kitten.</p>

directions; for Ted, they were the milk of paradise, and started him building
a system named Xanadu. He’d invented the word “hypertext” (which is what both
h’s stand for in <code>http://www.god.com/love.html</code> and similar billboard fodder
everywhere), and Xanadu was going to be the universal hypertext that would
contain everything worth caring about.  A lot of people spent a lot of time
and a lot of other people’s money and to make a really long story short,
Xanadu never shipped.  But it’s still a
<a href="http://www.xanadu.net/">live project</a>, Ted claims.</p>
<p>Whether or not Xanadu ever could have worked, or has a future, isn’t that interesting.  Xanadu was one of the great what-if questions, and today’s World Wide Web is the best answer so far, which gives Ted his place in history.</p>
<p>He is for now in Japan, at a good university near Kamakura, where the great
Buddha welcomes all comers.  He’s had some tough years and he’s tired, but
still strong, and still asking what-if questions.  Mind you, not all of them
are going to have answers as big as the Web.  He’s a wonderful orator and I’d
go out of my way any time to hear him hold forth on pretty well anything.
Many people think Ted is wrong about any number of important technical issues,
but asking the right questions is way more important than getting the right
answers.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>TimBL</h2>
<p>Tim Berners-Lee is sometimes abbreviated TimBL, which rhymes with “thimble”.  We have to call him TimBL because there’s another Tim in this story, namely me. TimBL’s a computer programmer by trade.  He used to be a staff geek at CERN, the big physics factory in Switzerland, where hundreds of physicists from everywhere work in tribal shifts, spending tens of millions in hard-won research grants pursuing the neutrino’s mass (if any) and the Higgs boson’s existence (or not).  These people produce information, lots of it and all the time; they need to share it around, but the printed scientific journals that used to serve this purpose are just impossibly slow and don’t help much.</p>
<p>By the time TimBL went to work at CERN, the Internet had been running for a
few years, serving only big computers and the first wave of emailers.  The
CERN computer group wanted collaboration over the Net, and thought that
hypertext, Ted’s invention, might be the way.  So TimBL built a hypertext that
worked across the Internet.  Lots of computer scientists had been chiseling
away at the problem for years, but TimBL ignored the entire body of theory and
pasted together the simplest possible version with one-way pointers carrying no guarantees of what (if anything) they pointed at.  No computer scientist could have conceived of anything so tenuous and fragile.</p>
<p>That turned out to be the World Wide Web, and TimBL is now famous.  In mid-1998, the McArthur foundation recognized him as an official genius and wrote him a high-six-figures cheque, which is nice because a lot of other people who didn’t invent the Web have made a lot of money there.</p>
<p>TimBL is thin, pale, and twitchy, a well-bred British baby-boomer who
circumlocutes and temporizes and gets to the point slowly.  Englishly, he
deplores confrontation and can find a way to paint any blood-feud in the
colours of unfortunate misunderstanding.  His publications suggest strong
idealism, an overriding vision of the future of information space.  His
detractors say he’s a good second-rate programmer who was at the right place
at the right time and got lucky.  The McArthur foundation says he’s a genius.
I can’t figure out what he’s getting at half the time, or why he does things,
but I’ve known a couple of real geniuses and that’s not necessarily a
symptom. As with most people in this story,
<a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee ">you can read</a> what he has to say about himself.</p>
<p>TimBL currently serves as Director of an organization called the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (everyone says W3C), which is the Web family’s marriage counselor.  By ’94, a lot of people had realized that there was some serious money to be made on the Internet, and a lot of little startups were entering the corporate toddler phase.  The big parental figures like Microsoft and MCI and Sun had learned that none of them could (quite) corral the Internet for themselves, and it was obvious that their failure to get along might send the whole industry down the crapper.</p>
<p>So they built the W3C, and put a bunch of academics and dreamers and social liberals in charge of it. “For the children’s sake” so to speak. Which is not exactly in line with the ethos of late-modern capitalism, but it must have seemed like a good idea at the time.</p>
<p>If a bunch of businesses get together to agree on shared infrastructure, that arguably contravenes all sorts of antitrust laws.  To get around this, the W3C is structured as a dictatorship, with TimBL having the last word on everything (the charter is reminiscent of Iran’s constitution), so that all the decisions and policies and standards are nominally the work of one person.  And there’s no point in litigating against one person (even after the McArthur grant) for antitrust violations. </p>
<p>TimBL will certainly be remembered as the chief inventor of HTML (hypertext
markup language) and HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) which together are the
glue that allows all the world’s computers to paste pretty web pages on the
inside of your computer screen. TimBL now lives in Boston.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Ted and TimBL</h2>
<p>Back when he was still trying to convince a skeptical public that the Web was useful, TimBL’s path crossed Ted’s at a conference; hypertext’s past meeting its future. Ted dismissed TimBL’s work as a toy, which was more or less true; but when when a toy’s range is the breadth and depth of the Internet, you have to remember that TV and the railways were also once toys.</p>
<p>It turns out that Bill Gates was also at that conference, and both Ted and
TimBL were more interested in impressing him than each other.  Both struck
out.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Charles</h2>
<p>Charles F. Goldfarb is a Jew from New York who got a Harvard law degree and went to work for IBM.  How much more conventional can you get? This was in the sixties, and IBM hired him to help them sell their stuff to, and install it at, lawyers’ offices.  Lawyers deal mostly in text, and at that time processing text with computers was mostly unexplored territory.</p>
<p>Charles and a couple of colleagues eventually invented something they called GML, which allegedly stood for Generalized Markup Language, but then Goldfarb’s two colleagues had last names beginning with M and L.  GML turned out to be really useful in big-time text processing applications, and after some years’ evolution became an official “ISO Standard”, under the name SGML, for Standard Generalized Markup Language.  Becoming such a standard is no mean feat.  ISO, headquartered in Switzerland, is conservative, bureaucratic, and slow; irritating but arguably beneficial in an organization that exists to write rules for the world’s infrastructure.</p>
<p>Charles, fiftyish now, is dark, burly, balding, bearded, Californian. He
wears Western-style string ties, talks energetically with a lot of hand
movement and still a New York rasp.  He’s been out of IBM and
<a href="http://www.sgmlsource.com/">on the Web</a> now for a few years, but remains synonymous with SGML. He has been known to say that developing standards is a war of attrition; the last person left sitting with unglazed eyes around the conference table often gets things their way.  Charles has one of the world’s true iron butts; an argument with him is like trying to defend a sandcastle from an incoming tide.  Furthermore, he’s often right.</p>
<p>This article isn’t really about technology, but I need to explain that SGML, despite the acronym, is not a language but a “meta-language” – you use it to build your own computer languages for your own purposes.  Which is a very good idea, because the purposes of people are multifarious indeed, a custom language is often a good solution to a thorny problem.  One of the most famous languages built this way is HTML – the one that TimBL invented for his working answer to Ted’s original question.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Yuri</h2>
<p>Yuri Rubinsky died in early 1996 (suddenly, of a heart attack)
before our story really got started, and his death affected a lot of people,
including me; I excerpt here from my contribution to his
<a href="http://xml.coverpages.org//yuriMemColl.html">collective online
obituary</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't understand how a person can found a software company, tough it out through the bad days, lead it through the vale of Internet Fairy Dust, turn a silly idea into a PC Mag Editor’s Choice, simultaneously be a pusher, mover, and shaker in the WWW and SGML worlds, get a novel published, wrestle with ISO, and never, so far as I know, cut a throat, stab a back, or crush an ego.  That it is possible to be successful and honourable at the same time is something we should take seriously to heart; in these days it seems too little respected, or even expected.</p>
<p>That alone would be a monument; maybe the only important one. But there are
lots of others; a substantial part of the community, the technology, and the
business. </p>
<p>[Recently …] he and I walked about 40 blocks home across San Fran …, late
at night, talking excitedly about some stuff we want to do on the Web, that
might yet turn into another monument.  You know those hills, neither of us
were exactly slim nor fit, and we laughed at our own heavy breathing as we
slogged up, over and down.  Tough to think that we won't be doing that
again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yuri, a Canadian of Russian descent; was born in Beirut, Lebanon (a place we’ll hear from again) and, and while his family was Gentile as far as he knew, looked like a caricature of a mid-European Jewish intellectual.  He came out of the typesetting business, built a new company and led it into the SGML business. He got Charles’ big book published and wrote its foreword.</p>
<p>Yuri was one of the first to see that TimBL was onto something, becoming an
early Web evangelist, getting his company to ship one of the first useful Web
authoring tools.  Yuri believed passionately that while TimBL’s HTML was a
cool application, the Web really needed something like SGML if it was going to
grow up.  But then he died.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Jon</h2>
<p>Jon Bosak is a writer who escaped into high tech from the inspiring but stingy publishing world; not the first by any means. Almost any product has to come with instructions on how to make it go, and complicated products like airplanes and Internet switches and cars have to come with complicated maintenance manuals.  This charmless necessary stuff is charmlessly called “techdoc”.  Jon is a techdoc guy, one of the best.</p>
<p>He used to work for Novell, the Utah-based networking company.  He did very well there, saving them tons of money and building one of the first really good and useful Web sites, where all the Novell customers could look up the latest and greatest techdoc without having to shuffle paper.  This work was all based on SGML, Charles’ invention; Jon’s use of it to drive a Web site worked beautifully and should have been a signpost for the industry.</p>
<p>Jon, another boomer, is shortish, and looks like the child that might have been born to John Lennon and a Kennedy.  His attire is resolutely and consistently brown and tweedy; he wears wire rims, and struggles constantly under the weight of loads of computer technology.  We all carry computers now; Jon, however, has the biggest, heaviest laptop money can buy, and travels, just to be sure, also with a speakerphone and small printer.  In his brown clothes, with bulging satchels, he looks like Kenneth Grahame’s Mr. Rat off to a picnic.</p>
<p>Jon is a highly effective platform speaker; he has mastered the unusual but good rhetorical technique of driving home a key point by lowering his voice, speaking more slowly, and closing his eyes.</p>
<p>Jon went from Novell to work for Sun Microsystems, a big, sexy, Silicon Valley computer company; he lives in Los Altos in the heart of the Valley.  Jon and Yuri went way back, sharing the view that the Web needed SGML; but the Web was being built in suburban California warehouses by kids in shorts and T-shirts, who  saw SGML as a big, corporate, blue-suit kind of thing. Nonetheless, Jon decided that TimBL’s W3C should make SGML happen on the Web.  The W3C didn’t see it that way and ignored him; since he wouldn’t shut up and go away, they told him sure, he could launch an “SGML on the Web” activity if he did all the work, but to shut up and go away while he did it.</p>
<p>We’ll jump a little bit ahead in the story here; Jon’s SGML-on-the-Web
eventually became known as “Extensible Markup Language” (XML for short) and is
now a certifiably Big Deal on the Internet.  So from here on in, we’ll just
say “XML” and save space; but we’re really talking about Standard Generalized
Markup Language on the World Wide Web.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>James </h2>
<p>James Clark is a computer programmer.  People in the trade will tell you that a good programmer isn’t twice as good as an average one, but many times as good.  There’s no meter to measure such things, but I’ve worked for, and with, and managed, a lot of them, and my experience is that the performance of working programmers varies by a factor of at least 100.  James is at 100.</p>
<p>His ancestors made enough money that he, a GenXer, doesn’t really have to
work.  He is our story’s second Englishman, but is less polished and much more
direct than TimBL.  He has not let the fact that he is a deity in our
technical community go to his head, is good company for dinner or a beer, and
unpretentious
<a href="http://www.jclark.com/">on the Web</a>. James is thin, darkish, open-faced, doesn’t stand out in a crowd; is erudite on wine, fine cooking, and text processing.</p>
<p>What James cares about is typography, and in particular how to arrange for
computers to do it better than they do now.  What he does about it is write
fine software and give it away for free.  James decided the world needed good
SGML software.  Unfortunately, SGML, as defined by Charles and his committee,
was insanely complex and studded with options, many of which interacted in
surprising and hard-to-understand ways.  Thus, SGML software was scarce,
expensive, and often flaky.  James wrote a program called SP (for SGML Parser
– one could imagine something sexier) that is so good that it has become the <i>de facto</i> definition of what is SGML and what isn’t.  Naturally, he gives it away for free. </p>
<p>He lives in Bangkok because he likes Thai food and the language.  He may have friends or family who are not Internet, programming, or typography geeks, but I’ve never met any.  He works on problems that interest him. A German software company which once tried to buy some consulting from James (they subsequently retained me, which is how I know) were gently discouraged, with the explanation that he was quite expensive and really only interested in challenging problems. How expensive, they asked.  If he were to come visit them and advise them on their problems, he would require a donation be made, in the amount of £10,000, to a Thai charity of James’ choice. </p>
<h2 id='p-8'>Jon and James</h2>
<p>When Jon was launching the XML project, he took advantage of the W3C’s obliviousness to load the committee with people that he thought good, without regard to their corporate positioning. The first was James; since his name is one to conjure with, Jon persuaded him to accept the title of “Technical Lead”.   He deserves his place in this story if only for having invented the acronym XML – if we assert that X stands for Extensible, then it does.</p>
<p>The XML project has run mostly by teleconference and email.  James is not pushy on the phone, and his soft South England vowels don’t cut through the echo-y, static-y line from Bangkok very well, so we have to listen hard to hear what he says.  Which we do.</p>
<h2 id='p-9'>Tim</h2>
<p>This is me, a fortysomething Canadian raised mostly in Beirut (there it is again).  I’m profoundly bookish and discovered early that writing is always difficult, sometimes boring, and usually poorly paid, while computer programming is mostly easy, only rarely boring, and remarkably lucrative.  I’m a good programmer (somewhere in the middle of that scale where James scores 100), a competent writer, and (for my profession, where standards are low) an unusually good orator.  This, despite my general disorganization, laziness, and lousy management skills, has been enough to get me through. </p>
<p>I’m average size, average weight, fair, largely bald, with a vaguely Mennonite look caused by wearing a beard <i>sans</i> mustache, and speak average toneless mid-North-American.</p>
<p>Before XML, the most fun I’d had at work was helping with the computerization of the Oxford English Dictionary.  The OED, in its computerized form, was stored in almost-but-not-quite SGML, and I was a fan of the basic ideas starting about 1987.</p>
<p>A couple of colleagues and I started a company based on that technology,
which proved only marginally interesting to the real world; we limped along
for years until the Web came along and suddenly everybody wanted one. I built
one of the first big Web search engines and we did an IPO and I got sick of
corporate life and went 
<a href="http://www.textuality.com">independent</a>. I live in Vancouver, Canada.</p>
<h2 id='p-10'>Jon and Tim</h2>
<p>In May 1996, I delivered the closing speech at an SGML conference in Munich, exhorting SGML to simplify itself and get with the Web.  Jon wandered up just afterward and asked me to join his XML project.  I said no.  A couple of weeks later I realized what a good idea he had, and called back to say yes.  Jon said no; but then he changed his mind too.  </p>
<p>Jon and I see eye to eye on most points, and appreciate each other’s obsessions.  Also I think we work well together on a stage; Jon smaller, browner, still, focused; I larger, pinker, louder, animated.</p>
<h2 id='p-11'>Eve</h2>
<p>Eve Maler, a Honolulu-born boomer now in suburban New England, toiled for years, like Jon, in the techdoc mines.  I mentioned earlier that SGML (and XML) are used for inventing your own computer languages. Languages aren’t easy – birthing a new one is on the same order of difficulty as a screenplay, or a family of typefaces, or a housing development.  Eve is perhaps the world’s leading expert on the practice of how you go about doing this; the book she co-wrote on the subject is probably the best reference. </p>
<p>Eve is buxom, curly-haired, full of smiles.  Some people foolishly conclude that she is a technical lightweight and usually end up exposing their foolishness in public. In particular, Eve’s years in techdoc have made her a virtuoso among editors; no mistake, no matter how small, escapes her probing eye.</p>
<h2 id='p-12'>Michael</h2>
<p>C. Michael Sperberg-McQueen has a name that is unusually long by any
standard and was, during our many months of teleconferences, mangled every
time by the operator. He
knows a great deal about the use of computers to get complicated things printed, and is a language designer of some repute.
Michael is erudite on a frightening variety of subjects, speaks perfect
German, is a polished writer and a competent computer programmer.  He became
famous in the SGML community first as a gifted and stirring speaker – the
perennial closing-keynote at our big conferences – and as a leader of the
<a href="http://www.tei-c.org/">Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)</a>.  The TEI is the result of years of collaborative work by many of the world’s best humanities-computing academics.  It is a family of SGML-based languages which are used to store an amazing variety of electronic scholarly texts including Chaucer, Strindberg, the correspondence of Proust, Serbian Proverbs, Voltaire, and Japanese Map Task Dialogues.
Michael, about 8 feet tall, correspondingly broad-shouldered, and with a bit of middle-aged spread, would be an intimidating presence were he not so professorial. He is at all times in strict conformance with the dress code of the Midwestern academic: tweeds, checks, scarf, cloth cap. </p>
<h2 id='p-13'>The Honeymoon</h2>
<p>I guess at some point I have to mix some events into this story. Jon formed the committee, which started work in August 1996.  Michael and I were appointed co-editors of XML. We worked out the technology in telephone conferences and group email.   On the committee were some other people that don’t get their own write-ups here; this is totally unfair, because they did as much of the work as the people you are meeting.  But since I’m the writer, I get to pick the cast of characters, based on how much fun they are to write about.</p>
<p>In one sentence: XML is a meta-language built by taking SGML, throwing out most of the little-used advanced features, building in good foreign-character support, and a few other technical tweaks not worth expounding on here.  The world seems to like it.</p>
<p>Our first draft specification came out in November 1996. Its construction was a wonderful experience.  Jon had stacked the committee with people who knew meta-languages, who understood the Web, and who knew what worked and what didn’t. Jon did not invite Charles on board, and whereas Charles has never said a word about this, it is reasonable to suppose that he is hurt to this day.  We all knew each other, used the same vocabulary, and wanted more or less the same thing. We had technical differences, passionate at times; but the progress was fast and steady.</p>
<h2 id='p-14'>Charles and Michael and Tim </h2>
<p>We on the committee were working hard, designing XML at top speed and having fun doing it.  Eventually, we reached the vexatious question of whether we had to be 100% compatible with SGML; Michael and I had some ideas for changes that felt like real improvements. Charles got wind of this and went nuts. To introduce our changes would have been to betray our heritage, to split the industry, to throw away a decade’s gains, to spit, it seemed in the face of all that was good and sacred.  So he launched a war of attrition, his chief tactic being to telephone the members of the committee, one by one, and fill the phone line with heated (and in some part reasonable) arguments against our apostasy.  He was not unreasonable, he was not sleazy, and he was not unfriendly.  He was also not willing to get off the phone until you’d conceded his point.  Since he had a habit of calling up after 8 PM, this could get seriously trying.</p>
<p>Charles’ butt proved more ironic than those of a substantial number of committee members, his incoming tide washed away the opposing arguments.   Enough, eventually, that the committee was split on the issue, more or less evenly, and most of the new ideas died unborn (in retrospect, this was not entirely a bad thing).  It still seems unreasonable to me that one person can by sheer endurance beat down a committee of 11, who are on average 10 years or more younger, but there you go.</p>
<h2 id='p-15'>Lauren</h2>
<p>Lauren Wood is a New Zealander whose adult life has been in Australia and
Germany.  She has a Ph.D. in theoretical nuclear physics and speaks fluent German, but discovered the same work-pay relationship between physics and programming that I discovered between writing and programming.  She has now been toiling in the publishing software mines for years. </p>
<p>Lauren is smallish, slenderish, dark-haired, pale-skinned, large-eyed, and speaks with an Auckland lilt that can veer into complete opacity on words with a strong “O”, such as “word” and “cold”.  She is cheerful, patient, and very good company.</p>
<h2 id='p-16'>Tim and Lauren and Yuri</h2>
<p>I met Lauren at a conference in Montreux; she was working for a German company that sold, among other things, my company’s software.  Then I met her again at a conference in Singapore, and she visited me in Vancouver.
Pretty soon I was trying to convince her to stay in Vancouver, but there was the little matter of a job and citizenship and so on.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I ran into Yuri at an airport.  In the near-empty pallid grey of the baggage-claim, he twisted my arm to help him write a book about SGML on the Web. I twisted his arm to help get Lauren a job in Vancouver (where he had a programming shop). Since I was short of time, he failed to get my help with the book.  Since our industry is short of talent, the job was no problem.  Canadian immigration issues melted away like the infrequent Vancouver snow in the face of a native English speaker with a Ph.D., a marketable skill, and a company begging to hire her.</p>
<p>In her new job, Lauren quickly got involved in the XML project.  We were
married in November 1996, just after XML was unleashed on the world.</p>
<h2 id='p-17'>Jean</h2>
<p>Jean Paoli is a citizen of France but really Lebanese, a typical Levantine ethnic cocktail: dark, burly, hirsute, chubby-faced.  Jean, like I, left Beirut for more favorable climes when the people of Lebanon, funded and encouraged their neighbors and by the great powers, took up civil war as a pastime. He was the main brain at a little French software company that sucked at the teat of the European Union and other continental bureaucracies, and had a nice line of SGML products very early on.</p>
<p>Jean was closely involved with the European research establishment, and clued into the Web just about on day one.  His was a famous face in the SGML world, and everyone noticed when, one day, he packed his bags and moved from Paris to Redmond to work for Microsoft.</p>
<p>Jean was a charter member of Jon’s XML project; the idea that Microsoft would actually pay attention to our dream was more than a little intoxicating.  Jean, a leading co-conspirator during XML’s honeymoon, soon leaves the story, for reasons we’ll get into later.</p>
<h2 id='p-18'>Phil </h2>
<p>Phil Karlton died in 1997 (in an Italian auto accident while on vacation), so only takes a brief turn on this stage. Way into the top half of that 1-to-100 programming proficiency scale, he had a good academic career, then worked at the revered Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.  Xerox PARC was where they invented icons and pointers and windows and workstations; but management was too dumb to ever make serious money from these things.</p>
<p>Phil went to work for Netscape, the startup darling of the Internet, not in its first days, but around the time it achieved critical mass. His job there was to provide general technical leadership; he was old enough that his son was also on the Netscape programming staff.</p>
<p>Phil was an ugly bald whiskery sweet man, with lots of rough edges and an
apparently-perfect 20-year marriage that, I think, intimidated many whose
relationships are more mundane and compromise-laden. He drove an NSX and
played ball-hockey and lived intensely; all this is
<a href="http://karlton.hamilton.com/">well-documented</a>.</p>
<h2 id='p-19'>Lauren and Tim and Phil </h2>
<p>Phil, his wife Jan, Lauren and I are meeting for dinner at a nice Italian
restaurant on El Camino in the Valley.  Since we have a positive personal
buzz, the deal is that this is a social engagement, not a technology debate
nor a plot-hatching session. The hostess leads us to a small table beside a
large, boisterous party.  Phil asks her who the people are (you need to be careful in the Valley).   From Microsoft, she says, and Phil, in his booming rasp, answers without a pause “Microsoft?  I won’t sit beside them – let’s go over there.”</p>
<p>Over dinner, despite our best efforts, conversation veers again and again into matters of Internet politics and markup languages and software technology.  Phil lets this happen, but every time a new acronym or piece of jargon or person’s name flies across the table, he stops, turns to Jan (who is an artist – not geeky at all), and explains in clear layman’s terms what or where or who it is.  Such consideration is not common; even at second hand, it is moving.</p>
<h2 id='p-20'>Ned and Mick</h2>
<p>Some of the people in this story are companies. Ned is Netscape and Mick is Microsoft.  Yes, any company, <i>au fond</i>, is just a collection of people.  But some companies, at some times, are more than that, and their representatives are both less and more than people.  Less, because they perforce speak with a voice not their own, and more, because that voice is the voice of hundreds or thousands (of colleagues), and of millions or billions (of dollars).  </p>
<p>For example, while Jean was just Jean at the beginning of the process, once Microsoft got really interested he stopped being Jean and starting speaking with Mick’s voice. It’s hard to argue with a company, because they make their decision off stage, and their role in a dialogue is then to win their point, not to strive for truth.  And as XML became increasingly successful, Jean’s role on our committee was filled by a succession of other Microsoft staffers, whose individual personalities matter little.</p>
<p>Mick is a domineering, ruthless, greedy, egotistical, self-centered, paranoid bastard.  Whether or not he’s actually a crook is, as they say, currently the subject of litigation; but he’s not good company or a good friend.   The ruthlessness and greed would not be so irritating (we swim, after all, in late-capitalist waters) were they not accompanied, at all
times, by Mick’s claim to speak not in his own interest, but selflessly on behalf of his millions of customers, whose needs only he understands.  Thus, anyone who disagrees is conspiring against the interests of the world’s computer users. </p>
<p>Mick’s other really irritating habit is constant grating prating about “great” products and “innovation”. Certain Microsoft executives are going to spend eternity fleeing around the <i>bolgias</i> of Hell from demons wielding branding irons on which “great software” and “innovation” glow white-hot. A very large majority in the computing trades think the products are mostly pretty poor, and see the company as the single greatest roadblock to innovation in our profession.</p>
<p>Netscape a.k.a. Ned was definitely the new kid on the block.   His parents were an academic staff geek who added pictures to the Web, and a money manager who’d launched a couple of high tech high flyers.  Ned came from nowhere at just the right time and suddenly Owned The Internet, in large part because Mick hadn’t noticed it; if Bill had paid more attention to Ted and TimBL at that long-past conference, the world would be different.</p>
<p>Coming from nowhere and Owning The Internet turn out to be bad influences in the young life of a company.  Ned was like a rookie pitcher who burns ‘em up in his first 20 games with a wicked screwball, but won’t listen to the pitching coach who tells him to mix them up, nor to the trainer who tells him he’ll burn out his arm, nor to the manager who tells him the hitters will eventually figure that screwball out.</p>
<p>While Mick got with the XML program, Ned steadfastly ignored it.  Jon’s XML gang disliked this, so all of us pounded on Ned’s door, besieged him with email, called everyone we knew with a line in, trying to send the message that this was important, and that Mick was getting into it big time.  Ned didn’t have time for us, because Ned Owned the Internet and don’t you forget it.</p>
<h2 id='p-21'>Lauren and Phil</h2>
<p>Lauren had met Phil in connection with another W3C activity, and they had hit it off.  She was known to be one of the SGML bigots who were playing this XML game, and yet she seemed young, Web-oriented, pragmatic; not one of the crusty ISOfied bureaucrats.</p>
<p>So Lauren got a call one day, and took a quick trip from Vancouver to Silicon Valley.   It’s the same time zone, you can get up in Vancouver and make a 10:30 meeting down there, which is fine because technical meetings in the Valley are never before noon. She spent the day closeted with Phil and a bunch of other senior Netscape hacks, and, it seems, made the sale.  Ned was now officially an XML fan.</p>
<h2 id='p-22'>Ned and Tim</h2>
<p>Trouble was, Ned still Owned The Internet, except for Mick was pouring hundreds of millions into Internet R&amp;D so he could give software away, drive Ned into out of the business, and Own The Internet himself. Thus Ned was preoccupied, and didn’t really have anybody on staff who understood XML issues.</p>
<p>The solution was pretty obvious to me. I was independent, remember, and I’d been doing all this XML work <i>pro bono</i>, first of all because it was a good thing to do, and because I thought I’d have some spare time while my business picked up.  It turned out to be hot stuff, and very time-consuming, and I didn’t want to let go, but I did want to get paid.</p>
<p>So I gave Ned the big pitch – offering myself as their eyes and ears; they’d get to find out what was going on, they’d visibly be no longer ignoring XML, and I’d make some money.  They bought that pitch, which was certainly a good deal for me; basically I was getting paid for what I’d been doing anyhow; all I had to do was to write them a weekly email report, and pay regular visits to brief their engineers.</p>
<p>Except for those regular visits never happened; their engineers were too busy Owning The Internet to pay attention to outside ideas.</p>
<h2 id='p-23'>Eve and TimBL</h2>
<p>It’s early 1997; at a nice restaurant in Santa Clara, a few of us gather for dinner with TimBL.  This is the first time he has actually spoken with the XML gang, and the first time some of them have met him.  I am sitting next to Eve, across the table from TimBL.</p>
<p>TimBL starts to expound another of his brilliant ideas, which while technically not half bad, exhibits profound ignorance of a decade of history.  Imagine a young priest sitting down with a conclave of cardinals and explaining that the Catholic message would be so much more coherent if they dropped all that rococo blessed-virgin-Mary-mother-of-God stuff.  After a certain amount of this, Eve is literally shaking with fury, the volume is up, and the waiters are watching our table nervously.  </p>
<p>On the way back to our hotel, Lauren, looking puzzled, asks me a reasonable question: “were you flirting with Eve?”  And I am forced to admit that I had put my hand on her thigh more than once.  But these were cautionary cool-it-buddy pats; I’d had this vision of Eve hurtling across the table to get a stranglehold on TimBL, and I’d bet on Eve in that fistfight any day.  It would have been seriously bad publicity for XML if one of our committee members were publicly to inflict violence on the Inventor Of The Web.</p>
<h2 id='p-24'>Mick and TimBL and Tim</h2>
<p>First thing I did in co-operation with Ned was publish 
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/mcf/NOTE-MCF-XML.html">a paper</a> that got a lot of attention around the W3C and sent some smiles Ned’s way.  Mick went ballistic; this was the period before the Department of Justice had really started nosing around, when <i>Netscape delenda est</i> was the tune of the day in Redmond, and no blow was too low.</p>
<p>So Jean called me up and wondered if I would drop Ned and start working with Mick; the details didn’t really matter, but the price would be good.  I declined, since I was having too much fun, and as I told Jean, Ned really needed the help.  “Tim,” said Jean, “<i>personne n’est irremplaceable</i>,” but his voice was sad, because I wasn’t buying it.</p>
<p>So Mick called up TimBL and said “one of the XML co-editors has been
co-opted by the evil Ned, and we can’t have that”.  I was ordered to resign as
co-editor, and Jon was ordered not to reappoint me without unanimous consent, which Mick would of course withhold.</p>
<p>I refused to go gentle into that good night; in fact, I sustained a childish tantrum for some weeks, scurrying around soliciting support from other committee members and  publishing an intemperate Philippic.  Mick’s idea was that my defenestration should be accomplished quietly and with the minimum of fuss.  Thus my shrill public squealing was acutely embarrassing for all concerned, and gave the Mick-haters (there are lots) opportunities for gleeful if not entirely sincere Expressions Of Grave Concern At This Questionable Process.</p>
<p>In all this nastiness, Jon distinguished himself by (outward) reasonable
calm, and by refusing to do anything on grounds of expedience, requiring
rather a basis in principle for each action.  Three weeks after my execution,
I was exhumed and revivified; you’ll still see my name on the front of the XML
specification.  It probably helped that it would have been difficult at that
time to find someone else with the spare cycles and expertise.
As part of the deal, Jean was named the third XML co-editor,
which was a good idea anyhow.</p>
<h2 id='p-25'>Nov. 14, 1996</h2>
<p>XML was officially unleashed on the world on Nov. 14, 1996 at the annual SGML conference, which draws a thousand or two to the frozen Northeast. Nine members of the XML committee sat in a semicircle on the stage. Jon and Michael and James and I spoke to a packed and electric room. James, who has a tendency to mumbling and jargon, was dynamic, even cracked a joke.  Charles was not in the audience.  The SGML community, smelling Internet money and the mainstream, took about 15 seconds to buy in.  </p>
<p>Jon and I turned our attention to selling it to the rest of the world.  We besieged technical journalists, scrambled for speaking spots at every significant industry conference.  We thought we’d face a brick wall of resistance and indifference and were determined to batter through it.</p>
<p>It melted. It turned out that Jon and Yuri had been right all along; the Web apparently needed more or less exactly what we’d been building.  You can read about it now in newsstand magazines – <cite>TIME</cite> and <cite>The Economist</cite>, forsooth – and a few of us, Jon and I as chief evangelists, but others as well – have become low-grade Internet celebrities as a result.</p>
<p>Of course, then the honeymoon was over.  The people in this story don’t matter any more.  The voices around the table – and there are more of them – are those of Microsoft, Sun, IBM, Adobe, and so on, not of individuals. There’s less debate and more posturing. Some voices are lightweights and add little value, but each jealously demands its time slot. </p>
<p>This isn’t about technology any more, and certainly not people, it’s business.  The Internet business, for all the visionary rhetoric, has to do with nothing but money and power and executive ego. </p>
<h2 id='p-26'>Dinner With Ted</h2>
<p>Spring 1998 in Brisbane, Australia.   This is the 1998 version of the same conference where, in 1996, the XML idea was born. This is the official World Wide Web conference, and Ted has been invited to receive an award for his contributions; in his remarks, he hushed the thousand-odd people in the room, saying “Thank you.  This is a first; nobody’s ever given me an award before.”  </p>
<p>That evening, someone organizes a dinner date for Ted and a bunch of the XML tribe, including Jon and Eve and me.  It’s a lovely restaurant on the riverfront with good food and good wine and lots of it (Australia’s like that). A warm wind blows in scents of the Great Barrier reef. We talk and talk about fine books and fine computer programs and fine food, and we disagree often, at high volume and in high good humor.  </p>
<p><i>It’s all luck, it’s just luck</i> sings Joni Mitchell, and we’re in a profession and at a time where there’s a lot of it about; still, sharing laughs around the table, on the waterfront under Southern stars, with an inventor of the world you work in, that’s really a lot of luck.</p>
<h2 id='p-27'>James and Lauren and Tim</h2>
<p>Spring 1998, late evening in a hotel lobby in Seattle.  We’re at the first-ever big commercial XML conference; though poorly marketed and programmed, it’s drawn over seven hundred people out of the woodwork.  Clearly we’re catching a good break in the Internet wave.  James, true to form, has hidden for a few weeks in Bangkok and quietly built some XML software that is the best and fastest anywhere.  From the stage on the morrow it will be announced that it’s getting wired into two of the Internet’s most influential software suites (Mozilla and Perl, for those who know such names).  We’ve realized, over dinner, that James’ working name for his code, xtok (sounds like something you buy at a head shop), just won’t do. </p>
<p>We sip a good local beer and have fun with names… James is settling on expat, which might stand for “excellent XML processor and toolkit”, on top of which he is one.  Then a bloated suited Industry Leader sees us inexplicably ignoring all the other suited Decision Makers drawn northwest by the smell of money rising over a new acronym.  He butts in to offer his opinion on Strategic Media Convergence or some such, so we finish our beers and go to bed.</p>

<p>I have written here before about
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/05/24/Lanes">alleys and back lanes</a> and

recently learned how to walk and this has been the first couple of days of
decent weather since.</p>
<p>She sure enjoyed it, and thank goodness for the camera; it’s amazing how

<title>Them Bits</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Earlier this evening, I finished scanning the slides I have that
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">my Dad</a> took.  That’s a lot
of slides and a lot of bits.  With observations about Wal-Mart and Ubuntu and
the end of optical storage.</p>
<p>I’ve written about this scanning project
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/02/Scanner">here</a> and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/03/27/Scanner">here</a> and repeatedly
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=fss&amp;as_sitesearch=tbray.org">here</a>
and most recently
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2008/01/26/Fifties-Pix">here</a>.</p>
<p>It’s a milestone.  There are still some left from my pre-digicam years
with Lauren, and I’m looking forward to those.  But, five years in, I’m way
more than half-way through the job.</p>
<p>So I scan ’em on WinXP on a Sun Ultra using the laughably-ugly NikonScan
software that I’ve become pretty deft with.  Then I switch to Ubuntu to blast
’em onto DVDs.  On Ubuntu everything’s faster and there are no irritating
popups and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/19/Ubuntu-DVD-Writer">writing DVDs Just Works</a>, and I suffer cognitive dissonance while
noting which of these is ubiquitous and which is geeky.</p>
<p>Except for, I ran out of writeable DVDs last time I dumped.
Coincidentally, Lauren and I had to go into a Wal-Mart the other day, the
first time in years, and my whole nervous system just about imploded.  The
amount of stuff in those places, who could possibly need it all?  Anyhow I
figured they’d have to have DVD blanks, and they did, except for the price for
50 was only a buck more than the price for 20 so that’s what I had to buy.</p>
<p>And I’m thinking, maybe this is the last writeable optical media I’ll ever
buy.  USB keys are getting close in size and you can write ’em a whole lot
faster, and they don’t occupy any more space, really.  The notion of using
them for long-term storage hasn’t caught on, but it’s only a matter of time.</p>

<title>Virtual Indiana</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I got the networking working on yesterday’s Indiana + VirtualBox + Mac
install, but not well. I think
<a href="http://homepage2.nifty.com/mrym3/taiyodo/ae-2.6.0a.tar.gz#../ae-2.6.0a.tar.gz">that driver</a> needs some work, 
it seems to lock up on big data
transfers.  Anyhow, just for fun, I brought over a 22-meg 5782×3946 JPG (a
slide scan, the first picture
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2008/01/26/Fifties-Pix">here</a>), and opened it
up with the Gimp under Indiana under VirtualBox under OS X.
And it worked.  It sure ain’t as fast as Lightroom, but then nothing is as
fast as Lightroom.  I pulled out the Levels tool and and blackened the
shadows a bit and twiddled the white balance.  You could live with it if you
had to.  That VirtualBox is more than a little OK.</p>
<p>And I have to say, Indiana feels pretty nice too.  Unlike any previous
Solaris experience, I didn’t have to, you know, <em>think</em> about the
infrastructure.  The shell worked like I expected.  Commands like
<code>tar</code> and
<code>make</code> and so on worked like I expected. Gnome worked like I
expected. Those guys are on the right track.</p>

<title>The Big Switch</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Clearly, 
<a href="http://www.roughtype.com/">Nicholas Carr</a> disapproves of much of the culture in which
I’ve immersed myself and which I nearly-wholly embrace, to which I would apply
labels such as “online” or “Web” or “Internet” or “Twenty-first century”.
(Carr and I have written
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/09/Carr">back</a> and 
<a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2006/08/ongoing.php">forth</a>
already on the generalities.)
So it would be reasonable to suspect me of bias in writing about his 
recent <a href="http://www.nicholasgcarr.com/bigswitch/">The Big
Switch—Rewiring the world, from Edison to Google</a>.
And indeed, I do think that several of its key arguments are, well,
<em>wrong</em>.  But it’s a good book anyhow; 
well written and extremely apposite.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Outline</h2>
<p>The book embeds three themes, quite loosely
intertwined.
<i>First</i>, on the Really Big Analogy between Electricity and Information
Technology.  <i>Second</i>, on whether this Internet thingie is a Really Good
Idea or a Really Bad Idea.  <i>Third</i>, on whether the Net is an
Emergent Artificial Intelligence, and if so whether We Ought To Be Scared.</p>
<p>The first is the most interesting.  Jonathan Schwartz has riffed at length
on this theme as well, and the analogies between the electrical industry back
then and IT today are pretty compelling.  My disappointment here is that Carr
seems to have stopped before getting to the end of the argument.  Nobody in,
say, a small manufacturing business is going to write their own payroll
system.  On the other hand, nobody in the financial industry is going to
outsource all their modeling and risk work to someone else’s software and
infrastructure.  The interesting question is, where’s the dividing line, what
is the underlying pattern?  What decision procedure should a manager follow
to address the own-or-outsource question?
Planning a sequel, Prof. Carr?</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Emancipation or Control?</h2>
<p>The book has two halves: the second, <cite>Living in the Cloud</cite>,
opens with several chapters outlining the surprising reach of the Net and Web
in 2008.  This would contain no surprises for <span class='o'>ongoing</span>
readers, but is well-presented and likely useful for a general audience.</p>
<p>Then the fun starts, as Carr considers whether the Net embodies
“technologies of emancipation” or “technologies of control”.  His conclusion,
unsurprisingly, is that it’s about control.  The argument is worth reading
but I found it entirely unconvincing.  The Internet is about <em>people</em>
and that’s all it’s about.  People’s behavior is sometimes noble and sometimes
shitty, and the Internet doesn’t change that.  Given the chance to accrue
power, individuals and groups will usually take it.  When they misuse it,
other individuals and groups will try to break that power.  Sometimes they’ll
succeed and sometimes they won’t. There’ll be tyrannies and collectives and
complacency and insurgencies and wealth and poverty wherever there are people,
and I just don’t see how the Net makes any qualitative difference.</p>
<p>Hold on... I think what we have here is Prof. Carr predicting a sea-change
and me saying “Nah, nothing really new.”  Good.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Intelligence?</h2>
<p>The closing section considers whether the Net constitutes an emergent
intelligence.  It’s pretty disappointing; Carr obviously hasn’t researched the
miserable decades-long failure of the Artificial Intelligence project. He even
uncritically relays the exciting news from some AI lab: the researchers have
“already succeeded in creating a software program that can, at a very basic
level, ‘read’ sentences on Web pages and extract meaning from them—without
requiring any tags from programmers.”  Wow!  Stop the presses!  Someone call
Doug Lenat!</p>
<p>I’ve
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/06/24/IntelligentSearch">written about this
before</a>, but the core point is worth re-emphasizing: If we actually
understood what intelligence was and how it worked, we could maybe replicate
it.  We don’t, so we can’t.  (I suspect that someday we will; I’m not a victim
of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room">Chinese-Room</a>
illusion).</p> 
<p>Anyhow, it seems that I’ve been grumbling and grouching here, mostly.  But
to some degree that’s a compliment: if I weren’t engaged by the narrative I
wouldn’t have taken the time to go through it, take notes, and write this. I
think that most people who enjoy <span class='o'>ongoing</span> would enjoy
reading <cite>The Big Switch</cite>.</p>
<p>And the epilogue, <cite>Flame and Filament</cite>, is a perfect little
two-page jewel: startling, clear-eyed, and beautifully written; perhaps
itself worth the price of the whole book.  I’m going to quote the last
sentence: “It’s in this way that progress covers its tracks, perpetually
refreshing the illusion that where we are is where we were meant to be.”
Which is true even if you lose the “were”.</p>

<title>VirtualBox and Solaris</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Wow, we must have some pretty sharp M&amp;A people.  I’m no virtualization
guru, but I thought that at least I knew about the serious players.  But now
we’re 
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/tpm/entry/virtualbox">buying innotek</a>, who
make VirtualBox; I’d never heard of ’em but the reviews look good.  I tried it
out and learned a couple things.</p>
<p>First, there’s an OS X version which has a “Beta” label, but it downloads
fast (only 21M!), installs easy, and is 100% Mac-flavored, seems to more or
less Just Work.</p>
<p>The defaults are silly though; 128M of memory and 8G of disk.  Neither 
<a href="http://www.nexenta.org/os/Download">Nexenta 1.0</a>
nor the 
<a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/project/indiana/resources/getit/">Indiana
Developer Preview</a> worked, nor did either provide useful error messages.
Cranking the memory to 1024M and the disk to 20G got them both to install.</p>
<p>Nexenta couldn’t get out of console mode into X, but it seemed like a
perfectly functional Unix system.  Bug filed.</p>
<p>Indiana had Gnome running, felt perfectly snappy, but couldn’t see my
Airport network.  I filed the bug and there was a workaround posted this
morning.</p>
<p>VirtualBox tickles my fancy: small, lightweight, works.  Hmm... I wonder
how the Orange Box games will run on my Mac?</p>

<title>Ricoh GX100</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Officially that’s the
<a href="http://www.ricoh.com/r_dc/caplio/gx100/index.html">Ricoh Caplio
GX100</a>, but a camera shouldn’t need a middle name.  Mine arrived
yesterday.</p>
<img src="IMG_0012.jpg" alt="Ricoh Caplio GX100" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Why?</h2>
<p>You just gotta have a pocket camera, because the single greatest factor in
taking good photos is being ready to shoot when opportunity knocks.  I still
regret my deceased Canon S70, and while I got some OK shots with the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/04/27/Canon-A710-IS">Canon A710</a>, I never
actually <em>liked</em> it that much; the ergonomics were so-so and it
wouldn’t shoot RAW and the shutter lag was irritating.</p>
<p>On paper, the Ricohs scratch a few of those itches, then when I was
in Tokyo last year, it 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/06/15/Cameras">became obvious</a> that the
Ricohs are the preferred camera flavor among the Japanese geek contingent; I got
to fool with a couple of them and liked the feel.</p>
<p>If you look at
<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/ricohgx100/">DPReview’s take</a>,
it’s pretty negative, but the lines aren’t hard to read between: on the
upside, the
ergonomics are great, the wide-angle is huge, the thing reacts fast, and the
lens is good.  On the downside, the JPEG conversion is second-rate in anything
but really excellent light; and the dynamic range is not that great, it’s easy
to blow out the highlights.</p>
<p>Well, I’d normally shoot RAW rather than JPEG anyhow, so the really big
downside isn’t that big an issue.  There is another issue in that the RAW
write speed is sluggish, so you can’t shoot a whole bunch in a row.</p>
<p>Another alternative would be the much-ballyhooed
<a href="http://www.ricoh.com/r_dc/gr/gr_digital2/index.html">Ricoh GR Digital
II</a>,
with all the same ergonomic goodness and a neato prime lens too;
lately I’ve become a bit of a prime-lens junkie.</p>
<p>I spent some time poking around the
<a href="http://ricohforum.com/">Ricoh Forum</a>, and it seems that the GX100
lens is not significantly behind the D2 where it matters, plus it’s a little
more resistant to highlight burnout.  And damn it, a pocket camera’s about
convenience, so why not a zoom?</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Impressions</h2>
<p>I unpacked it, I charged it up, I turned it on... nothing.  Talk about a
mood-destroyer.  Had to go out, when I came back an hour later it was fine.
Go figure.  So, late at night, the lights low, I jammed the ISO over to 800
and took the first shot at what I could see from where I was sitting.</p>
<img src="R0010001.jpg" alt="Interior low-light test shot with Ricoh GX100" />
<p>Hey, the image stabilization is pretty good, that’s at 1/13 of a second.</p>
<p>So I snuck up on the cat and balanced the camera on a stool: ¼-second
shutter.  Fortunately, the cat held still.</p> 
<img src="R0010004.jpg" alt="Cat in low light by Ricoh GX100" />
<p>Yeah, there’s a lot of luminance noise in those, but... usable, I’d
say.</p>
<p>Today I was pinned by the phone/chat/email torrent from the moment I got
breakfast stuffed into the 
kids until like three PM, so after I got my shower I grabbed the Ricoh and
went around the block.</p>
<p>The first crocuses are starting to think about showing their faces.</p>
<img src="R0010014.jpg" alt="Young crocuses in dim light with Ricoh GX100" />
<p>I shot that one with both RAW and JPEG, and there’s no doubt that Lightroom
does a better job than the idiot software in the camera.  Don’t know how
visible it would be at screen resolutions.  Also, they’re right about the
sensitivity, I managed to blow out highlights even under the cloudy sky.
There are EV compensation tricks that the Ricoh Forum experts recommend, have
to learn them.</p>
<p>The ergonomics, even in the first 24 hours, are wonderful!  It’s easier to
switch ISO and resolution and so on than with my Pentax.  And in decent light,
the shutter lag is amazing, up there in SLR territory.</p>
<p>Hey, it even does <i>bokeh</i>!  The macro setting is <em>slow</em> but slick.</p>
<img src="R0010024.jpg" alt="Yellow early-spring flower with the Ricoh GX100" />
<p>Obviously there’s quite a bit of learning that’ll need to happen.  I’m in
California and Geneva over the next two weeks, and I’ll leave the SLR at home;
forced education.</p>

<title>The HTTP Sweet Spot</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We seem to have pretty widespread consensus, these days, that HTTP, or
perhaps the 
RESTful approach it exemplifies, offers a pretty sweet substrate for pushing
and pulling data around at Web scale.  We got further evidence this week when
a bunch of smart people stepped slightly outside its sweet spot, into deep
tangly weeds.</p>
<p>First, Joe Gregorio of Google, in
<a href="http://bitworking.org/news/296/How-To-Do-RESTful-Partial-Updates">How
to do RESTful Partial Updates</a>, proposed overloading PUT to
update resources in a way that’s constrained using
<a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/URI-Templates/">URI
templates</a>.</p>
<p>He got push-back from
<a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/2008/02/15/Embrace-Extend-then-Innovate">Sam
Ruby</a> and (more severely)
<a href="http://www.snellspace.com/wp/?p=889">James Snell</a>.  There is
thoughtful commentary from
<a href="http://www.mnot.net/blog/2008/02/17/post_patch">Mark Nottingham</a>,
<a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/rob-sayre/2008/02/15/restful-partial-updates/">Rob
Sayre</a>, and
<a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2008/02/16/ThoughtsOnGooglesProposalForGranularUpdatesInAtomPub.aspx">Dare
Obasanjo</a>.
I have three observations.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Wikipedia No</h2>
<p>I think Joe’s analogy with Wikipedia is bogus.  At Wikipedia, each entry is a
resource.  So is each section and sub-section and sub-sub-section and so on.
There’s nothing at all in REST to say that resources can’t be part of other
resources, and there’s no ambiguity at all what’s going on at Wikipedia.
Unfortunately, at Wikipedia there’s no way to do what Joe’s trying to: update
more than one disjoint section at a time.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>It’s Important</h2>
<p>The problem Joe’s trying to solve keeps coming up.  Despite my skepticism
about the analogy, I think his URI-templates approach is potentially
a winner.  Like Sam, I’m not crazy about verbs in URIs, but maybe, seen
correctly, these are adverbs.</p>
<p>There’s some history here, private and public.  Way back in 2004 I was
trying to get Google to buy into the APP idea, and had a meeting with Adam
Bosworth and Mark Lucovsky, who are obviously both heavyweights.
They both were friendly to the idea, but had an immediate question: You’ve got
a decent way to create or update a Web resource, but what if you want to
update ten thousand, can you avoid doing an HTTP exchange for each?
What about the idea of POSTing an Atom feed rather than an Atom entry?</p>
<p>I thought that sounded plausible; Google joined the Atompub WG and in
fairly short order the POST-a-feed idea came up.  And in fairly short order
after that, it got shot down.  People thought up all sorts of corner cases and
problems.  The two that stick to my mind were authorization and error
handling. Can you specify different auth data for each of the ten thousand
entries in the feed, and how do you react when twenty-seven of the ten
thousand fail to update for some reason or another?</p>
<p>I was disappointed, but thought “Well, YAGNI, maybe.”
Since then, there’s been Yaron Goland’s
<a href="http://dev.live.com/livedata/web3s.htm">Web3S</a> proposal, whose
<i>raison d’etre</i> was update at other than the singular-resource level.
(Hmm, wondering what happened to Web3S?)</p>
<p>So this is something that obviously keeps coming up.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>It’s Hard</h2>
<p>I have the advantage here of having spent three years
co-chairing an IETF Working Group, a role whose chief function is to discern
or decree the existence of consensus.  Speaking on the basis of that
experience, I can tell you authoritatively that we do <em>not</em> have
consensus here; rough, smooth, or any other kind.</p>
<p>But it’s <em>totally</em> worth arguing about.</p>

<title>Clink</title>

<body>
<p>It was late, everyone else long asleep.  I was walking between the dining
table and the kitchen counter (not a very wide space) when, from the
counter-top, I heard a soft little discrete clinking sound, some electronic
device wanting attention.  It would not be surprising for such a thing to be
found on our kitchen counter, but I didn’t recognize the sound.  It would be a
little more surprising, but not very, if the device on the counter
were unknown to me.  So I turned back and around where I could see the
counter, which was only moderately cluttered, and spotted no electronics at
all aside from a couple of battery chargers.  They multiply like bunny
rabbits
when you’re not looking, producing slightly variant hybrids that don’t work
with whatever needs charging next; then the original wanders away.  But I
digress.  I was puzzled but decided to let it pass, and returned to my
original errand.  <i>Soft discrete clink.</i>  I looked again: cookie jar,
bottle of wine, butter, chargers, extension cord draped over the back of
the counter, toaster.  Well, whatever.  Turn around, step, <i>clink</i>.  Wait
a second, there’s a pattern.  I was brushing the cord and its end was
swinging against the wine bottle.  It sounded amazingly like a friendly alert
envisioned and sculptured by a spiky-haired User Experience engineer in
Shibuya.  Real imitating fake, there you go.</p>

<p>“First Crocus of the Year”, I mean to say.  For me it’s a major transition

Not the best crocus photo ever, and probably not the best crocuses either.
But they’re important to me.</p>

<p>They’re late this year—all that unaccustomed snow—but once they started,
came up amazingly fast.  Just barely above-ground a week ago, showing a little

<title>Linux Aggro</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is getting a little weird.  Twice in the last couple of years, Linus
Torvalds has gone out of his way to diss Solaris, the OS technology and Sun
corporately.
Now, anyone who’s spent time on a mailing list with Linus knows that
his opinions are sharp-edged and rarely withheld.  But now we have a
pure 
<a href="http://www.linux-foundation.org/weblogs/amanda/2008/02/17/hey-jonathan-the-l-in-lamp-is-literal/">attack piece</a>
from Amanda McPherson, identified as “the marketing director of the Linux
Foundation”.</p>
<p>She goes on about how the L in LAMP is Linux and Literal; and how Sun in
general and Jonathan in particular are hopeless losers because there are more
of them than of us.  Oh, and because there’s a nasty little dispute in the
OpenSolaris community.</p>
<p>Well, let me be clear: I like GNU/Linux, in particular the GNU userland
part which I’m delighted to see the Solaris guys finally warming up to.  The
blog you’re reading runs on a Debian box and I use Ubuntu in my living room.
And I run Solaris for concurrency work and when I need NetBeans to go really
fast.  And it’s all just fine.</p>
<p>And yeah, the OpenSolaris community has had some foot-stomping of
late, and IMHO the Governing Board needs to do some Governing PDQ.
But, uh, flare-ups around personalities and naming and
so on are not exactly earth-shaking news in any of the OSS communities that
I’ve lived in. (Well, except for Ruby.  But I digress).  Perhaps GNU/Linux has
been blessedly free of such things?</p>
<p>But whatever.  Yes, there are more Linuxians at the moment.  I’m one myself
from time to time.  The software is good.  There is competition now.  This is
also good.  The childish sneering?  Not good.</p>

<p>Herewith a few random Atompub pointers.  Each month
that goes by, I’m happier with the way Atompub came out.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>AtomSub?</h2>
<p>Brian McCallister, in
<a href="http://kasparov.skife.org/blog/src/atomsub.html">AtomSub</a>, raised
a fascinating idea: “Would be nice to push an AtomPub endpoint to a service as
a callback for events... Instead of polling a site for updates, post a
subscription with an AtomPub endpoint as the entry and let the service push to
you.”  I would never have thought of such a thing; hmmmm.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Servers?</h2>
<p>Erik Wilde asks
<a href="http://dret.typepad.com/dretblog/2008/02/atompub-servers.html">AtomPub Servers Anywhere?</a>,
which says some smart things.  Mind you, he then follows some complaints about
the 
“frustration” of searching for Atompub server-side implementations with a list of
five, all in different languages.</p>
<p>Including
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Software#p-5">mod-atom</a>.
One reason I’ve been blogging less is actually because I’ve been working on
mod-atom, and frankly, it’s of no general interest whatsoever.  Yeah, I think
mod-atom or something like it is potentially an important piece of the
infrastructure, but its actual engineering, inside, is pretty boring.
I’ve figured out a trick for creating and destroying publications without
hacking the Apache config file.
Since then I’ve spent a few days, actually, thinking about how, in the
maybe-processes-but-maybe-threads httpd environment, best to keep track of all
the active publications when you’re adding and deleting them.  Which is pretty
hard to do efficiently.  But nobody would call it <em>interesting</em>.</p>
<p>While we’re digressing into the subject of my own software, Simon Rozet has
been
<a href="http://atonie.org/2008/02/ape-test.html">thinking about how to test
the Ape</a>.  I hang my head in lasting shame in that I haven’t been able to
figure out how to unit-test the sucker; let’s hope Simon is smarter.</p>

<p>In single-Dad mode on this brilliant Sunday morning, I decided to pack the
urchins up after breakfast and take them down to
<a href="http://www.granvilleisland.com/">Granville Island</a>.  It’s one of
Vancouver’s nicest things and too often we abandon it to the tourists
(In fact, on this occasion I helped a posse of Germans figure out the
parking-ticket machine).  Well, and I had a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2008/02/14/Ricoh-GX100">new camera</a> burning a
hole in my pocket.</p>
<p>First, let it be recorded that the trip was a smashing success.  I got new
slippers at
<a href="http://www.circlecraft.net/page128.htm">Circle Craft</a> (which is
really very good), the boy got a new rocket at the toy store, and the girl got
to toddle around, drop pebbles in the ocean, and chase birds; plus a
cookie.</p>
<p>While she and her brother were dropping things into this narrow gap between
the docks, I was pointing the camera into it. 
Puzzle:  Why are the reflected words in the second shot not mirror-imaged?</p>

<p>That S3 outage sure concentrated people’s minds.  And almost

really unattractive.  And you do hear <i>sotto voce</i> rumbles about going

<p>First,
<a href="http://www.gcn.com/print/27_2/45710-1.html">Library of Congress taps
Silverlight to enhance access</a>.  Second,
<a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/009989.html">Republicans Kiss
Google's Ass...</a>.  Spot a pattern?</p>
<p>The first is easy to understand, because we’ve seen it so many times
before.  I remember the relentless campaigns over the last decade, first
to turn the Internet from a Navigator app into an Explorer app, and second to
beat back the demons of Open Source.
There were all sorts of incentives to adopt cool Web-site features that were
IE-only, and the nicest imaginable Microsoft evangelists to explain the
advantages, and fatherly business types to pooh-pooh objections from any of
those scuzzy Open-Source commie hippies.</p>
<p>The formula goes: you find some organization,
not all that clueful about technology, you dazzle ’em with shiny
goodies, and you lock in another little piece of the Internet.
Well, it’s sad that the Library of Congress doesn’t want any visitors who run
Linux, or aren’t affluent enough to have upgraded to an Intel Mac.
Sad, sad, sad.</p>
<p>Now, Google and the Republicans.  That’s too complicated for me to figure
out, but it smells rotten (granted that in 2008, everything in
the neighborhood of the Republican party smells rotten).
Anyhow, read Jeremy Zawodny’s take, linked above.
I’d forgotten that when the time is right,
he can be one of your really superior flamers.  And the time does seem
right.</p>

<p>There’s this guy named
<a href="http://bahumbug.wordpress.com/">Nick Kew</a> whom I’d never heard of
till last year, when I started working on
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/misc/Software#p-5">mod-atom</a>.  He’s
one of the core
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">httpd</a> gurus, and
<a href="http://www.apachetutor.org/">wrote the book</a> on Apache Modules,
which is what mod-atom is.  So he politely tolerated a flurry of
clueless-newbie questions from me, and I feel guilty that I didn’t buy the
book.
Anyhow, he’s just
<a href="http://bahumbug.wordpress.com/2008/02/21/servant-to-a-new-master/">come
to work for Sun</a>.  I’ve already told him gleefully that I shall now feel
guilt-free about the questions.  But seriously, it makes me happy to be
bringing some more httpd expertise on board, given that it’s perhaps the
single most important software component of the whole World Wide Web.

<p>I see they’ve dropped the price of the basic iPod Shuffle to $49.
That’s the only iPod I have.  It’s a remarkable device, with enough songs and
enough juice to get you over the Pacific and back.  You just have to remember
to auto-fill and recharge before you go.
The ergonomics are minimal
and kind of perfect.
Now, everybody knows that the best gift for anyone is one you make yourself.
It seems to me that a pre-loaded Shuffle qualifies, at a reasonable
price-point.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, I gave shuffles to a nephew and two nieces.  I
thought of pre-loading them, but they wouldn’t be able to refresh them from
their own computers without blanking the music, so what would be the point?</p>
<p>At $49, it makes sense.  It presupposes you’ve got a computer with a few
dozen hours of music on it; many of us have.  You go and buy a handful of
shuffles for your friends and loved ones, and for each one, you pick out 16
hours of songs you think they might like, and let ’er rip.</p>
<p>If they don’t like your taste in music, they’ve got a little iPod they can
put their own on.  If they do, that’s a very personal gift.</p>

<p>Well, here I am.</p>
<img src="R0010160.jpg" alt="Geneva street with photographer’s shadow" />
<div class="caption"><p>It’s spring here!</p></div>
<p>The reason, of course, is to attend the
<a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/pressrelease.htm?refid=Ref1114">DIS29500 (OOXML) BRM</a>.

one-stop shopping.</p>
<p>And that’s <em>all</em> I’m going to say about the subject under debate
until, well, somewhat later.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Travel</h2>
<p>The trans-Atlantic slog from Vancouver is unpleasant, but then
the transfer gates at Frankfurt were like a hundred feet apart, and the hop to
Geneva is nothing.
At the airport there’s a machine that’ll print you a public-transit
ticket good for anywhere in the city.  I looked at the sun outside and thought
“screw taxis” and was downtown in minutes.  I thought the train station would
be pretty near the hotel, so I bought a map and sallied forth, was baffled in
half a block.</p>
<p>I summoned up my courage, shook some rust off the internal French-language
gears, and approached a policeman.  He was friendly and helpful; even walked
me a couple of blocks in the right direction.  And the French worked
better than I’d hoped.
Over in the German-speaking part of Switzerland, the German sounds funny.  But
the French here sounds ordinary to me.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Venue</h2>
<p>I thought I’d do a trial walk from my hotel to the meeting location.
Are there ever a lot of glass-faced buildings around here.</p>
<img src="R0010167.jpg" alt="Glass-faced building in Geneva" />
<p>Anyhow, when I got back to the hotel I realized I’d snapped the building on
the wrong side of the street from where the meeting is, but hey, it’s the

neighborhood, more ways than one.</p>

<title>Inside the BRM</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Well, we’re not supposed to write about the <em>substance</em> of the BRM,
but that still leaves lots of room for flavor.  I’m posting this
<em>(gasp!)</em> from inside the in-progress BRM.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Suits</h2>
<p>“Business attire” is the order of the day.  You’ve never seen so many
Microsofties 
dressed up.  The only one who really carries it off is
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brian_jones/">Brian Jones</a>, who looks
damn stylish.  I didn’t bring any jackets or ties.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Levels</h2>
<p>We’re on level three.  On level one is the
<a href="http://www.openforumeurope.org/geneva/programme/programme-update">OFE counter-conference</a>.  They have a
table set up where we walk to the elevator, like Baptists
outside a brothel bringing sinners to Jesus, or in this case Vint
Cerf.</p>
<img src="R0010177.jpg" alt="OFE counter-conference table" />
<p>Me, I ain’t going to either the OFE or ECMA (read Microsoft) events;
eventually I’m gonna have to turn one way or the other and pull the trigger,
and it’s gotta be clear that the only finger on it is mine.
<i>[Update: Well, I went to the ECMA reception because I had to lobby for some
votes and that’s where they were.  So if it ends up going the wrong way you
can suspect me of being influenced by ECMA’s booze.]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-4'>HoD</h2>
<p>Rhymes with “bod”, means “Head of Delegation”.  In theory, only they speak.
Arriving on the first day, I ran into my
old friend and XML co-conspirator
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makoto_Murata">Murata Makoto</a>, and as
I was greeting him
delightedly he laughed “Ha-ha,
I’m the head of the Japanese Delegation; I can talk and you have to shut
up”.</p>
<p>Actually, HoDs can ask their delegates to speak for them and frequently
do.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Influence</h2>
<p>It isn’t distributed evenly.  Any of the following give you an unfair
advantage: Being in the front row, being near the center, and having an
efficient, experienced, loud-voiced HoD.</p>
<h2 id='p-15'>Pixless</h2>
<p>We were also warned <em>sternly</em>, with dark rumblings about Swiss law
no less, not to take pictures inside the room.  So, this is from outside.</p>
<img src="R0010190.jpg" alt="Geneva alley" />
<h2 id='p-6'>Some Countries</h2>
<p>It’s unfair that your attitude to a whole nation can be changed by the
people representing it at an ISO event.  But it happens.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>Geek Stuff</h2>
<p>An individual power outlet on the <em>top</em> of the desk at each place, and
fast reliable WiFi.  The
<a href="http://www.cicg.ch/">Geneva Conference Center</a> is OK by
me.</p>
<h2 id='p-8'>Yawn</h2>
<p>It can get awfully slow sometimes.
<a href="http://adjb.net/">Alex Brown</a>, the convenor, has been
doing this for years, and I alternately admire his patience and wish someone
would put steroids in his corn-flakes so he’d start applying a cattle-prod to 
leisurely, badly-prepared speakers.</p>
<h2 id='p-9'>Maple Leaf Forever</h2>
<p>One reason I couldn’t say “no” is that I’ve never been asked to represent
Canada before, and probably never will be again.
Each delegation has a placard, wielded by the HoD, held up to
request recognition, or to vote.  Our HoD got tired one time and I got to hold
it up to cast Canada’s vote.</p>
<h2 id='p-10'>First-Name Basis</h2>
<p>There are no people, only countries.  At first, it’s weird hearing things
like “Finland has a question for South Africa”, but you get used to it
fast.</p>
<h2 id='p-11'>Tools</h2>
<p>The Mac “Preview” program is beyond wonderful.  I typically have many
tens of megabytes of OOXML spec-ware and comment-ware open in a dozen
different Preview windows and the frighteningly-instant search never slows
down perceptibly.  Mmmm.</p>
<h2 id='p-12'>Stage Fright</h2>
<p>It was going to be Canada’s turn to raise an issue shortly after lunch, and
we’d agreed on which, and that I was going to raise it, but we hadn’t
(quite) hashed out our consensus position.  So we
came back after lunch, and Belgium and Brazil both passed unexpectedly.
Our HoD handed me the placard and there I was with no safety net,
improvising what I thought I could say in real-time, looking at the rest of
the delegation out of the corners of my eyes.  I’ve spoken to two thousand
people and been way less nervous.</p>
<img src="R0010192.jpg" alt="Geneva shop-window" />
<div class="caption"><p>Find your own analogy.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-13'>USB</h2>
<p>Memory disks, I mean.  Progress would have ground completely to a halt if
we couldn’t pass around USB sticks full of PDFs.</p>

<p>Now that the BRM is over, I feel I can write about it a bit more; there are
some restrictions, but I’ll lay them out.  Summary: A lot of good work was
done, but the process is irretrievably broken.</p>
<img src="R0010207.jpg" alt="ISO OOXML Ballot Resolution Meeting (BRM" />
<h2 id='p-1'>Boundaries</h2>
<p>I’m not going to name any countries or their representatives.  That’s sad,
because it’ll cost this story some some colour and passion.  But it seems to
be the price of admission.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>History</h2>
<p>The OOXML vote was last September, and it failed, but not by much.  The
countries who voted provided comments; there were thousands, although lots
were duplicates of each other.  The editorial group who actually produce the
spec is referred to as “ECMA”, but in fact the work is mostly done by
Microsoft people.
They buckled
down and sorted the comments into just over a thousand groups.
I thought the groupings were sensible.</p>
<p>They accompanied each group with an “ECMA Response”; these became the unit
of work at the BRM.
I thought the Responses were in most cases quite constructive and
intelligent.  
But in aggregate, they comprised a frighteningly-huge mass of
changes to a frighteningly-huge document to be applied in a frighteningly-small
amount of time.</p>
<p>The Responses were numbered from one to a
thousand and change.  They were
bundled into a great big 14M PDF and sent to all the countries.</p>
<p>The business of the BRM was to vote on which of these Responses (or
variations) should be applied to the draft to produce something
that might convince enough countries to change their votes from “No” to
“Yes” to make this an International Standard.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>What Actually Happened</h2>
<p>The “convenor”, Alex Brown, a good guy in a lousy situation, called on the
countries in alphabetical
round-robin, giving each a chance to talk about a
Response (or related group of them), and potentially propose a change to the
spec. Of course, nobody’s going to spend time on Responses they’re already
happy with, so people focused on where they saw problem areas.</p>
<p>In theory, discussion was only on specific comments and responses.  In
practice, there was a lot of freedom, because many comments
were very general, along the lines of “Spreadsheet formulas are inaccurate” or
“Your accessibility framework is inadequate”, so you could propose
pretty well anything.</p>
<img src="R0010204.jpg" alt="Alex Brown" />
<div class="caption"><p>Alex Brown</p></div>
<p>During the first round, the proposals were a little soft-edged and
arm-wavy, but people got savvier as the week went on, bringing forward
crisp fully-edited deltas that had been worked through with the
Microsoft people and involved multiple nations.</p>
<p>We got through quite a few of these (I didn’t count, but dozens and dozens)
and
some of them were really big: reorganizing the spec, giving it a better
accessibility framework, fixing up i18n bugs, making the “Scope” statements
more realistic, cleaning up BCP47 language codes, making the schemas usable.  
Most proposals, once cleaned up, passed by consensus, a few came to a vote, a
few of those lost the vote.
Votes were simple majority, one per country, regardless of “O”
or “P” membership status.</p>
<p>Of course, most of the thousand Responses didn’t get addressed.  And the
rules apparently say that if it doesn’t get explicitly voted in, the change
doesn’t get made.  So there was a gang-vote where everybody could fill in all
the Responses they wanted to approve or disapprove, and even put in a default
approve/disapprove/abstain clause.  This only applied to the Responses that
didn’t get dealt with one way or another at the meeting.</p>
<p>Most votes on this were Yes, because whether or not you were 100% satisfied
with any given
ECMA/Microsoft Response, it was usually an improvement over what
had been there before.  So almost all the proposals that didn’t get brought up
at the meeting passed, which is quite sane behavior.  Obviously, we’d have
liked to have brought more up for further improvement.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>The Result</h2>
<p>Well, the version of the proposed ISO/IEC 29500 is somewhat better than
the version that got voted down in September.
It’s still (speaking only for myself and only about the technical design) not
very good, because with the best will in the world, the job was 
just too big to do in the available time.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>What Was Good</h2>
<p>The people.  With a very few exceptions, everyone really tried hard to
work together and make the document better.  Everyone freely acknowledged that
the job was way too big, but there we were for a week to take a run at it
anyhow.
I include the nations’ representatives and the ISO people and the Microsoft
people when I say this; they were, by and large, a pleasure to work with.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>What Was Bad</h2>
<p>The process was complete, utter, unadulterated bullshit.  I’m not an ISO
expert, but whatever their “Fast Track” process was designed for, it sure
wasn’t this.  You just can’t revise six thousand pages of deeply complex
specification-ware in the time that was provided for the process.  That’s true
whether you’re talking about the months between the vote and when the
Responses were available, the weeks between the Responses’ arrival and the
BRM, or the hours in the BRM room.</p>
<p>As the time grew short there was some real heartbreak as we ran out of time
to take up proposals; some of them, in my opinion, things that would really
have helped the quality of the draft.</p>
<p>This was horrible, egregious, process abuse and ISO should hang their heads
in shame for allowing it to happen.  Their reputation, in my eyes, is
in tatters.  My opinion of ECMA was already very negative; this hasn’t
improved it, and if ISO doesn’t figure out away to detach this toxic leech,
this kind of abuse is going to happen again and again.</p>
<h2 id='p-8'>What’s Next?</h2>
<p>The national bodies that voted on the first round have thirty days to
decide if they want to change their vote.  I totally don’t believe that
ECMA/Microsoft is going to be able to pull together a revised draft of this
Frankenstein’s monster in that timeframe.  That seems like a pretty serious
process issue to me, too.</p>
<p>In practice this means that the heavy politics starts Monday morning.
National bodies that are smart will make their decision between 8:30 and 9:00
AM on March 3rd and immediately go on long vacations in Tasmania or
Nunavut.</p>
<h2 id='p-9'>Why Me?</h2>
<p>I’m knowledgeable about the subject and my country asked me to go.  I was not
representing anyone or conferring with anyone who wasn’t in the room.
This is just me talking.</p>
<p>My thanks to Jean, John, Paul, Phil, and Uma for companionship, support,
wisdom, and a whole lot of hard work.</p>

<p>So, I got into the hotel room and found that blogging grumpily at my travel
and blogosphere problems didn’t cheer me up.
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren</a> and 
<a href="http://www.webmink.net/">Simon</a> each sent me
the number of someone I know around here, but I was just too pissed at
the world to pick up the phone.  So I picked up the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2008/02/14/Ricoh-GX100">new camera</a> instead and
went walking.</p>
<p>This suburb has a big park named Niedwald.</p>

<p>This ivy isn’t like anything in the New World.</p>
<img src="R0010214.jpg" alt="Ivy in Niedwald park, Frankfurt" />
<p>I’d say some spring cleaning is in order.</p>
<img src="R0010215.jpg" alt="Fallen tree in Niedwald park, Frankfurt" />
<p>There are definite signs of spring, like this willow.</p>
<img src="R0010222.jpg" alt="Early-spring willow in Niedwald park, Frankfurt" />
<p>By then I was hungry.  I grabbed a taxi to the

because I like train stations and they’re a good place to hunt
restaurants.</p>
<img src="R0010226.jpg" alt="Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof" />
<p>I felt so much better after some schnitzel and Pils that I wondered whether
missing breakfast and lunch might have been related to the earlier blues.
So I went on a random walk.  Here’s a shot across the river.</p>

<title>On OOXML</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I hadn’t really planned to become well-informed about OOXML, but I have.
So I thought I’d build my own personal list of reasons for and against OOXML
becoming an ISO standard.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I’m serious. Anyone who cherry-picks content
from this piece without playing by the rule above can count on hearing from an
attorney PDQ.</p>
<p>Also, this represents only my opinions.
They have been influenced by my twenty-one years of experience with XML and
its predecessors, my readings from the OOXML spec, the national
bodies’ comments on it, my discussions with my colleagues in the Canadian
advisory committee, the experience from the Ballot Resolution Meeting at
Geneva, and my colleague Lauren Wood.
My thanks to all those people; but if
I’m wrong about this stuff, it’s my fault not theirs.</p>
<p>And in particular, <strong>this
does not represent my employer’s position</strong>.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id='p-1'>Pro: It’s Not That Bad</h2>
<p>OOXML has received a huge amount of review.  I’m satisfied that as amended
by the BRM, it constitutes an accurate (although unpolished and incomplete)
specification
of the data format used by Microsoft Office, starting with Office ’97.
For example, I was impressed by the description of how Excel really
works inside, as reflected in the XML it writes.</p>
<p>The fact that it’s thousands of pages long really isn’t that much of a usability
problem; the PDF version is well-structured and nicely hyperlinked.  Assuming
you have some sort of decent PDF reader, if you want to find out how the
<code>CEILING</code> function works, or how fonts are assigned to the bits of
a PowerPoint slide, you’ll get there.</p>
<p>In fact, the guys at Microsoft who built the ad-hoc content-management
system for this project should be proud of themselves, and they should
write 
it up somewhere; I’m very impressed.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Pro: It Might Create a Market</h2>
<p>There’s a decent chance that the publication of OOXML will help build an
open ecosystem for people who want to write tools to read and write office
documents, which would be good for the world and Microsoft too.
I can imagine mining the inventory of documents for
Business-Compliance or accessibility-checking purposes.  Conversely, I can
see generating OOXML documents from other business applications.</p>
<p>Now, you’ve always been able to do these things; Microsoft’s publication of
the binary formats the other day was really a non-event, since they’d
long since been exhaustively reverse-engineered.
But this should reduce the cost and difficulty.  First, because XML is easier
to read and write than idiosyncratic binary formats.  
And second, because OOXML provides an
actual explanation of what all the bits and pieces are and what they mean and
how they fit together.</p>
<p>Now, for this to work, Microsoft is going to have to provide clarity as to
the exact relationship between its products and the standard, whether that be
ECMA-376 or a possible future ISO version.
But the scenario gets a whole lot more likely with a specification in place;
especially since Microsoft is shipping 70 million or so copies of Office per
year.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Pro: Reduce Litigation Fear</h2>
<p>Microsoft has promised not to sue anyone for
using either the ECMA or possible ISO versions of the  spec.
Granted, their covenant is not as clean and clear as Sun’s, and there
have been rumblings of suspicion from various quarters. 
But I think it’s pretty safe; Microsoft has created an expectation that these
formats are free to use.  Yeah, they could find a loophole and litigate
anyhow, and it might even work.  But it’d wreak so much havoc on their image,
and their relationship with the world, that it’d amount to a suicide-bombing;
they’d do some damage, but they wouldn’t survive it.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id='p-4'>Con: It’s Pretty Bad</h2>
<p>Treated purely as a spec for representing documents, OOXML is lousy.
Frank Farance of the US ISO delegation was quoted as saying there are probably
hundreds of defects.  He’s being way optimistic.
Every time I open it and start reading, I pretty soon come across some
unforgivably-ugly piece of XML or hideous piece of English grammar or
statement that just doesn’t make sense.  There are going to be
interoperability problems up the wazoo.</p>
<p>And while it received lots of vetting, the amount of scrutiny per page,
compared to the standards I’ve worked on in the W3C and IETF, is laughable.</p>
<p>Then there are proprietary issues: for example, for a variety of OOXML
elements, 
you can attach an attribute like this: <code>target="_media"</code>.  Which is
totally IE-specific, thus Windows-specific.</p>
<p>Then there’s the fact that at the end of the day, this is basically an XML
dump of a thirty-year-old computer program’s internal data format.  
Which severely compromises the data’s reusability; and I’ve always thought
that opening the door to unanticipated reusability is one of the big payoffs
for using XML.</p>
<p>There’s another big quality problem: OOXML allows the use of “custom
schemas”; i.e. you can enrich your documents with your own elements and
attributes, and still work on them with Office.
The problem is, history teaches that this is a terrible idea.  As far back as
the Eighties, people were doing this with SGML, and of course XML tried to
continue the practice.  It should be instructive that there were several
companies founded to build and sell the technology around this, and none of
them ever made any money to speak of; they’re gone.</p>
<p>Custom schema work turns out to be horribly complex in practice, in setting
up the editing and 
versioning and display and formatting technologies; a recipe for huge,
years-long, consulting engagements, and really lousy results.  Don’t go
there.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Con: Microsoft Will Use It As A Club</h2>
<p>Why does OOXML need to be standardized, since (in ODF) there’s already a
perfectly-decent standard for Office documents, being actively developed?
The official party line is that OOXML is <em>different</em> from ODF; all
about standardizing
a way to access the huge legacy base of office documents.  And that sounds
plausible.</p>
<p>But you know, that’s not how it’s going to be marketed.  I had a couple of
conversations with Microsoft people, raising the point that for most ordinary
office documents, OOXML or ODF would work about as well.  I got strong
push-back; they told me all about how the ODF approach is limited and
primitive and absolutely nowhere near as good as theirs.</p>
<p>So you can bet that the microsecond OOXML gets standardized, all that stuff
about legacy coverage is going to be forgotten, and we’re going to see a
full-bore global marketing assault about how this is the one true XML
office 
document format; bigger, brighter, better, and everything else is a toy.</p>
<p>This doesn’t strike me as a good outcome.</p>
<h2 id='p-8'>Con: ECMA-376 vs. “ISO OOXML”</h2>
<p>As a result of the process that culminated in the BRM, a
bunch of stuff was added to the input ECMA-376 document.  Most of it was
good, as in you can use IRIs as opposed to DOS file-paths for
pictures and so on, and it’s got some extra support for accessibility,
and so on.  But of course, none of that is supported by the
hundred-million-or-so instances of Microsoft Office in the field.
So if you’re an implementor writing data out, you better not use any of that
stuff because, well, it won’t work.  And even if Microsoft decides to include
<em>all</em> those features in their products, they won’t be in the field for
years and years.  Similarly, if you’re writing code to read OOXML, you can
pretty well skip the new markup, because there won’t be any of it.</p>
<p>So, if you believe the official story that OOXML exists to standardize the
huge legacy of office documents, it’s irritating that it now contains a whole
bunch of extra, hastily-added,
“this-might-be-nice” features that nobody will be able to use for
that purpose.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Con: Standards Process Abuse</h2>
<p>Microsoft decided, rather than working to produce a harmonized standard by
enhancing ODF to add MS-Office-specific features, to re-invent the world from
scratch.  <em>This seems wrong</em>.</p>
<p>ECMA, which claims to be a serious standards organization, blessed the
process of generating a XML dump of the internal data format and publishing 
it in
six thousand poorly-edited pages, in well under a year.  <em>This seems
wrong</em>.</p>
<p>ISO allowed ECMA to submit this on their fast-track process with
breathtaking obliviousness to the existence of other standards and lack of
concern for harmonization.  <em>This seems
wrong</em>.</p>
<p>ISO allowed
the draft to be substantially edited and enhanced <em>after</em> the initial
ballot.   <em>This seems wrong</em>. </p>
<p>It tried to repair the damage by stuffing 120 people in a room in
Geneva for five days to address a thousand changes to the spec.  <em>This seems
wrong</em>.</p>
<p>Thus, there’s an argument that this kind of process abuse shouldn’t
be allowed to go unpunished.  If Microsoft gets their standard, it’ll be a
signal to other big players to try to do the same thing.  If ISO gets away
with doing this, it’ll have two negative effects.  First, respect for
International Standards in general will be diminished.  Second, other people
will start trying the same thing.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id='p-9'>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Well, my mind is still open.
Locking Microsoft into a set of XML-based
document-structure rules they have to play by (even if they wrote the rules),
well, there’s probably an upside to that.
But on the other hand, I dislike OOXML at an engineering level and I
<em>really</em> dislike the cynical, abusive standards process it came with.</p>
<p>At the moment, it looks like we get the benefits (covenant not to sue,
stable spec), without the downsides (Microsoft marketing club, rewarding ISO
malfeasance) even if the ISO process fails.</p>

<p>Aw,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Healey">Jeff Healey</a> died.  I
liked most of his musical phases, and have a funny story.</p>
<p>I saw Jeff once in the biggest bar in a small Ontario town, in his
hard-rockin’ <cite>See The Light</cite> 
period.  It was straight-ahead fast rowdy electric-blues raunch, done well;
suitable for drinking beer and getting down, which everybody was.</p>
<p>Now, Jeff was blind, and played sitting down with the guitar face-up on his
lap.  Late in the evening, he stopped and made a little speech in his
distinctive boozy
raspy voice along these lines:  “Now, those a you who can see mighta noticed
that I’ve got the guitar here on my lap so I can get at it real easy
with both hands.  Those other guitar players hold ’em across their bellies in
the most awkward stupid fuckin’ position imaginable.  Dunno why they do
that.”  Hey, it was funny at the time, maybe you had to be there.</p>
<p>Anyhow, some years later Jeff got a radio show on CBC presenting his true
musical love, vintage jazz, dating as far back as the twenties.  It’s not my
favorite music but I thought I’d give him a chance so I tuned in a couple of
times.  The problem was that he’d had that CBC Voice Regularization Surgery
and sound like any other Regularized CBC Voice.  I liked the music better than
I thought I would, but it didn’t really sound like Jeff.</p>
<p>I’m going to have to pick up one of the records, for the memories.</p>

<p>So, what are these guys going to be working on?  I’m not sure.
While we’re using Python internally for

would call us real experts on the language.  So my opinion is that Frank and
Ted need build bridges to the community and figure out how we can

<title>Reflections</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>It’s a word for thinking, “reflection”.  That’s odd,
because thinking is more than echoing the world back to itself.</p>
<img src="R0010221.jpg" alt="Reflection in Niedwald Park, Frankfurt" />
<div class="caption"><p>Reflection in a German pond.</p></div>
<p>I’ve been thinking a lot recently, reflections of recent events much in
my mind and the
strata of communication, the distance between discourse and
polemic and marketing.  I do discourse all the time and polemic when I have
to.</p>
<p>If you don’t experience an event yourself—directly or via a recording—you
have no recourse but the reflections off others’ minds.  Which is all our
species had until very recently.</p>
<p>At the end of the day it’s unsatisfying, I want to experience
<em>everything</em> with my own eyes and ears and mind but nobody can.  So
it’s reflections, and oftentimes reflections of reflections of reflections.
They become stories and each story’s teller, even one not trying to twist it,
adds some and loses some.</p>
<p>At the end of the day it’s a miracle that “journalism”
produces anything remotely useful.  At the end of the day, the day’s story in
the words of a participant has fewer reflections and (let’s be
bold) more truth.  In the separate words of several participants, there’s a
hope of seeing the reflections’ imperfections.</p>

<p>Avis gave me one, and I liked it.</p>
<img src="R0010252.jpg" alt="Nissan Altima Hybrid tail-light" />
<p>It’s big, and while the lines are
kind of boring, the trim and lights and so on are pretty cool.  I drove
three other guys to lunch; there was plenty of room and I got gratifying
exclamations all around when I slotted the electrokey doohickey,
pushed the button, and whispered out of the parking lot.</p>
<p>It kept up in the fast lane on 101 just fine, and had a pretty
decent cockpit with a nice seat and radio and so on.</p>
<p>Anyhow, this big smooth coaster averaged just over 28mpg zipping around the
Valley for a couple of days; not bad at all.</p>

<title>Hard Problems</title>

<body>
<p>I spent quite a bit of today at the 
<a href="http://wiki.oreillynet.com/concurrency2008/index.cgi">O’Reilly 2008
Concurrency Summit</a>.  It was a congenial
crowd, but at the end of the day kind of a downer, because we have lots of
hard concurrency problems and not too many solutions.  Anyhow, two subjects
that came up were REST (which is concurrent at the largest possible scale),
and, unsurprisingly,
<a href="/ongoing/What/Technology/Erlang/">Erlang</a>.
And it struck me that they’re kind of like each other.</p>
<img src="R0010255.jpg" alt="Attendees at the O’Reilly 2008 Concurrency Summit" />
<div class="caption"><p>Left to right: Larry Wall, Brent Gorda, Allison
Randal, John Mitchell, Rob Bjornson.</p></div>
<p>Well, in REST,
a message sender has to know the receiver’s address,
there’s no global data, 
the receiver has to be waiting for the message, and 
the receiver will typically dispatch on its contents.  Just like Erlang.</p>
<p>By the way, that picture’s at ISO 400 and 1/15 of a second, dig the
anti-shake. The

<title>Camera Blues</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’ve bought two new cameras in the last month and they’re giving me
trouble.  If you’re thinking about
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2008/01/25/Pentax">one of the new Pentaxes</a>, or
one of those
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2008/02/14/Ricoh-GX100">nifty little Ricohs</a>,
maybe you ought to read this.<br/>
<i>[Update: The software caught up.]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Pentax Sigh</h2>
<p>I’ve been very happy with my 4-year-old
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/05/16/PentaxDSLR">*ist D</a>, the original
Pentax DSLR.  Except for, low-light shooting
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/11/09/Thinking-About-Cameras#p-5">is a challenge</a>.
The K20D, along with this snazzy new Samsung-sourced sensor that looks pretty
darn smooth at ISO 1600, has shake reduction.  Plus lots of other goodies like
weatherproofing and sensor-cleaning and lens-correction memory and so on.
So I got one.</p>
<p><i>[Update: The problem described in the next few paragraphs is now
resolved; Adobe just posted ACR 4.4 and Lightroom 1.3, which handle the RAW
files beautifully.  I took some ISO-1600 shots of my daughter in the bathtub,
and the smooth creaminess of the skin in the images is hardly to be
believed.]</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem is, the hardware is ahead of the software.  It can write RAW in
Pentax’s own .PEF format, or in Adobe’s candidate standard .DNG.  But Adobe
Camera Raw and Lightroom refuse to even try to read the .PEFs, and they’ll
read the .DNGs, but can’t adjust the white balance without damaging the
picture.</p>
<p>Following on this discovery, a little poking around the Web revealed that
that sure enough, it’s not surprising to have to wait a little while.
So if I want to use this thing, I can either shoot JPEGs, or I can use
Pentax’s klunky “PhotoLab” software to do colour correction, write out an
85-MB TIFF, and import that into Lightroom to tidy up.</p>
<p>So I think the K20D is going on the shelf for a while and I’ll probably
take the reliable old *ist D to Hawai’i on vacation later this month.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>[The fix showed up the evening before the plane to Hawai’i.]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Ricoh Bah</h2>
<p>I’m adapting to the Ricoh pretty effortlessly, though, and the software has
no trouble with its DNGs.  You really gotta watch the dynamic range, it’s dead
easy to blow out highlights; but I’m getting the hang of working around
that.</p>
<p>The only problem is that it’s defective.  The CRT on the back usually
doesn’t come on when you turn the camera on.  I’ve learned that if you thump it
on the back just right, it’ll come on for a while.</p>
<p>The trouble is that the only way to buy a Ricoh in North America is via
“Adorama”, a big camera store headquartered in New York.  So I called them to
say “The Ricoh’s defective” and they said “Sorry, you’ve had it more than two
weeks so that’s between you and Ricoh”.  Which probably means my nice little
camera will be taking a round-trip to Japan.</p>
<p>Which means that my Hawai’i pocket camera is going to be the little Canon
that I’d been meaning to give to the boy.</p>
<p>So to express my feelings, I’m going to include this picture from Geneva
that I took with my cellphone.  Who needs fine cameras anyhow?</p>
<img src="Photo-0023.jpg" alt="Cellphone picture from Geneva" />
<h2 id='p-4'>Lessons</h2>
<p>I guess I should 
find a mountaintop somewhere and contemplate the wisdom, famously introduced by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha">Siddhārtha Gautama</a>
and lately reinforced by pomo-guru
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckhart_Tolle">Eckhart Tolle</a>, 
about 
attachment to things of this world being the upstream source of human pain.

<title>Teleregression</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>When I moved into my current office a while back, it came with
shared Internet and no phone.   So, I got myself a Vonage account and, with
that and 
my cellphone, I thought I’d be OK.  Wrong.</p>
<p>The problem is that the Internet connection isn’t that reliable.  The throughput is
good, the latency is good, it just for some reason checks out briefly a few times a day.
This doesn’t make Vonage happy if there’s a call in progress.  Since my main
telephone usage is big long conference calls, I was suffering real pain.  I
switched those to my cellphone, but my monthly bill veered ino brutal
and stayed there.</p>
<p>So I gave up and called up the local telco and ordered what we used to call
POTS—Plain Old Telephone Service.  It’s like $30/month.</p>
<p>They said it’d be
installed on a certain Monday but I didn’t hear anything and I assumed they’d
get around to it.  A couple of weeks later, I got a bill.  So I called and
complained and they said “but we switched the circuit on at head office, you
should be fine.”  But I didn’t see any jacks in the room, so I had them send a
guy, they warned me there’d be a charge.</p>
<p>My office is on a main street called Main Street in a building that is old and wasn’t much to
speak of when it was new. It’s over a clothing boutique and a café.  The telco
guy showed up on schedule and spent a couple hours tracing antique cabling
around dusty crawlspaces right over the bakery’s main oven. I felt really
sorry for him but he maintained his good cheer.</p>
<p>Eventually he declared victory and said “That installation charge?  Forget
it, I think I just fixed up eight severe safety-code violations.”</p>
<p>So now I have an old-fashioned land-line.  Wow!  The voices are so clear, and
there’s only static when I’m talking to someone on a cellphone or Vonage or
Skype or something, and it never goes down.</p>
<p>I had the cutest little postmodern cordless Panasonic phone plugged into
Vonage, but 
its battery life was unsatisfactory, so I went to Office Depot and bought this
big streamlined plastic phone allegedly made by someone called “AT&amp;T”, I
wonder what that could stand for?  And the handset is connectd by this thing
called a “wire”, remember those?</p>
<p>It’s got a superb speakerphone, and works great with my Plantronics
headset, and great big keys that you just can’t miss, and my stress level
around teleconferences has gone to zero.</p>
<p>Telephonically, I’m in 1985, and it feels just fine.</p>

<title>Tolkien at Bedtime</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Our eight-year-old reads perfectly well; mostly childish trash, of course,
which is perfectly appropriate.  But he still likes his bedtime story, so we’ve
been tackling larger works.  We spent the last few months working through
<cite>The
Lord of the Rings</cite>, and finished it this evening.  I’ve certainly
enjoyed it, although sometimes the endless descriptions of pastoral beauty
can drag a bit in spoken-word format.  Herewith a nifty Middle-Earth resource
and a quotation from the book that touched me.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Map</h2>
<p>I wanted to print out a map so the boy could follow the action along;
Tolkien’s own are really inadequate.  Fortunately, there’s the “MearthMap”
<a href="http://www.lords-of-blah.nl/mearth/mearthmap.html">Map of
Middle Earth</a>, and it’s astounding.  It’s in vector format (a 1.2M PDF),
which means effectively infinite scaling, which it turns out you really need
if you want to be able to locate Dimrill Dale or Durthang.  I extracted just the
part of the map where the action occurs and printed it out on a huge glossy
sheet of paper and it was a fine companion to the story.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>From the Foreword</h2>
<p>This long paragraph pleased me for a bunch of reasons, and I thought it
might touch some others too.</p>
<blockquote><p><cite>The Lord of the Rings</cite> has been read by many people
since it finally appeared in print; and I should like to say something here
with reference to the many opinions or guesses that I have received or have
read concerning the motives and meaning of the tale.  The prime motive was
the desire of a tale-teller to try his hand at a really long story that would
hold the attention of readers, amuse them, delight them, and at times maybe
excite them or deeply move them.  As a guide I had only my own feelings for
what is appealing or moving, and for many the guide was inevitably often at
fault.  Some who have read the book, or at any rate have reviewed it, have
found it boring, absurd, or contemptible; and I have no cause to complain,
since I have similar opinions of their works, or of the kinds of writing that
they evidently prefer.  But even from the points of view of many who have
enjoyed my story there is much that fails to please.  It is perhaps not
possible in a long tale to please everybody at all points, nor to displease
everybody at the same points; for I find from the letters that I have received
that the passages or chapters that are to some a blemish are all by others
specially approved. The most critical reader of all, myself, now finds many
defects, minor and major, but being fortunately under no obligation either to
review the book or to write it again, he will pass over these in silence,
except one that has been noted by others: the book is too
short.</p></blockquote>

<title>NetBeans &amp; C</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’ve been using NetBeans for my
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Software#p-5">mod-atom</a> work for a while now, and
while it was better than Emacs, the C support has still had a way
to go.</p>
<p>In particular, the March 7th pre-6.1 snapshot fixed a lot of my irritants:
Apache-style indenting works, it sorts out the complicated snarl of
<code>#include</code> files properly, and the new-project
dialogue is easier to understand.</p>
<img src="NB61.png" alt="NetBeans editing C code" />
<p>Now autocomplete knows all the included names,
not just my own.  Pity C doesn’t have Javadocs; Doxygen hooks maybe?</p>
<p>The Apache httpd culture tends to a relatively small number of relatively
huge C files.  I’ve gone along.  The feature that tempted me away from
Emacs is the Navigator; you just hover over this little button and this thing
pops up... a really nice way to navigate around a big honkin’ C file.</p>
<img src="Navigator.png" alt="NetBeans Navigator on a big C file" />
<p>For my next trick, I have to get this thing to debug httpd with my
dynamically-loaded module, which is pretty hairy even from the command line.
It wouldn’t work previously, but on a recent trip
to the Mothership, I tracked down the actual developer whose problem it is,
and he says it should now. But if it doesn’t, Gordon will be hearing from
me.</p>
<p>Now that NetBeans is working a little better, and the OOXML process is
about done, my excuses for avoiding the boring (but important, I think)
mod-atom work are fading away.</p>

<p>The middle flower has been splashed with bits of soil by the just-ended
rainstorm, and I thought about picking them off but ended up liking them.</p>
<p>These photos highlight both a strength and a weakness of the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2008/02/14/Ricoh-GX100">GX100</a>.
On the upside, the Macro setting is absolutely fabulous.  People have
complained that the autofocus is a little slow and yeah, it zooms back and
forth for a second or more before it locks on.  So what?  I use Macro to shoot
things like flowers and rocks that hold still, so I don’t care.  When it locks
on, it’s <em>on</em>, the depth-of-field seems to be just what you’d want, and
the <i>bokeh</i> pleases my eye.</p>
<p>On the downside?  The dynamic range is limited, and thus it’s really easy
to blow out the highlights.  That middle flower is partly white, and this is my
third attempt to photograph it; the first two lost the whites.  Under a
brightish grey sky, I had to knock the AE correction down to -0.7EV to get
what you see here.</p>

<title>Compact Camera Talk</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last month at the
<a href="http://2006.northernvoice.ca/moosecamp">Moose Camp</a>, I gave a
short talk on high-end compact cameras.  I whipped it up in a few minutes,
made a
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/tmp/nvpc.html">links page</a>, and the whole
thing was well under ten minutes.  It was fun.  It turns out that
<a href="http://brucesharpe.blogspot.com/">Bruce Sharpe</a> was in the
audience with a video camera, and he polished up and published it under the
title 
<a href="http://brucesharpe.blogspot.com/2008/03/northern-voice-2008-best-compact.html">Northern Voice 2008: Best Compact Cameras</a>.
The quality is remarkable, particularly when you consider that the whole
exercise cost Bruce approximately nothing.
If anyone reading this is interested in a point-&amp;-shoot with
pretensions, they might find it useful.  But here’s what’s interesting: in a
world infested with videobloggers, any public utterance, no matter how
off-the-cuff, is, potentially, an audiovisual publication.  A permanent one.</p>

<title>Scoring OOXML</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I know a lot of people are interested in the OOXML process.  As a guide
for spectators, here are the facts about voting, to help you in making your
own useless predictions.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Mechanics</h2>
<p>There are two types of national members, “P” (first-class) and “O” (second-class).
Their definitions are irrelevant for this discussion.</p>
<p>There are three possible votes: “Approval”, “Disapproval”, and
“Abstention”.  To pass, you have to get
two-thirds or better Approval votes from the P-members <em>who vote</em>,
as well as less than than one-quarter “Disapproval” votes from all members
<em>who vote</em>.
I’ve highlighted “who vote” because these calculations don’t include
Abstention votes; this is important.</p>
<p>In the first round, OOXML almost but not quite met the
“less than 25% negative” threshold, missing (as I calculate it) by one
vote.</p>
<p>Among the P-members, there were 17 in favor, 15 against, and 9
abstentions.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Next Round</h2>
<p>Up till March 29th, any of the first-round voters can change their votes to
any of the three options.
But no new nations can join the vote, nor can any nation change their
P/O-member status.
It seems likely that if enough P-member votes shift to get OOXML the
two-thirds it needs, that’ll probably also clear the “less than 25% negative”
threshold. So it’s those P-member votes that are interesting.</p>
<p>In the simplest case, if five P-members shifted from Disapproval to
Approval, OOXML would be home free.  But it would be entirely unsurprising if
one or more nations made other shifts: all of Approval to Disapproval, Approval to
Abstention, Abstention to Disapproval, Abstention to Approval, and Disapproval
to Abstention are
perfectly plausible.
Each of those changes the arithmetic in its own special way.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>My Prediction</h2>
<p>First of all, I predicted that OOXML would sail through on the first
ballot, so what do I know?
Having said that, here’s what I think: It’ll be decided in Europe.</p>

<title>Service in 2008</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>What happened was, I wanted to buy a
<a href="http://www.ricoh.com/r_dc/caplio/gx100/">Ricoh GX00</a> and, in North
America, there’s only one place to do that: Adorama (gotta love that name), a
New York camera store with online pretensions.  It didn’t work out well, but
while we don’t know yet if the story has a happy ending, it certainly has a
silver lining.</p>
<p>When I unboxed the camera and charged the battery and turned it on, it
didn’t turn on. Which is to say, the LCD on the back didn’t light up.
Eventually it did, but then sometimes it didn’t.  I learned that if you gave
it a few gentle thumps the LCD would eventually turn on and then it would
take some pretty damn good pictures (see
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2008/03/07/Erlang-and-REST">here</a> and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2008/03/11/Purple-Raindrops">here</a>).</p>
<p>But the required thumping kept getting harder and I could see where this
was heading, so I called up Adorama.  After a few busy signals and a half-hour
on hold, they told me to fuck off and die, because it was more than 14 days
since they’d shipped the camera.  “Contact Ricoh.”  Hey, Adorama, the feeling
is mutual.</p> 
<p>So I went poking around and called up the Ricoh office in Vancouver.  The
good news is that after only a couple of minutes of navigating the voicemail
menu I got a human.  The bad news is that she said “We don’t sell that
product. Call Ricoh USA”.  Which I interpret as “Fuck off and die”.  Hey Ricoh
Canada, the feeling is mutual.</p>
<p>So I went and poked around Ricoh’s US website.  I found the
<a href="http://www.ricoh-usa.com/about/salesandservice.asp">Sales and Service
Locations</a> page, and there was a drop-down menu to identify the product.  The
bad news is that 
the list of products didn’t include digital cameras.  Which I interpret
as “Fuck off and die”.  Hey Ricoh USA, the feeling is mutual.</p>
<p>Then I noticed this text halfway down the page, way below the fold, that
said “SALES/SERVICE
LOCATIONS FOR DIGITAL CAMERAS” with a phone number, so I called it.</p>
<p>On the second ring, Brandy picked up the phone.  She was friendly and
intelligent, wanted to know the exact model and where I’d bought it.  She said
“You have to send us the camera.  The smartest thing is I email you the forms
with our address and the stuff to fill in. What’s your address?  And give me
your phone number in case it bounces.”</p>
<p>So I did and she did and the camera is currently on an airplane heading for
Chandler, Arizona, along with the forms and the proof-of-purchase.  Unless
they’re lying, this should be a freebie warranty job.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Lesson</h2>
<p>At one level, it sucks that Ricoh built a defective product, and it sucks
that Adorama wouldn’t deal with the problem, and it sucks that Ricoh Canada
wouldn’t deal with the problem, and it sucks that Ricoh USA makes it hard to
find the right place to go.</p>
<p>But in the twenty-first century, the fact that I eventually found a phone
number that an intelligent human being answered seems to override all the
stuff that sucked.  What does that say?</p>

<title>Time To Twitter</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I spend quite a bit of time talking about leading-edge Web stuff to
mainstream Enterprise types.  I have a well-polished explanation for the rise
of PHP and Rails and so on: Time To Market.  Here’s the sound-bite: “If you
and I have
the same good idea for a community-based Web site on the same day, and mine is
on the air in five months and yours in eight, then <em>you’re dead</em>.  And
it doesn’t matter if yours is better, because the community has gathered.”
Well, Twitter would be the canonical 
example.  They went with Rails because it let them build fast; and they built
fast.
They suffered terrible pain for months trying to take Rails places it’d never

<p>Years I mean, since I 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/02/27/Hello">launched <span class='o'>ongoing</span></a>;
I missed the anniversary last month because I was real busy in Geneva.
This will be fragment number two thousand eight hundred and thirty two. As I said a
couple of years ago, I have better things to spend computer-programming time
on than figuring out how many words that is.</p>
<p>So, to everyone, thank you thank you thank you for reading.  To my family
and co-workers, thanks for putting up with the side-effects; well, and for
providing the raw material.  These thanks are way more than courteous gestures;
finding this writing space is one of the best things that’s ever happened to
me, personally or professionally, and there isn’t a day that I don’t feel
grateful and lucky.  Lucky especially.</p>

<title>No UPS</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Lauren has
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/2007/09/12/ups-rip-offs/">already written</a> about UPS’s sleazy practice of slapping a
“customs clearance” fee on ground shipments from the USA to Canada; people who
are clued-in to this just don’t use UPS Ground any more.  Well, as of last week,
I’m not using UPS Express either; here’s why.</p>
<p>A couple of days ago I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2008/03/13/Service">wrote</a> about how after a
certain amount of irritation, I found someone intelligent at Ricoh to talk
with about my malfunctioning GX100; she faxed me a form to fill out and an
address to send the camera and form to; a repair/logistics specialist that I
guess Ricoh is outsourcing this too.</p>
<p>Since my regular office-services place is a “UPS Store”, the default
shipping option was UPS, and the price seemed right, so I packaged the camera
up and sent it off.  A couple of days later, I tracked the package on the UPS
website, and it said “Recipient has declined delivery, package will be
returned to sender”.  So I called up Ricoh and they called up the repair
facility and got this: </p>
<blockquote><p>It was refused because the package was marked ‘Prepaid’ by the
shipper. 
When international packages are marked in this way, it is possible for
us or Ricoh to be charged for the customs duties.</p></blockquote>
<p>I called the UPS store and said “WTF?”  They were puzzled too; “prepaid” just
means that I’d paid the UPS charges.  They called UPS HQ and ascertained that
indeed no customs charges were applicable, which is what you’d expect when
sending something for repair.  I called Ricoh back with the news, and after a
couple of more back-and-forths, she called me back to say they’d accept the
delivery.</p>
<p>But she copied me on the email trail; here are a couple of excerpts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just an FYI—UPS always states there are no fees for duties/taxes and
then send us a bill a month later. This is why we have started refusing
any shipment coming in as Prepay Paid.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>This has been an on-going issue
with UPS and this is why we made this policy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, bear in mind: If you ship anything trans-border via UPS, it may get
bounced, the cause being what really looks like generally sleazy UPS
behavior.</p>
<p>I think I’ll just steer clear in future.</p>

<title>No W Suites</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I regularly visit Sun’s big Menlo Park campus, which at the west end of the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/05/04/Dumbarton">Dumbarton bridge</a>.  I’d
developed the habit of 
staying at the W Suites in Newark, at the east end of the bridge;
convenient, and the bridge commute is scenic and refreshing.  No longer.</p>
<p>The W is kind of
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/11/23/TheFuture">hip and funky</a>, the rooms
are decent, the restaurant 
and bar are open late, and Sun has an OK corporate rate.</p>
<p>It’s always irritated me that they charge me $10 for low-quality Internet
access.  Well, on my most recent stay, the daily charge is now $10 or so for
256K, $19 for faster “up to 2.5M” service.  In the Bay Area, this seems like a
sin against nature.  Especially since the allegedly-faster service was pitiful,
way slower than 256K; obviously all the rooms are sharing a single DSL or
something equally lame.</p>

<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/02/09/Buddha-Helicopter">written before</a>
about the Honen mission in Lahaina on Maui, but I’ll never visit this island
without dropping by.</p>
<p>Below, the main sanctuary from the steps leading up to the Buddha’s
platform.</p>
<img src="PS080062.jpg" alt="The large Buddha at the Honen mission in Lahaina,
Maui" />
<p>Places of worship that are adjacent to nice Pacific-island beaches are, all
other things being equal, better than those that aren’t.</p>
<p>There was a service in progress.  Sunday isn’t particularly sacred to
Buddhists as far as I know, but if you’re an American congregation, you might
as well schedule your gathering the same day as everyone else’s.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I crept up to listen to the chanting and the drums; they were
magical on this warm March day.  While it
would have been rude to steal a shot in the door at the worshippers, I did
capture a few Buddhist sandals waiting on the astroturf outside.</p>
<img src="PS080059.jpg" alt="Sandals on the steps of the Lahaina, Maui, Honen mission

<p>And then of course there’s the big Buddha; worth a visit and a picture any

<title>Island Food and Drink</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Herewith some words on real ale, fake wine, and Fran’s Island Grill, with
pictures for atmosphere and a recipe even.</p>
<img src="PS080256.jpg" alt="Maui sunset with palm" />
<div class="caption"><p>Establishing shot.</p></div>
<p>This trip is our first attempt at a vacation with the daughter in the
traveling circus, and the addition of a strong-willed 20-month-old in tow
has made it a
little tough for me.  The grown-up activities
that I’ve tended to enjoy, things like snorkeling, swimming, hiking, and
extended periods of sloth, are largely replaced by child-care.  Supervising
a toddler and an eight-year-old at the beach or pool has its charms, but I’ve
once or twice caught myself feeling sorry for myself because I’d rather be
doing something grown-up.  Whatever; time is on our side.</p>
<p>I’m happy to report, though, that we’ve still been able to eat well and
enjoy some grown-up drinks.
First, the beer because, well, beer comes first.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Ales</h2>
<p>The first trip to the 
grocery yielded two local products: First, the “Volcano Red Ale” from
<a href="http://mehana.com/">Mehana</a>; the site is a wiggly Flash-pit,
probably don’t go there.  Maybe bad Web design goes with bad products?
Anyhow, maybe their other beers are good, but the Red Ale is average at best,
you can find something better.</p>
<p>The other was the “Big Swell IPA” from the
<a href="http://www.mauibrewingco.com/">Maui Brewing Company</a>, and I liked
it so much that I’m going to run this picture I stole from their website.</p>
<img src="bigswell.jpg" alt="Maui Brewing Company Big Swell IPA" />
<p>It’s light-coloured and with a light malt background and is absolutely
loaded with hops, the aroma fills up your whole head.  I just can’t think of
anything better to counter the after-effects of a few hours on a beach or
walking up a mountain trail in the tropical heat.</p>
<img src="PS080226.jpg" alt="Mountains on Maui" />
<div class="caption"><p>From a mountain trail.</p></div>
<p>It’s interesting that this microbrew comes in cans.  The website doesn’t
say why, so I guess I’ll have to open another can to read the
explanation... hmmmm.
I’d reproduce it but it contains some fairly fanciful claims
about the environmental virtues of aluminum.  I can testify, though, that it
doesn’t seem to interfere with this beer’s flavor.</p>
<p>MBC has a brewpub, we’ll try to drop by before we leave.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Wine, Sort Of</h2>
<p>And now for something completely different... that first shopping
expedition also brought back something they described as “Pineapple
Champagne”.  In fact that would be “Hula O Maui Sparkling Wine” from
<a href="http://www.mauiwine.com/">Tedeschi Vineyards at Ulupalakua
Ranch</a>.</p>
<p>The question has to be asked: Can this be as bad as it sounds?  Well, no,
it’s not <em>that</em> bad.  But it’s not great either.  We opened it to go
with something light, but then we closed it again and had a nice
bottle of Okanagan white.  I was going to let it go, but Lauren stuffed a cork
in it for some reason, and that was good, because the next day I was going to
barbecue some 
chicken kabobs and she assembled the following marinade from what was
on hand:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hula O Maui Sparkling Wine</p></li>
<li><p>Some vegetable oil</p></li>
<li><p>Fresh-squeezed lemon juice (quite a lot)</p></li>
<li><p>Sam Choy’s Chef’s Recipe Pineapple Teriyaki sauce</p></li>
<li><p>Love</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The kabobs came out really excellent.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Lunch</h2>
<p>We were going through Wailuku and Lauren noted there was a craft-supplies
store she wouldn’t mind visiting.  This was on Lower Main Street, a cheerfully
grubby and industrious kind of place, 
just thick with eateries that are not particularly aiming at tourists.  We had
lunch at one.</p>
<img src="PS080237.jpg" alt="Fran’s Island Grill" />
<div class="caption"><p>Fran’s Island Grill, Lower Main Street, Wailuku,
Maui.</p></div>
<p>They gave us a quick, hearty, tasty, inexpensive lunch in a friendly
atmosphere.  I suspect that not that many tourists will end up on
Lower Main Street, but if you do, drop on by; tell ’em the haoles with the
Really Loud Toddler sent you.</p>

<title>Photo Notes</title>

<body>
<p>Remarks from the photo world, interspersed with uplifting
Hawai’i snapshots.  It’s about emotion, not just technology.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Emotion</h2>
<p>You want emotion? Check out  
<a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2008/03/random-excell-1.html">grief
at Arlington</a>, specifically Greg Heins’ take on this remarkable John Moore
photo.  Also take in the illustrated featured comment, and then Mike Johnson
uses this to launch a
<a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2008/03/cropping-a-duh.html">discussion
on cropping and its ethics</a>.</p>
<img src="PS080125.jpg" alt="Looking down from Haleakalā toward Kihei on Maui" />
<div class="caption"><p>They call Maui “The Valley Isle”; this is a view from
the side of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haleakala">Haleakalā</a> looking down at
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kihei">Kihei</a> end of the valley.  I saw a tough
Hawaiian-looking kid 
whose T-shirt said “Valley isle not <i>haole</i> isle”.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-3'>Reality</h2>
<p>Since I’ve just quoted Mike Johnson, here are a couple other things from
the last month that are worth reading: 
<a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2008/03/funny-that-way.html">Funny That Way</a>
and <a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2008/03/look-left-look.html">Look Left, Look Right</a>.
I think that all of us, as digital photographers, should worry more about the
truth, or absence of it, in our pictures.</p>
<img src="PS080206.jpg" alt="Dead palm leaf among floating plants" />
<div class="caption"><p>I think the brown thing is a dead palm frond.  Those
are aquatic plants it’s lying on, water-lilies perhaps?</p></div>
<h2 id='p-4'>Cameras</h2>
<p>That little GX100 that made me happy until it had to go off for repairs
(they say it’s coming back tomorrow) is getting 
<a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/cameras/ricoh-gx100.shtml">attention
elsewhere</a> too.</p>
<p>But the real photo-tech news, for me, is captured by this 
<a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgets/gadgetreviews/news/2008/03/gadgetreviews_prosumerDSLRs"><cite>Wired</cite>
survey</a> of “Prosumer” SLRs.
The take-away is obvious: All of these cameras are just bloody excellent.
Left to themselves, they’ll take great pictures for you.  If you’re in a
situation where you have to intervene (issues of focus or time or colour or
light) well, they’ll still probably take great pictures for you.  Unless
you’re a seriously major photographic talent, none of these will ever,
<em>ever</em> get in your way.
We are in the golden age of photography.</p>
<img src="PS080353.jpg" alt="Children with shark at aquarium" />
<div class="caption"><p>Children at the Maui Ocean Center (expensive, but not
bad) in front of the big shark tank.  This is the K20D, one of the cameras
<cite>Wired</cite> covered, and no fiddling
aside from cranking the ISO to 1600; an example of what a modern SLR makes
easy.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-1'>Sally</h2>
<p>I noticed, in Maui, that having an SLR is no longer an even
slightly rare or unusual thing; they were in abundance at any tourist
spot worth photographing, which in Maui is pretty well all of them.
I said this out loud and Sally remarked “Well, often it’s Dad with the SLR and
Mom with the P&amp;S” and that’s partly true, but only partly.</p>
<p>Sally’s our longtime good Aussie friend; we shared the Maui condo and
generally hung out.  She’s a good photographer too; her approach is different
from mine and, I think, instructive.</p>
<p>Her “good” camera used to be film but she just upgraded to a Pentax K10D,
one of the world’s great bargains now that the K20D is on the street.  She’s
had a digital P&amp;S for a few years.</p>
<p>Here’s how she does it: she uses whatever software comes with the camera.
She shoots JPEGs and mostly leaves the camera in auto mode and doesn’t look at
the user’s guide until she’s been shooting a few months.
She doesn’t crop or adjust or fine-tune or sharpen or mask or dodge or burn or
balance, she just deletes the duds and blasts the keepers onto CDs.</p>
<p>In the condo in Maui she said “let me show you last year’s pics” and I was
getting out my computer but she was heading for the TV.  She dropped her disc
full of JPGs into the DVD player and seemed to think that ought to work and
what do you know, it did, she figured out which button on the remote meant
“next picture”.  The TV was a little sluggish rendering them and
maybe the resolution was a little low and the colours not quite 100% perfect,
but Sal takes good pictures, and they looked just fine; we spent an enjoyable
half-hour or so loafing through them.</p>
<img src="PS080386.jpg" alt="surfers with sails near Kahului, Maui" />
<div class="caption"><p>This is just outside Kahului.
I don’t even know what this sport is called;
sail-windsurfing perhaps?  These guys were going like rockets and taking huge
leaps off waves and doing the coolest tricks.</p></div>
<p>So let’s see; Sally lets the camera do all the work, she doesn’t sweat the
technology, she doesn’t worry about the software, and she gets good pictures.
I’m wondering if maybe I have an attitude problem.</p>

<title>Better Feed Reading</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Like many infosphere natives, I deal every day
with a massive contradiction: On the one hand, I want to know what’s going on
out there, and on the other, I want to get actual work done.  
Recently, the getting-work-done side has been suffering.  So I
massively reorganized my feed-reading setup, and it’s helped.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>River of News</h2>
<p>For years, Dave Winer has been preaching the virtues of the “River of News”
approach to feed-reading: let it all go by in a big blended stream, look at it
when you have time, and what goes by when you weren’t looking, well, you didn’t
need to see it anyhow.</p>
<p>I’ve never been able to buy into that because there are certain people who
are important to me: for personal or professional reasons, it is unacceptable
that they post something and I not notice.
On the other hand, triage is clearly required.  And I’d rather not get
into mass unsubscriptions; there’s a reason for everything I’ve
subscribed to.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Buckets</h2>
<p>The key insight is that I just had to make up my mind and sort the feeds
into two buckets, one for the can’t-afford-to-miss stuff, the other for
everything else.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWire/Default.aspx">NetNewsWire</a>
has made this easy, but I suppose most other feed-readers would let you do
something similar.
At the top level, I have two folders, named “A” and “B”; damn, that’s original.
I keep 
“A” in expanded form so I can see who’s posted, and I navigate through it feed
by feed mostly with the next-unread key, with regular recourse to
mark-whole-feed-read.</p>
<p>The “B” folder is now a pure River of News, which is to say, in NetNewsWire
terms, the folder is collapsed and all the articles in the feeds show up
together.  I scan through these—there are hundreds—<em>really fast</em> with
the mouse-wheel,
clicking on the handful whose subject line catches my eye, then with one click
the whole feed-splodge is history.</p>
<p>I’ve cut my feed-reading time by a huge factor, and I don’t think I’ll
be missing much that I’ll regret.</p>

<title>Ruby News: Honey Pie</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’ve been building up bits &amp; pieces of Ruby news for weeks and weeks,
so this is a pretty sizable bright-red glob.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Sun</h2>
<p>Starting with my employer;  Check out
<a href="http://developers.sun.com/ruby/">developers.sun.com/ruby</a>.  
Our Ruby work has been a low-overhead guerrilla effort so far, and while it’s
been going well, it’s nice to see a little bit of corporate organization
setting in.</p>
<p>On the less-corporate side, there’s the work we’re doing with the
University of Tokyo.  Charles Nutter summarizes in 
<a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/2008/02/university-of-tokyo-and-jruby-team-to.html">University of Tokyo and JRuby Team to Collaborate on MVM</a>.
The potential benefits of having multiple virtual machines in one image—and
I’m talking about all the Rubies including the J and .NET flavors—are pretty
obvious.  It’s a nontrivial problem, which is why we’re doing it on a research
basis; so don’t hold your breath.</p>
<p>Oh, and then there’s Andrew Binstock’s latest IDE
shootout,
<a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-03-2008/jw-03-java-ides0308.html">Eclipse 3.3 or NetBeans 6.0?</a>
If you care about the overall verdict go read the article, it’s good, but what
I wanted to quote was this: “These features make NetBeans the best IDE
currently available for Ruby development.”  Mind you, I don’t expect either
Eclipse or TextMate to stand still.</p>
<p>Finally, I observed back during the Wide Finder work that Ruby wasn’t
running that well on the T2.  
I’m glad someone’s addressing that: see Darryl Gove’s
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/d/entry/ruby_performance_gains_on_sparc">Ruby
performance gains on SPARC</a>.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Duby</h2>
<p>No, this isn’t an even shorter name for the That President, nor can you
smoke it to get high, it’s evidence
that Charles Nutter ought to be paying <em>us</em>, he’s <a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/2008/03/more-fun-with-duby.html">having altogether too
much fun</a>.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Gemstone</h2>
<p>Avi Bryant’s
<a href="http://www.avibryant.com/2008/03/ive-had-a-numbe.html">Ruby and other
gems</a> describes a fascinating framework built by
Gemstone, a New York outfit you probably never heard of.  I personally think
that something like this might be huge in terms of making Rails scale
effortlessly to really big problems.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>The Other Side</h2>
<p>Not everyone is on the Ruby bandwagon, you know.  Karsten Wagner, in
<a href="http://kawagner.blogspot.com/2008/03/static-vs-dynamic-typing-part-2.html">Static vs ‘dynamic typing’, part 2: The personality-factor</a>,
offers about as reasoned a presentation of the virtues of static typing,
particularly in the large-project context, as
you’re going to find anywhere.  Example: “Static types create global
constraints which describes your program in a non-local way.”
I’m still on my Ruby honeymoon and remain unconvinced.  Perhaps the following
quote is central: “And that's is my problem with real TDD: It's again my
laziness. Writing and maintaining those lots of tests is essential for this
method to succeed - and I'm simply to lazy to do this.”  Well, I’d argue that
you shouldn’t do <em>any</em> kind of a large project these days without TDD,
but obviously, some people do, and maybe for them, static typing has a
positive ROI.</p>
<p>While we’re visiting nay-sayers, I’ve certainly enjoyed the ferocious
monkeypatching debate that’s been swirling about Ruby-land.  It’s obvious that
as long as Ruby remains Ruby, monkeys will continue to be patched.  But it’s
also obvious that it’s reasonable to worry about this.  
The reason-to-worry position is best outlined by Gilad Bracha in
<a href="http://gbracha.blogspot.com/2008/03/monkey-patching.html">Monkey
Patching</a>; he admits that “So far, I have no firm conclusions about how to

<title>Maui Ladies</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Here are three photos of two ladies taken on Maui, one of whom is addressed with a
capital L.</p>
<p>The first is in the Portuguese area of
<a href="http://www.mauicounty.gov/parks/maui/central/KepaniwaiPark.htm">Kepaniwai Park</a>.</p>
<img src="PS080192.jpg" alt="In the Portuguese area at Kepaniwai Park, Maui" />
<p>The next at the beach at the
<a href="http://www.pyccmaui.org/">Pāʻia Youth and Cultural Center</a>.  It’s
just north of the town, and a good place to stretch out and relax.  In fact,
Pāʻia is a little short on parks.
This one is also a haven for free enterprise.  On the other side of our
cluster of palm trees lounged three enterprising stoners (judging by the
herbal smells) who enjoyed the view and took calls on their cellphones, which
usually led to quick bike-trips into town.</p>
<p>I’m not suggesting that the lady in the picture is using drugs.</p>
<img src="PS080286.jpg" alt="Lady airing herself out at a beach just north of Pāʻia" />
<p>The final shot is taken in the Aloha Bead shop, also in Pāʻia, and I’m
pretty sure it’s the same Lady as in the first shot.</p>
<img src="PS080299.jpg" alt="At the Aloha Bead shop, Pāʻia" />
<p>Can’t have too many ladies.</p>

<title>FSS: Under Paris 1994</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Friday Slide Scan #34 (wow, it’s been over a year) is from early mid-1994;
views of Paris, including a couple I bet you haven’t seen.</p> 
<p>That time I was staying in big hotel at Porte Maillot; as the view reveals,
one of the few really tall buildings in Paris, which is aesthetically a good
thing, unless you’re a Jane-Jacobs-ian density-is-good type, which I am.</p>
<img src="0001.jpg" alt="View of Paris from the big hotel at Porte Maillot" />
<p>I thought the view looking down from way up there was charming.</p>
<img src="0002.jpg" alt="Looking down from the big hotel at Porte Maillot" />
<p>I was traveling around on the Métro, the only way to go.  I still
have a few tickets, Lord knows how many years old, in my wallet, for
sentimental reasons.  The Métro has its own smell, like nothing else in the
world.  Anyhow, there’s this one line where there a bunch of stations named
after foreign dignitaries.  One is called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_V_(Paris_M%C3%A9tro)">George
V</a>, after an English king of whom I know nothing.  On that particular
occasion, when I arrived early on a quiet Sunday, I found it was being
renovated.</p>
<img src="0010.jpg" alt="George V Paris Metro station, being renovated" />
<p>This was oddly visually compelling, so I stuck around and took pictures,
resolutely ignoring the Parisians looking askance at the demented gringo.
First, an empty frame.</p>
<img src="0011.jpg" alt="George V Paris Metro station, being renovated" />
<p>Next, a subway-advertising-poster palimpsest.</p>
<img src="0013.jpg" alt="George V Paris Metro station, being renovated" />
<p>Finally, the one old advertisement that hadn’t been (completely)
removed.</p>
<img src="0015.jpg" alt="George V Paris Metro station, being renovated" />
<p>Images in the Friday Slide Scans are from 35mm slides taken between 1953
and 2003 by (in rough chronological order)
<a href="http://www.textuality.com/BillBray/">Bill Bray</a>, 
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/08/11/MomsGarden">Jean Bray</a>, Tim Bray, Cath
Bray, and
<a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren Wood</a>; when I know
exactly who took one, I’ll say; in this case, Tim Bray.
Most but not all of the slides were on Kodachrome; they were digitized using
a Nikon CoolScan 4000 ED scanner and cleaned up by a combination of the Nikon
scanning software and PhotoShop Elements.</p>

<title>Rock &amp; Roll</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I don’t drive around town that much, but when I do, I like to listen to the
radio, and what I mostly like to listen to is rock &amp; roll.  Being a
certified old fart, over the years I’d spent quite a bit of time with
classic-rock station, but gimme a break, there’s only so much time in the
world you wanna listen to Pink Floyd and AC/DC.  So of late I’ve been finding
the radio parked on
<a href="http://cfox.com/">CFOX</a> (“The Fox rocks!”) and you know, it’s a
not-half-bad rock station.  I don’t recognize ¾ of the music they play, which
is perfectly appropriate, but I like at least ⅓, which is not bad at all for
anything that hasn’t passed through the filter of decades.</p> 
<p>Then, in Maui on vacation, we drove around a <em>lot</em> (our rental
turned out to 
be this vast purple Caddy, a very rock-&amp;-roll car), and I found myself pretty solidly locked on to 
<a href="http://www.x925.fm/">X92.5</a> (“Where Maui rocks!”) and while the
flavor was different, the ratios were about the same.</p>
<p>Which is to say, after all these years: rock remains a living art form, at
least near the Pacific.</p>

<title>Jennifer vs. Bingyu</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>If you’re near a TV tomorrow (Sunday March 30th) that gets the CBC, you
might want to take in the final of the world women’s curling championship;
that’s 10:30 AM Pacific.  It’s remarkably good TV, the contrast between
the finalists is stark, and it could totally go either way.   The semifinal
between Canada and Japan this afternoon featured a big comeback and a
hairbreadth finish.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingyu_Wang">Wang Bingyu’s</a> China
rink has beaten
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Jones_%28curler%29">Jennifer Jones’</a>
Canadians twice in the last week, but nobody thinks the final’s a foregone
conclusion.<br/>
<i>[Update: Well, it was kind of anticlimax; the Chinese switched their
strategy from aggressive to defensive and it fizzled, they never really hit
their stride, so Ms Jones and her teammates sailed through without much drama.]</i></p>
<p>Things to like: the women’s unselfconsciously small-town styles, the banshee
howls for more or less brushing, the furious synchronized grace of the
broom-wielders, the byzantine tactical depths when the house gets
full, the skips’ considerable (but very different) charisma,
the colours of the clothes and stones bright against the white ice.</p>

<title>On Twitter</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’m writing this in an airplane to Vancouver from Chicago.  When I get home
and read my mail, if
recent trends continue I will hear about a few new
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/home">Twitter</a>
followers, bringing the total up over one thousand.  I think that with
Twitter, something important is happening.  But I’m having trouble
figuring out what.</p>
<p>Let’s be accurate: This does not mean that there are a
thousand actual human beings reading
<a href="http://twitter.com/timbray">my deathless tweets</a>.  Quite a few people
try out Twitter for a few days or weeks, find it stupid or trivial or
irritating, and never go back.  And then some “followers” are actually
spammers: Twitter-feeds promoting some product or cause or person, who
“follow” others on the chance that the follow-ee will have a look at them.</p>
<p>So, of the thousand, how many actually follow?  No idea; “a few hundred”
would be my guess.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>What Is It?</h2>
<p>Twitter is sort of an extended low-speed low-intensity bulletin board.
Some people almost exclusively react to others’ tweets, some contribute mostly
fresh little nuggets of wit or wisdom.  A lot of tweets are just a link with a
few words of commentary.</p>
<p>I personally use it to post little observations or cool links or minor
snarks that don’t merit a blog entry.  Plus, I’ll ask LazyWeb questions and
answer a few of those from others.</p>
<p>The river-of-tweets I read contains a fairly steady conversational buzz
around camera 
technology and online marketing and general randomness.  
Interestingly, I haven’t found that many really stimulating straight-tech
feeds, the 140-character limit is a problem I guess.
I follow real
people except for 
<a href="http://twitter.com/cbcnews">@CBCNews</a> and
<a href="http://twitter.com/breakingnewson">@BreakingNewsOn</a>.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Why?</h2>
<p>I enjoy it for the background-conversation-hum effect, sort of like being
in a busy coffee shop.  And there’ve been a few times when I’ve got
professionally-important news way before I would have seen it on
another channel, or that I might otherwise not have seen at all.</p>
<p>And, unlike a few other input streams, when I need to focus on something
complex, I don’t really feel any regrets about just turning it off while I do
that.</p>
<p>Finally, to be honest, I find that I enjoy the challenge of saying, in 140
characters or less, 
something worth the one or two seconds it takes someone out there to notice
and read.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>What Does It Mean?</h2>
<p>Late last year I wrote 
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/11/23/Communication">On
Communication</a>, noting with interest that we’re getting new modes of human
conversation on a fairly regular basis.  I’ve drawn one more conclusion since
then:</p>
<p>Since the process of conversation is close to the essence of what it means
to be a human, even small changes in the enabling machinery can have
pretty 
big impacts.  I mean, Twitter isn’t <em>that</em> different from IRC or
blogging; but even that slight delta seems to have found a significant niche
in the ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>@</h2>
<p>When you create an instantly-recognizable, simple, Internet-wide addressing
mode and it shows signs of sticking, well, that’s a big deal.  “@timbray” has
become a significant part of my identity.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Business?</h2>
<p>At the moment, it seems irrelevant that Twitter doesn’t actually have what
you’d call a business model.  I suspect that they could exit in about
fifteen minutes if they felt like selling out, but the smart thing to do, I’d
say, is ride this rocket for a while until someone figures out which way it’s
heading.</p>

<title>Silent Blogger FTP Failure?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Dear LazyWeb: I tried to help my friend
<a href="http://alexwaterhousehayward.com/">Alex Waterhouse-Hayward</a> with
some problems he’s having on his blog, and managed to completely screw things
up.  I would sure appreciate a word or two of wisdom from someone who
understands Blogger.<br/>
<i>[Update: Problem solved.  I created another FTP-only account on Alex’s
hosting service and told Blogger to use that and it seems OK.  I gotta say,
my first serious experience with Blogger has been kinda pukey.]<br/>
[And hey, Alex
<a href="http://alexwaterhousehayward.com/blog/2008/04/grand-master-guru-tim-bray-charles.html">wrote
about it</a>, elegantly.]</i></p>
<p>The symptom is that when you try to upload or publish anything, the
blogger.com “Status” screen says “Publishing files to your blog...” and shows
the little spinning indicator, but nothing else happens.  When I click the
“Show transfer details...” link, nothing happens.  I have looked at the
FTP-settings screen till I’m cross-eyed and tried running FTP manually
and it works fine.  I don’t have permissions to look at <code>/var/logs</code>
on the server to see if there’s any evidence there.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas as regards next steps?  A thousand thanks in advance.</p>

<title>Hack My Mac?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’m seriously considering hacking a Mac, and I’d like your opinion.
No, I’m not talking about software, I mean with a hacksaw.<br/>
<i>[Update: Problem solved.  Mac not hacked.]</i></p>
<p>The problem is, I have this new Pentax K20D that shoots 14.6MP images, and
when Lightroom goes to work on them my poor little Blackbook tends to breathe
hard and whine a lot.  Plus there’s a lot of HD video that’s so far been
write-only and I can’t really imagine that it’ll make the laptop happy
either.</p>
<p>Now, I have a Sun Ultra 20 and it’s a meat-grinder all right, but if I
wanted to use Lightroom on it that’d
have to be Windows, which I prefer to avoid.  Also, I need to use that for
Solaris and some Web work, so I bought a Mac Pro and the Ultra will move
downstairs.</p>
<img src="PS080393.jpg" alt="Sun Ultra 20 and Mac Pro" />
<p>But there’s a problem.  The Mac won’t fit in this nice piece of furniture
we have that makes the computer available in the living room without having to
look at it.  It’s a serious problem; our house is kind of small for a family
of four and there’s really absolutely no other good place for a stationary
computer.</p>
<p>However, there is a solution: cut the handles off.</p>
<img src="PS080398.jpg" alt="Mac with hacksaw" />
<p>Without the handles, it’ll slip right in.  I took a couple of strokes with
Lauren’s hacksaw and sure ’nuff, it’ll do the job.</p>
<p>This does feel like kind of a drastic measure, so I thought I’d ask for
other opinions.
The survey’s now off, but <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/sr.aspx?sm=po1X48C_2bObxNx0UtLcdfhi4UOVW_2bP_2fRqHkQMOfyFCdo_3d">here’s
how you voted</a>.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Solution</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren</a>, who’s much more
mechanically inclined than me, figured out that the space was big enough,
there was just a lip around the front keeping us from squeezing the Mac in.
So she got a saw that wasn’t a hacksaw, and opened up the flimsy plywood back
of the desk.  There was already a hole there for wires and ventilation; now
it’s much bigger.  The Mac slipped right in.</p>
<img src="PS080525.jpg" alt="Macbook Pro mounted in position" />
<p>I only very slightly regret not using the hacksaw.  As for the commenters
who were urging me on, some of you guys are sick puppies.</p>

<title>Lightroom Ping-Pong</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Here’s the short form in geek-speak: Apparently, you can use
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync">rsync</a> to keep two computers
running
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshoplightroom/">Lightroom</a> in
harmony.  The long version is well, long, and digresses into Deep
Vein Thrombosis and Olympic Table-Tennis qualification.</p>
<p>Recently, on a flight back
from Chicago, I sat next to a personable gentleman and we conversed at
length.  He is a survivor of flying-related
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Vein_Thrombosis">Deep vein
thrombosis</a>, something that everyone middle-aged and up who takes long
flights should worry about.  Let me put it this way: If you’re on a long
flight, either swing an upgrade so you can lift your legs, or get up and walk
around every two hours.  Just do it.  Otherwise you might die.</p>
<p>The reason my interlocutor, whose name I never got, was coming to
Vancouver was to chair the
<a href="http://www.ctta.ca/2008/CapilanoTrials/event.html">2008 Capilano
Trials</a>, a table-tennis tournament via which some Americans and Canadians
will qualify for a trip to the Beijing Olympics.</p>
<p>The idea of going to a ping-pong tourney struck my fancy, and I sold it
to the family.  So this afternoon we trundled off and spent a couple of hours
watching elite athletes try for a ticket to China.</p>
<p>I took the K20D and came home with well over a hundred pictures.  These
average just under 20M apiece, and the notion of stepping through them on my
little MacBook to
select the handful of keepers is just unthinkable.  So I sucked them into the
new Mac Pro and holy cow, can that suckah ever run Lightroom.  Pretty soon, I
had the eight I wanted to keep.  Here are two.</p>
<img src="PS080438.jpg" alt="2008 Capilano Trials" />
<img src="PS080455.jpg" alt="2008 Capilano Trials" />
<p>The woman facing you in the top photo is Zhang Mo and she earned herself a
ticket to Beijing today.  The fellow facing you below is Pierre-Luc Hinse and 
he didn’t (even though he won the match in the picture), but he’ll
have another chance 
on Sunday.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Problem</h2>
<p>I want all my pictures on both the MacBook (from which I blog) and the Pro
(on which I plan to edit).  Since I ruthlessly throw out everything that
isn’t either publishable here or of sentimental value, my entire photo
collection is something under 40G in size, so why shouldn’t I always have it
with me?</p>
<p>I poked around the Internet and found remarkably little wisdom on how to
solve this problem.  So, via Twitter, I asked ÜberPhotoGeek 
<a href="http://duncandavidson.com/">James Duncan Davidson</a> what he’d do
and he <a href="http://twitter.com/duncan/statuses/783721478">responded</a>
“My advice for LR or AP
on 2 machines: designate 1 your master. The other is for intermediate
work. Migrate in 1 direction only.”</p>
<p>I got depressed, because I want to edit mostly on the Pro but sometimes on
the laptop, and I don’t see why this should be hard.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Unix Rules OK</h2>
<p>So I poked around to see where Lightroom kept things, and discovered that
on the Mac, it’s all under your <code>Pictures</code> folder.  And I note that
OS X is after all Unix, and on Unix everything is a file, and a Lightroom
catalog is an
<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> database, but dammit, that’s
just files too.  And on Unix, there’s this wonderful marvelous
thing called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync">rsync</a> whereby
you can say “Please make this directory on this machine the same as that
directory on that machine and do it <em>really damn efficiently</em>”.</p>
<p>Because I’d set up the Pro with
<a href="http://www.apple.com/pro/tips/migration.html">Migration
Assistant</a>, its Lightroom universe and my MacBook’s started out about the
same; after which I’d edited all the ping-pong pictures.  So I poked around the
<code>rsync</code> man page and typed this into a Terminal on the laptop:</p>
<pre><code>~/ 513> rsync -avz xenophon.local:Pictures/ Pictures</code></pre>
<p>(Xenophon is the new Mac Pro.)</p>
<p>It ran through those thirty-odd gigabytes in just a few seconds.  I’m in
love.  Well, there were a couple of warnings about this or that, but I decided
to ignore them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> For this to work, Lightroom has to be turned
off on both machines!</p></blockquote>
<h2 id='p-2'>Yak Shaving</h2>
<p>First of all, I had to arrange for the computers to have different names.
You need “Sharing” under System Preferences.  And while you’re there, you need
to enable what they call “Remote Login” and I call “ssh”.</p>
<p>Which is pretty well just a yaklet.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Futures</h2>
<p>So far, this seems to Just Work; the pictures above (edited in LR on the
Pro, exported from LR on
the laptop) are evidence.
Experts will note that the <code>rsync</code> command above is directional;
my <code>rsync</code>-fu is a little stale
but I bet that there’s a way to tell it to just look at both and copy things
both ways to achieve the desired effect, because after all
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Tridgell">Tridge</a> is God.</p>
<p>I’m probably going to wake up in a cold sweat in the wee hours tonight when
the reason that This Can’t Possibly Work dawns on me.  But for now, it all
seems to fit together unreasonably well.</p>

<title>Patricia in Chicago</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I had business in Chicago early last week, and managed to spend a musical
evening with
<a href="http://patriciabarber.com/">Patricia Barber</a>;
this is not hard to arrange there, and I recommend it.</p>
<img src="R0010330.jpg" alt="Chicago Dusk" />
<div class="caption"><p>Chicago at dusk.  Most drivers get a little paranoid
when you roll down your window in traffic and lean out with a camera, but mine was cool.</p></div>
<p>I’ve written here repeatedly about Ms Barber; I might be prepared to argue
that she’s the greatest living jazz performer.  In any case, she’s clearly the
one that touches me the closest.  I have a lot of her records and have
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/06/27/PBarber">been to
in one live show</a> and look for her
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/02/Jazz-2005">on TV</a>.</p>
<p>She’s a Chicagoan and has a semi-permanent gig Mondays at the
<a href="http://www.greenmilljazz.com/">Green Mill</a> cocktail lounge there.
It’s small (capacity 140), dark, intimate, and a little on the grungy side;
totally the right place for jazz.</p>
<p>The live-bar experience was actually a little less intense than that stage
show I took in a few years ago.  The band was relaxed, joking around, fooling
with their solos sometimes past the point where probably they should have.
The drummer was maybe a little too loud for the space and soloed more than was
really necessary.  Michael Arnopol didn’t take his double-bass bow out of the
case, sigh.</p>
<p>But still... the experience was just wonderful.  The quartet has an
effortless ebb and flow that just can’t be replicated outside the live-music
experience.  Patricia’s piano-playing is a revelation, if she weren’t such a
hot singer she’d be on anyone’s list of the really important jazz
pianists.</p>
<p>And in the bar, Patricia gets a little weird, twisting and turning her head
and body (and hands when not actually playing), and interjecting moans and
whoops into the ensemble sections and others’ solos; it actually looks something
like a mild case of Tourette’s.  I thought it added to the intensity and the
vocal interjections were musically very effective, she should do more of that
in concert.</p>
<p>And by the way, the city of Chicago has a tourist attraction it doesn’t
know about.  They told me the show was at nine, so I got there at eight and it
was pretty empty, I got a nice close seat with a perfect unobstructed
view.</p>
<p>By 8:30, the place was jam-packed, standing-room only.  And a lot of the
people there, like me, were tourists.  I heard a <em>lot</em> of French being
spoken, and the two guys next to me were Czech.  The cover was only $7, and
beer was very reasonably priced.</p>
<p>Anyhow, if you’re in Chicago on a Monday and like good music, I’d say you’d
be nuts not to drop by.</p>

<p>The last little while, I’ve been doing a lot of infrastructure shifting,

the highest compliment I can pay, speaking as a fairly hard-core computer tech
type: I have <em>no idea</em> how USB works, and I don’t think I’ll ever have

whatever I’m expecting it to do.  I think syndication ought to be like that,

<h2 id='p-1'>JRuby 1.1 Goodness</h2>
<p>For those of us who <em>do</em> care about Ruby and Rails, 1.1 is good news
because it’s a whole lot quicker and more
robust than 1.0.  
One of the biggest pieces of goodness is Marcin’s
<em>incredible</em> feat of porting Oniguruma, the next-gen Ruby regexp
engine, to Java (I think the Java people ought to look seriously at adopting
it in a future Java SE release).</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Important, Why?</h2>
<p>Because JRuby is really a proof point for the notion of multiple languages
sharing a VM.  The only other serious commercial move in that direction is
Microsoft.NET, and
it really only has 1&#xbd; mainstream languages: C# and then VB.NET, which is highly
discontinuous with the decades of Visual Basic history.</p>
<p><i>[Update: In the comments, I’m getting heat from people pointing at
Jython, IronPython, and so on.  I know about those, but my perception is that
the JRuby/Rails combo is getting commercial uptake faster than any of those
have.]</i></p>
<p>JRuby, on the other hand, is a no-compromise attempt to maintain full
compatibility with a language radically different from Java on a platform
whose <i>raison d'être</i> has for over a decade been running Java
programs.</p>
<p>The reasons why in theory JRuby ought to be interesting to both
communities, Java (they get metaprogramming and Rails and block-based
goodness) and Ruby (they get oceans of APIs, servlets, and a route around IT
bureaucrats), are pretty compelling.  And despite JRuby’s relative youth,
we’re seeing the first wave of commercial production deployments.  So the
experiment as to whether the advantages in theory play out in practice is well
and truly under way.</p>
<p>If it can be done, its importance as an existence proof is profound,
and I would expect the ratio of the number of popular VMs to the number of
popular languages to decline rapidly from its current value, which is very
nearly 1.</p>
<p>If the JRuby project disappoints, it won’t <em>prove</em> that sharing VMs
among languages is a lousy idea; but it will be, at best, disturbing
evidence.  Me, I’m optimistic.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>PostScript</h2>
<p>There was a flurry of griping today on Twitter: Apparently the
<a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2008/public/schedule/full">RailsConf 2008
program</a> contains exactly zero JRuby: no tutorials, no sessions.  Frankly,
this seems deeply weird to me: from the Rails point of view, there are going
to be quite a few scenarios where you might want to consider deploying into
Javaland, just as a practical matter.</p>
<p>However, I’m glad to see that the IronRuby Microsofties are going to be
presenting; I think having Rails on .NET is going to add some interesting new
flavors and spices to the rich red Web-flavored stew.</p>

<title>Sharecropper Alert</title>

<body>
<p>One of the most interesting pieces of the new Google App Engine is the
identity piece.</p>
<p>I quote from 
<a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/users/">The Users API</a> on
the Google App Engine site:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google App Engine features integration with Google Accounts: Applications
can have users sign in using their Google accounts, and know who is using the
application during a session. With Google Accounts, your users can get into
your application sooner by not having to create a new account, and your
application can personalize the user experience without managing its own login
system.</p></blockquote>
<p>... and now you’re a
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/07/12/WebsThePlace">sharecropper</a>
on the Google plantation.</p>
<p>What a devil’s bargain; Google will make your identity pain go away and
qualify a high proportion of the world’s Internet users to use your app.  But
you’re gonna be on the plantation forever; deal with it.</p>
<p>Dana Gardner has an interesting angle on this:
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Gardner/?p=2638">Gangsta cloud wars could
pivot on the traffic-driving power of Google and Microsoft/Yahoo</a>.</p>
<p>I have no idea, just totally no idea, how this is going to play out.</p>

<title>New Computers</title>

<body>
<p>Today, we at Sun had a server announcement, and so did IBM.
Get yer hot links &amp; pix here.</p>
<p>If you want the official story, there’s
<a href="http://www.sun.com/launch/2008-0409/feature.jsp?intcmp=hp2008apr09_launch_read">Scale
More With Less</a> on the Sun site, and it’s perfectly harmless.  But
fortunately, the engineers organized a blog flurry with linkage aggregated by
Allen Packer in
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/allanp/entry/sun_s_cmt_goes_multi">Sun’s CMT
goes multi-chip</a> which has as much geek-level detail as you can possibly
handle.</p>
<p>I’m in California today in meetings on the Sun campus, so for the first
time I wandered by an actual launch event, which involves free food and beer.
Sun’s campus is usually mostly pretty quiet, with the engineers holed up
either in meeting rooms or behind their screens, but the launch drew a
crowd:</p>
<img src="R0010374.jpg" alt="Sun T5140/T5240 launch event at Menlo Park" />
<p>I was amused that the food, and beer even, was lightly patronized, but the
Sunnies had their hands all over the hot iron:</p>
<img src="R0010377.jpg" alt="Sun staff paw over the iron at the T5140/T5240 launch" />
<p>That’s 16 8-thread cores at 1.2GHz in 1U (or at 1.4GHz in 2U), which is to
say <em>a whole butt-load o’ cycles in not much space</em>.</p>
<p>Wow, those
<a href="http://www.sun.com/processors/UltraSPARC-T2/">T2 Plus</a> processors
are supposed to be about low-wattage, high-efficiency, but that’s a
<em>lot</em> of copper glommed onto each of ’em.  Which brings me to the
competition.  You gotta give IBM credit for independent thinking. Resolutely
ignoring the many-core low-GHz trend exemplified by the new T2 Plus, they’re 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/04/08/ibm_595_water/">shipping a
5GHz part</a>.  Yeah, water-cooled, no shit; I’m wondering what all the
pumpage and pipeage and so on must look like, and how many watts one of these
suckers pulls.  I totally think that’s a dead end in processor architecture,
but still, it’s heroic engineering.</p>

<p>I’ve got this new Mac Pro, and the 2G it came with just isn’t going to do
the trick.  Last week, both Lauren and I were in the Valley, at different
Sun meetings.  So one lunchtime, we snuck away to geek-shop.  I picked up 4G
of high-performance RAM at
<a href="http://www.satech.com/">S.A. Technologies</a>, a little memory
specialist that I totally recommend, their prices are pretty hard to beat.  It
cost about $360 including tax.  On
the way back, we stopped at a big tech emporium for some other odds and ends,
and at the checkout they were advertising high-capacity USB disks for not
much; Lauren picked up 8G for $29.99.  That’s quite a pricing spread.</p>

<p>On the plane home from San Francisco, I was sitting among a bunch of
Tibetans who’d been down from Vancouver for the big protests around the
Olympic Torch relay.  I was honoured to be with them.
The day before, I’d been following the action mostly on Twitter: check out
<a href="http://twitter.com/teamtibet">@teamtibet</a>, where they were helping
organize the protests.  Twitter, it’s an activist’s dream. But I couldn’t find
online video or photos of Majora Carter carrying the torch and the Tibetan
flag.  Oh, and China,
here’s a reality we honkies internalized way back when: Imperialism, it can do
wonders for your commercial position and in distracting the citizens from the
regime’s domestic failings.  But on the other hand, the bad PR is just
<em>never gonna go away</em>.  So, you want the upside, you just gotta suck it
up and deal with the image damage.  Public whining ill-suits a wannabe imperial
power.</p>

<title>Nice Ugly New Camera</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A few weeks back, I bought a
<a href="http://www.pentaximaging.com/products/product_details/digital_camera--K20D">Pentax
K20D</a> and now that I’ve taken 500+ pictures with it, I suppose I should say a
few words.  To illustrate, photographs of garbage.</p>
<p>Previously, I’ve run pictures of new cameras here, but not this time.  The
K20D is a commodity, so there are tons of shots all over the
Net.  And anyhow, it’s kinda ugly.  It’s possible to be extremely functional
and also beautiful—consider a violin or a tugboat—but not, so far, in the world
of DSLRs.  The camera is bulbous and swollen and button-infested.</p>
<p>It takes great pictures, but then so do lots of other cameras. 
Saturday morning, we went to
<a href="http://www.granvilleisland.com/">Granville Island Market</a>, and as
we walked in, there was a dumpster just at the right angle for the sun to come
in.</p>
<img src="PS080539.jpg" alt="Garbage at the Granville Island Market" />
<p>Here’s the thing:  Given reasonable light and a stationary subject that’s
not too far away, and a dry location, you can point pretty well any modern
digicam, any size, at it, put it in full-auto mode and press the button and
you’ll get a great picture.</p>
<p>With a decent mid-range SLR like the K20D, you can do the same thing,
sometimes, when the light’s not great and the subject’s not co-operative and
the environment isn’t friendly.  Plus you can go out in the rain.</p>
<p>Here’s some more garbage.  I bet yours doesn’t look this great.</p>
<img src="PS080542.jpg" alt="Garbage at the Granville Island Market" />
<h2 id='p-3'>What I Like</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>You can go out in the rain, it’s super-weatherproof.</p></li>
<li><p>Pros sneer at 3 shots/second, but it feels fast to me.</p></li>
<li><p>Switching all the things you might need to switch before you shoot is
fast and convenient; the ergonomics are much better than I could have done.</p></li>
<li><p>Compared to 
<a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgets/gadgetreviews/news/2008/03/gadgetreviews_prosumerDSLRs">the competition</a>, it’s pretty small and light.</p></li>
<li><p>The selection of lenses is just outstanding, I mean insanely
great.  Of the 550 or so shots I’ve taken, I bet 80% have been with the 40mm
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/04/27/Pentax-P-DA-40mm">“pancake”</a>; it’s a
lovely combination.</p></li>
<li><p>Lots of megapixels let you crop way down when you screw up the
composition.</p></li>
<li><p>The combination of nice smooth ISO1600 and anti-shake means I can
almost always shoot inside without a flash.</p></li>
<li><p>Hundreds of shots on one battery charge.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-1'>What I Don’t Like</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Compared to the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/05/16/PentaxDSLR">previous Pentax</a> and my
little Ricoh, it’s big and heavy.</p></li>
<li><p>Too many megapixels meant I had to buy a new computer to handle the big
honkin’ raw files.  Plus if they’d squeezed less onto the silicon, the
low-light performance would be even better.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-2'>Still Work to Do</h2>
<p>There are pictures that this camera could take but I haven’t learned how
yet.  Consider the following.  Inside the Granville Island market, a shaft of
sun illuminated a heap of green grapes, it looked like a work of one of the
Renaissance’s Old Masters, as if the grapes were casting light on the nearby
faces.</p>
<img src="PS080546.jpg" alt="" />
<p>Sigh.  There are lots of buttons on the back of the camera that I haven’t
figured out yet, and an “Enhanced Dynamic Range” function and lots of other
goodies too.  As long as I keep seeing things that I want to capture but can’t,
I’ll keep thinking about cameras.</p>

<title>OpenWeb and PHP and Women</title>

<body>
<p>I had fun today speaking at
<a href="http://www.openwebvancouver.ca/">Open Web Vancouver 2008</a>, and
even more fun listening to
<a href="http://zak.greant.com/">Zak Greant</a>, who was on just before me.  
He’s a fine speaker, I recommend him for any geekfest.  Here’s what caught my
eye: there were <em>way</em> more women in the audience, proportionally, than
I’ve seen at any Ruby or Rails or Java event.</p>
<img src="R0010406.jpg" alt="Attendees at Open Web Vancouver 2008" />
<p>OpenWeb is a very PHP-heavy gathering, and I’ve
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/31/Zend-PHP-Conference">noted</a> this
PHP-gender linkage before.</p>
<p>Why might PHP attract women?  I can’t see it being anything intrinsic to
the technology.  Lauren suggested that if a community (such as PHP) at some
point gets a reasonable representation of women, the situation might easily
become self-perpetuating, if female geeks preferentially seek out events where
they’re not so rare as to feel like space aliens.</p>
<p>Still, one way or another there’s a lesson here for Ruby and Java.</p>

gift for ’em.</p>
<p>To start with, a few Grape Hyacinths.</p>
<img src="R0010385.jpg" alt="Grape hyacinths" />
<p>Attached to the north side of our house, where the sun never comes, is a
little extra room with a nice porch on top.  We refer to it as the mud-room or
the wine-cellar, depending.  It’s built out of cinder-blocks and ain’t very
pretty.  So we painted it green and then went looking for a vigorous climber
that doesn’t need much light.  This is what we found: a Climbing Hydrangea;
vigorous and much more attractive than cinder-blocks.</p>
<img src="R0010388.jpg" alt="Climbing hydrangea on green-painted cinder-blocks" />
<p>Don’t know what this was, but I snuck up on it when the sun was on the
other side.</p>
<img src="R0010390.jpg" alt="Young shoot illuminated by the sun" />
<p>Now a couple of shots of the magnolia, which appears regularly in this

<title>ISO Fantasy</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>There has been much rejoicing recently at the process whereby, apparently,
an
<a href="http://adjb.net/index.php?entry=entry080409-221633">ISO committee
takes full control of OOXML</a>.
But you know, that story is entirely irrelevant.  It will have no effect on
what implementors of OOXML, including Microsoft, should or will actually do.
The story’s ending will I think be mostly tawdry.   Oh, and I have some OOXML news
that I think is important, but that I don’t think anyone else has
reported.</p>
<p>First, a bit of back-story.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>What ECMA-376 Is</h2>
<p>Microsoft XMLified the internal file formats of the most recent Office
release and cooked up a specification with the help of some, um, “partners”,
and took it to a standards-organization-for-hire, the result being
<a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-376.htm">ECMA-376</a>.</p>
<p>The result is not a particularly good XML document format, and ECMA-376 is
not a very good specification, but it has a really important virtue: it
describes the format you need to read and write to interoperate with an office
suite that Microsoft ships 70 to 100 million copies of every year; there are a
lot of ’em out there.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>What OOXML Is</h2>
<p>The ISO process, brutal and corrupt as it was, has been covered to death by
everyone.  Its output, soon to be known as ISO/IEC 29500, differs from
ECMA-376 in two ways.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There has been a substantial amount of cleanup
of things that were specified in an ugly or broken or stupid way in ECMA-376.
</p></li>
<li><p>There has been a bunch of XML markup added, which is blessed
by ISO/IEC 29500 but not ECMA-376.  We need a name to talk
about this new stuff; let’s call it “The ISO Delta”.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-3'>The ISO Delta</h2>
<p>The important thing is this: <em>The ISO Delta is completely
irrelevant to the marketplace</em>.  It is not implemented in the shipping
Microsoft products.  Microsoft may choose to implement some portion
of it in some future release of some product, or they may not.  Given Office’s
release and adoption cycle, it’s very unlikely that any pieces of the delta
they decide to implement will be widely deployed in anything less than five
years.</p>
<p>Thus, if you write OOXML software and you generate ISO-Delta markup, it
won’t be usable by the deployed base of software.  In fact, we have no
information as to how gracefully Office will react; will it bypass such markup
or explode messily?  I’m not optimistic.  So, implementors <em>should not</em>
generate ISO-Delta markup.</p>
<p>Implementors also need not bother reading ISO-Delta markup, because it is
entirely absent in the deployed base of documents, which in fact conform to
ECMA-376.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>But Isn’t the Delta an Improvement?</h2>
<p>Yes, but that’s irrelevant.  If what we want is a 
<em>good</em> XML Office Document format, we already have one, in the form of
ODF.  OOXML isn’t interesting for reasons of quality or innovation, it’s
interesting because it maps onto this huge existing inventory of high-value
documents.  Well, except to the Delta, which doesn’t.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Spotting the Delta</h2>
<p>So, since ECMA-376 is mostly a dead letter now,
implementors have a problem.  How are they going to spot the ISO-Delta pieces
which they can safely ignore, and focus on the ECMA-376 pieces which
correspond to reality?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that this is covered.  I’d like to
reproduce one of the resolutions adopted by the BRM:</p>
<blockquote><p>Resolution 21: The BRM decides to instruct the Editor to incorporate an informative specification of 
the following, with a reference to it from the Scope:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All XML elements which appear in ISO/IEC 29500 but do not appear in ECMA-376:2006 </p></li>
<li><p>All XML elements which do not appear in ISO/IEC 29500 but appear in ECMA-376:2006 </p></li>
<li><p>All XML attributes which appear in ISO/IEC 29500 but do not appear in ECMA-376:2006 </p></li>
<li><p>All XML attributes which do not appear in ISO/IEC 29500 but appear in ECMA-376:2006 </p></li>
<li><p>All enumeration values which appear in ISO/IEC 29500 but do not appear in ECMA-376:2006 </p></li>
<li><p>All enumeration values which do not appear in ISO/IEC 29500 but appear in ECMA-376:2006 </p></li>
<li><p>All simple types which appear in ISO/IEC 29500 but do not appear in ECMA-376:2006 </p></li>
<li><p>All simple types which do not appear in ISO/IEC 29500 but appear in ECMA-376:2006 </p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This was originally my idea.  Actually, my original idea was that ISO
should simply accept all changes which represented <em>corrections</em> to
ECMA-376, and reject all those which constituted <em>enhancements</em>, since
they’d be irrelevant for the reasons listed above.  I couldn’t sell that, but
there was pretty well no resistance to Plan B, which was to at least make the
ISO Delta obvious.  I (and, I think,
the community of implementors) owe thanks to my colleagues on the Canadian
delegation, and to Brian Jones and Jean Paoli of Microsoft, for getting behind
this and cleaning it up, and to Alex Brown, for deftly making sure it got a
chance, at the last possible moment, to be voted in.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>It’s Kind of Sad</h2>
<p>The coverage suggests that
future enhancements to 29500, as worked through by a subcommittee of a
subcommittee of a standards committee, are actually going to have some
influence on Microsoft.  Um, maybe there’s an alternate universe in which
Redmond-based program managers and developers are interested in the opinions
of a subgroup of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 34, but this isn’t it.</p>
<p>I suppose they’ll probably show up to the meetings and try to act
interested, but it’s going to be a sideline and nobody important will be
there.  What Microsoft really wanted was that ISO stamp of approval to use
as a marketing tool.  And just like your mother
told you, when they get what they want and have their way with you, they’re
probably not gonna call you in the morning.</p>

<cat>The World/Travel</cat>
<title>Maxed</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I travel too much and it’s getting on my nerves and I’m looking for a
sensible way to cut it back.</p>
<p>I love getting face-to-face with people and I like seeing new places and of
course every trip has lots of photo opportunities.  But travel,
particularly by air, particularly in the twenty-first century, is
increasingly irritating and fatiguing; and I’m trying, in the second half of
my life, to take better care of myself.  So I want to do less.
Since I’m an engineer, I’m looking for a quantitative approach.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Introducing the Work/Travel Ratio</h2>
<p>I’m returning from a trip to the SDForum Ruby Conference, which was
perfectly OK.  The trip from Vancouver to the conference (or nearby hotel) is
about four hours, including flying, airport bullshit, and the driving at each
end.  My speech was one hour.  I got in a couple of decent conversations and a
mildly-useful visit to Sun HQ but, realistically, the only part I had to be
there for was my one-hour speech.  So in this case the work/travel ratio was ⅛
or 0.125.  That’s the first one I’ve calculated, and it
looks pretty poor on the face of it.</p>
<p>Let’s consider my February trip to the BRM.  It’s about 15 hours
door-to-door to Geneva via Frankfurt.  I put in a solid forty hours of
in-meeting time, plus another half-dozen hours of useful schmoozing in the
evenings.  So that gives you 46/30, or for a W/T of 1.53; a whole lot
better than this week’s trip.</p>
<p>Even better was last week; face-to-face planning
meetings at Sun.  Eight hours of travel and 22 hours of work, for a W/T of
2.75.</p>
<p>This is a pretty rough-and-ready measure.  But you can’t solve a
problem till you can measure it, and at the moment I have a travel
problem.</p>
<p>On the face of it, I am tempted to resist any trip with a W/T that’s less
than 1.0.</p> 
<h2 id='p-2'>Other Factors</h2>
<p>There are mitigating factors, obviously.  The most obvious ones would be an 
interesting destination or a Really Important meeting.</p>
<p>If I start applying this rigorously, it means I probably won’t be doing any
more trips across oceans, to Europe or Asia, just to give conference talks.
Unless of course there’s a substantial amount of work that can be filled in
around them.</p>
<p>Is this unreasonable?  Suggestions from anyone on alternate metrics would
be welcome.</p>

<p>I plan to re-use that title once each springtime as long as I go on writing
this.  This year, tulips about to open.</p>

<p>Late last summer, Lauren and I got all organized and actually looked through
a tulip catalogue and ordered a bunch.  They’re just starting to open; this
taken on the last day of anticipation.</p>
<p>Once again with the Ricoh’s lovely Macro setting... the poor new Pentax isn’t going to be allowed
any flower shots at this rate.</p>

<p>I had a little slack in the schedule heading for the airport, so when I
left work, I stopped on to photograph a marsh.</p>
<p>This is just north of Sun’s Menlo Park Campus, Route 84 along the edge of
San Francisco Bay between Marsh and
Willow Roads; as that first road’s name suggests, there’s a great big salt
marsh there.</p>
<img src="PS080562.jpg" alt="San Francisco Bay salt marsh from Marsh Road" />
<p>On days when the water’s a little lower than usual, it the smell can get
pretty rich.</p>
<p>Just up the road a bit is
<a href="http://www.menlopark.org/departments/com/parks/bayfront.htm">Bayfront
Park</a>, which is an awfully nice place to go for a walk.  I climbed a 
hill and took a shot up the bayside.
North of Menlo Park, if there’s anything interesting between 101 and the water
I haven’t found it; plasticky housing developments and an occasional outburst
of high-tech, in particular Oracle’s Dark Towers.</p>
<img src="PS080569.jpg" alt="Looking north from Bayfront Park" />
<p>Note the line of transmission towers along the horizon in both
pictures.</p>
<p>Also in the park was this elderly box which may still shelter electrical
equipment.  Nice typography and graceful decay, what’s not to like?</p>

<p>Then I went to the airport and came home to Vancouver, which was suffering
an unseasonable April snowstorm.</p>

<p>A little too much contrast for one day, if you ask me.</p>

<title>Raconteurs Live</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Sunday night (yes, that’d be
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/420_%28cannabis_culture%29">4/20</a>,
which the band noted to general snickers), we took in 
<a href="http://www.theraconteurs.com/">The Raconteurs</a> at Vancouver’s
excellent Commodore Ballroom.  It was nice to get out for an evening of rock
&amp; roll, and there are some great songs, but my feelings were mixed.</p>
<img src="R0010426.jpg" alt="The Raconteurs in performance" />
<div class="caption"><p>Yeah, the picture is grainy and a little blurry and
rough-edged, but then so is their music.</p></div>
<p>As I’ve written before, it’s really great that there’s this guy 20 years
younger than me who is pushing back the edges of a kind of music that I’ve
always really loved.  And while I like the White Stripes, it’s also nice that
Jack is spending time in an actual band with other actual musicians.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Highlights</h2>
<p>Well, for me, the three big hits: <cite>Blue Vein</cite>, <cite>Steady
As She Goes</cite>, and <cite>Broken Boy Soldiers</cite>.  The <cite>Blue
Vein</cite> performance wasn’t as over-the-top as I’ve seen them do it on TV,
but it was pretty impressive, and beautiful in its way.  <cite>Steady</cite>
was much better than the album version, with Jack reaching back for more on
his half of the call-and-response vocals.</p>
<p>Another good thing is Brendan Benson; his singing and guitar are worth
going out to hear on their own, and contrast very nicely with Jack.</p>
<p>As for Jack, the atonal treble guitar squeals that kind of irritate me on
record work better at concert volume; or maybe he’s just got them
better-integrated into his breaks these days.  And he played some really
touching and subtle piano parts.</p>
<p>And finally, the whole band brings a lot, really a  lot, of intensity to
the stage.  It’s <em>very</em> rock &amp; roll.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Problems</h2>
<p>I’ve heard other bands get way better sound at the Commodore.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the evening, I realized one reason the Raconteurs sound
different; neither Brendan nor Jack actually play much rhythm guitar.  Brendan
doesn’t seem to have it in him.  Jack is usually 
tearing off lead riffs, but when he just got behind a rhythm I thought the
whole band sounded better.  I think the band would be improved by a good strong
driving rhythm guitar.  But maybe they like it that way.</p>
<p>The other problem is deeper.  White Stripes is pretty well all Jack’s show,
Meg mostly just gets out of the way.  In a “real” band like the Raconteurs,
what you’d like is for the musicians to <em>drive</em> each other; any serious
live-music fan, and anyone who’s ever performed, knows the feeling when
someone you’re playing with gets really hot and lifts you onto a higher plane
of performance.</p>
<p>Except for, the band didn’t ever really drive Jack, near as I could tell.
There were a couple of times when he was pushing the rest of them higher, but
when he’s playing, he’s extremely inward-facing.  I mean, I’ll pay to go see
him any time he comes to town, but I think it’d do him good to get onstage
with someone who scares him a little.</p>

<title>Multi-Inflection-Point Alert</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I was up late on IM with a much-younger computer programmer
and he asked “Damn, there’s a lot going on.  Is it always like this?”
Well, no, it hasn’t been.  But in the future, it may be.</p>
<p>Near as I can tell, we’re simultaneously at inflection points in
programming languages and databases and network programming and processor
architectures and Web development and IT business models and desktop
environments.  Did I miss anything?  What’s bigger news is that we might be
inflection-point mode pretty steadily for the next few years.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Programming Languages</h2>
<p>Up till not too damn long ago, for a big serious software project you could
pick Java or .NET or, if you really liked pain, C++.  Today you’d be nuts not
to look seriously at PHP, Python, and Ruby.  What’s the future mind-share of
all these things?  I have no idea, but that decision is being made
collectively by the community <em>right now</em>.</p>
<p>By the way, on this subject, check out the
<a href="http://www.ddj.com/development-tools/207401593?cid=RSSfeed_DDJ_All">Interview
with the TIOBE guy</a>; interesting stuff, even though I disagree with some.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Databases</h2>
<p><a href="http://incubator.apache.org/couchdb/">CouchDB</a>.
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/SimpleDB-AWS-Service-Pricing/b?node=342335011">SimpleDB</a>.
<a href="http://labs.google.com/papers/bigtable.html">BigTable</a>.
Need I say more?</p>
<p>No, I don’t think relational databases are going away anytime soon.  But I
think that SQL’s brain-lock on the development community for the past couple
of decades has been actively harmful, and I’m glad that it’s now OK to look at
alternatives.</p>
<p>Will the non-relational alternatives carve out a piece of the market?  I
suspect so, but that decision is being made by the community, <em>right
now</em>.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Network Programming</h2>
<p>CORBA is dead.  DCOM is dead.  WS-* is coughing its way down the slope to
dusty death.  REST, they say, is the way to go.  Which I believe, actually.
Still, there’s not much yet in tooling or best practices or received wisdom or
blue-suit consultants or the other apparatus of a mainstream technology.</p>
<p>So what are they going to be teaching the kids, a few years hence, the
right way is to build an application across a network full of heterogeneous
technology?  That’s being worked out by the community, <em>right now</em>.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Processors</h2>
<p>Moore’s law is still holding, but the processors get wider not faster.
Now that the best and the brightest have
spent a decade building and debugging threading frameworks in Java and
.NET, it’s increasingly starting to look like threading is a bad idea; don’t
go there.  I’ve personally changed my formerly-pro-threading position on this
180º since joining Sun four years ago.</p>
<p>We still haven’t figured out the right way for ordinary people to program
many-core processors; check out the inconclusive results of my
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/20/Wide-Finder">Wide Finder</a> project
last year.  (By the way, I’ve now got an Internet-facing T2000 all of my own
and will be re-launching Wide Finder as soon as I get some data staged on it;
come one, come all).</p>
<p>And I can’t even repeat my crack about the right answer being worked out
<em>right now</em>, because I’m not actually sure that anyone has a grip on it
just yet.  But we’re sure enough at an inflection point.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>Web Development</h2>
<p>Used to be, it was Java EE or Perl or ASP.NET.  Now all of a sudden it’s
PHP and then Rails and a bunch of other frameworks bubbling up over the
horizon; not a month goes buy that I don’t see a bit of buzz over
something that includes the term “Rails-like”.</p>
<p>It seems obvious to me that pretty soon there’s going to be a Rails++ that
combines the good ideas from RoR with some others that will be
obvious once we see them.</p>
<p>Also, that some of those “Rails-like” frameworks, even if they’re not a
huge step forward, will get some real market share because they’ll have some
combination of of minor advantages.</p>
<p>Once again, I can’t say it’s being worked out <em>right now</em>, because
for right now I see a pretty uniform picture of Rails’ market share advancing
steadily.  It won’t last.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Business Models</h2>
<p>Servers, they’re easy to understand.  Blue-suited salesmen sell them to
CIOs a few hundred thousand dollars’ worth at a time, they get loaded into
data centers where they suck up too much power and HVAC.</p>
<p>Well, unless you’re gonna do your storage and compute and load-balancing
and so on out in the cloud.  Are you?  The CIOs and data-center guys are
wrestling this problem to the ground <em>right now</em>.</p>
<p>And as for software, used to be you shipped binaries on magnetic media
and charged ’em a right-to-use license.  Nope, nowadays it’s open-source and
they download it for free and you charge them a support contract.  Nope,
that was last century; maybe the software’s all going to be out there in the
cloud and you never download anything, just pay to use what’s there.</p>
<p>Personally, I don’t think any of those models are actually going to go
away.  But which works best where?  The market’s working that out, <em>right
now</em>.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Desktops</h2>
<p>As I wrote a couple of months ago: how long can the public and private
sector IT management continue to go on ignoring the fact that in OS X and
Ubuntu, there are not one but two alternatives to the Windows desktop that are
more reliable, more secure, more efficient, and cheaper?  More or less
everybody now has a friend or relative that’s on Mac or Linux and is going to
be wondering why their desktop can’t be that slick.</p>
<p>What’s going to happen?  I don’t know, but it’s going to be dramatic once
we get to the tipping point, and I think we’re approaching it <em>right
now</em>.</p>
<h2 id='p-8'>Will It Always Be Like This?</h2>
<p>You know, just maybe.  Our mastery of the IT technologies is still in its
brawny youth, with lots of low-hanging fruit to be snatched and big advances
to be made.  And these days, with the advent of blogs and unconferences and
all those
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/11/23/Communication">new communication
channels</a>, our thought leaders are busy chattering at each other about all
these problems all the time, 24/7/365.  The gap between the leading edge and
technology that’s actually deployed in the enterprise is as wide as it’s ever
been and to me, that feels like a recipe for permanent disruption.

<title>Gaza Truce</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>No, there isn’t one as I write this.  But within the last few weeks, Hamas
<a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/976662.html">offered a ten-year
truce</a> covering the whole region and (separately it seems) a
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7366166.stm">six-month
truce</a> covering just Gaza.  The next story after that’s headline is
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7368502.stm">“Girl killed in
fresh Gaza clashes”</a>, sigh.  Seems to me it might be worth a try.<br/>
<i>[Update: I got a couple of horrid racist comments, which I responded to,
but then lost somehow.  I’ll have to get in and clean up the comment status by
hand; sorry.]</i>
</p>
<p>You don’t have to like Hamas to think this.  Let’s stipulate that Hamas is
full of medievalist religious crazies on the one hand, and old-fashioned
Jew-haters on the other.  Let’s acknowledge that they refuse to back away from
their theoretical goal of wiping out Israel.  
(Let’s also acknowledge that the ugliness is
<a href="http://cpt.org/gallery/album03">not entirely one-sided</a>.)
But still, why wouldn’t you
publicly accept the truce offer, if only (especially if you think they’ll
break it) for public-relations reasons?</p>
<p>There are some not-entirely-insane reasons why one might want to blow off a
truce offer; they’re addressed intelligently in a Ha’aretz editorial
<a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=978121&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=4">Instead of doing nothing</a>.
But still, a truce... after all, the alternative isn’t working.</p>

<title>Ruby News</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This really isn’t the place to come for Ruby news.  But that’s OK, because
I have the pointers to where you should go.  Plus, one of the news stories is
making me think “Smells like Erlang.”</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Where to Read</h2>
<p><a href="http://antoniocangiano.com/">Antonio Cangiano</a> 
has started a regular <cite>This Week in Ruby</cite>, which
seems to hit all the high points.  I’ll expand on a couple of items that
I thought were high impact.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Book</h2>
<p>Hey, there’s a
<a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/2008/04/23/Third-Edition">new
edition</a> of
<a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/rails3/agile-web-development-with-rails-third-edition">Agile
Web Development with Rails</a>, which is good and not unexpected.  I’d kind of
wondered why we hadn’t heard much lately out of Sam Ruby; now we know.
Me, I don’t use Rails myself (I have an attitude problem about
database software).  But lots of smart people do.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>The Summit</h2>
<p>Charles Nutter
<a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/2008/04/ruby-implementers-design-meeting-1.html">wrote
this up at length</a>.  I was there for a lot of it, lurking except for a
one-liner: “twbray thinks trans-Pacific co-operation on test suites would be a big step forward for Ruby.”</p>
<p>What I wanted to highlight was all these teams
getting together online cheerfully and without any detectable attitude to talk
things over.  Kudos to Matz for launching it, and to everyone for pitching in.
I don’t want to go over the top, but with this many teams full of Really
Smart People competing co-operatively to build the best Ruby, well, how
can Ruby lose?</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Erlang</h2>
<p>Check out Charles Nutter’s description of the multi-virtual-machine (MVM)
issues
<a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/2008/04/ruby-implementers-design-meeting-1.html">here</a>
and
<a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/2008/04/promise-and-peril-for-alternative-ruby.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The notion is that multiple VMs in a single top-level VM have no
programmer-visible shared data, so if they want to talk to each other they
need to interchange messages.  Rubinius is furthest along in thinking about
this, and the verbal description of how this works made me think of Erlang.</p>
<p>My experience in the
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/09/20/Wide-Finder">Wide
Finder</a> didn’t particularly make an Erlang-lover, but I sure did come to
appreciate its message-interchange framework.</p>
<p>Now, no dialect of Ruby is ever going to be as purely functional as Erlang
(thank goodness) but I have to say that the notion of this sort of
message-interchange API wired into the language kernel seems like a A Really Good
Thing, as we face the many-core future with woefully inadequate tools.</p>

<p>This will not be of interest to those who are here for the technology; move
right along.  It will also not be of interest to serious photographers, who
scoff at bright pretty pictures of bright pretty flowers.</p>

<p>My personal favorite photographer,
<a href="http://alexwaterhousehayward.com/">Alex Waterhouse-Hayward</a>, has
repeatedly and cogently advised me that contrast is the enemy, and that to
best capture the essence of a flower, you want to get out of the sun.  My
problem is that it’s when I see ’em all lit up that I get photo-lust and go
running for the camera.</p>
<p>So if that’s the only kind I’m going to take, I’ll
just have to figure out how to do it.  These ones make use of the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2008/04/13/K20D">K20D’s</a>
“Enhanced dynamic range” function.  I even took side-by-side shots with the
EDR on and off, and the difference is subtle but real.</p>

<title>PDML + Twitter</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I made a Twitter feed called
<a href="http://twitter.com/PDML">@PDML</a>.  The letters stand		for
<a href="http://pdml.net/">Pentax-Discuss Mailing List</a>, which I read with
pleasure; a high-volume, rowdy, enjoyable gaggle of camera geeks.
One of the things they do is post nice pictures, which are identified with a
subject line starting “PESO:” for Picture Every So Often (and sometimes
“GESO:”, G for Gallery).  @PDML has those posts’ first hyperlink and as much
of their content 
as can be stuffed into 140 bytes.
It’s a nice low-volume Twitter feed, less than five pix a day on average.
I believe this is what the cool kids call a “Mashup”.  A very <em>slow</em>
one, but still.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Is This OK?</h2>
<p>I didn’t ask the PDMLers, nor the Twitterers, nor the other silent
players (see below).  But I don’t expect any static; when you publish a
pointer on the 
Web, I think it’s OK to repurpose it.  A lot of the pictures themselves have
some rights reserved, and are clearly marked as such, which is just fine.</p>
<p>This is one of the Good Things about the Web.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>How It Works</h2>
<p>First, I created a new Gmail account, subscribed it to PDML, and
POP-enabled it.</p>
<p>Then I wrote a little Ruby program to read the mail.  It turns out that the
current Ruby 1.8.6 doesn’t support POP+SSL, so I had to use Ruby 1.9.
The API is pretty simple.</p>
<p>The Ruby program figures out which posts are PESOs, distills out a
message, and POSTs that via
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/web/api-documentation">the
Twitter REST API</a>.</p>
<p>The hardest part was distilling the email content down to a useful 140-byte
chunk.  You have to get the hyperlink and title in, plus the author’s name if
at all possible, and lots of times that still leaves room  to fish around in
the email body for more.
Once I’d written some
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing">fuzzy</a> unit tests, I
lost my fear and just sorted that out.</p>
<p>I saved some space by calling out to
<a href="http://is.gd/">is.gd</a> for URI shortening.</p>
<p>So the Ruby program, now bloated up to a big 103 lines, is running as a
<code>cron</code> job a few times an hour over on <code>tbray.org</code>.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>That’s Nice</h2>
<p>You don’t say.  I had the idea mid-morning on Tuesday, and the basic
structure working by late afternoon. And that’s leaving time for one
teleconference, a visit to my lawyer’s office, and lunch.  It took me till
sometime Wednesday to get the rough edges filed down and things looking
good.  Live testing was very slow, because there are only a couple of PESOs a day
and I couldn’t figure out how to read the post via POP without marking it as
read, so I could use each only once.</p>
<p>I held off a couple of days announcing it so as to build up a few PESOs in
the feed.  There also remain a few tweets which are debugging grunge and
which Twitter failed to delete no matter how politely I asked.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Any Problems?</h2>
<p>Well, it does bother me that I’m not paying for any of this.
I’m using Gmail as a handy POP service and never looking at an ad, which
pretty well nukes their business model.  This is particularly egregious since
I have a few domains where I could set up a mailbox and POP server but that
would be, you know, <em>work</em>, and Gmail is just, you know, <em>there</em>.
I’m using the 
<a href="http://is.gd/">is.gd</a> service similarly.  It doesn’t cost anything to read
PDML or post to Twitter.</p>
<p>Is this a problem?</p>

<p>Last fall, I ran the

operation.  I think this line of work is
interesting, so I’m restarting it.  I’ve got a new computer and a new dataset,
and anyone who’s interested can play.</p>

case a simple Ruby script, run like crap on modern many-core processors.
Since the whole world is heading in the slower/many-core direction, this is an
unsatisfactory situation.</p>
<p>If you look at the results from last time, it’s obvious that there are
solutions, but the ones we’ve seen so far impose an awful complexity cost on
the programmer.  The holy grail would be something that maximizes ratio of
performance increase per core over programmer effort.  My view:
Anything that requires more than twice as much source code to take advantage
of many-core is highly suspect.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Last Time &amp; This Time</h2>
<p>There were a few problems last time.  First, the disk wasn’t big enough
and the sample data was too small (much smaller than the computer’s memory).
Second, I could never get big Java programs to run properly on that system,
something locked up and went weird.
Finally, when I had trouble compiling other people’s code, I eventually ran
out of patience and gave up.  One consequence is that no C or C++ candidates
ever ran successfully.</p>
<p>This time, we have sample data that’s larger than main memory and we have
our own computer, and I’ll be willing to give anyone who’s seriously
interested their own account to get on and fine-tune their own code.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Set-Up</h2>
<p>This time, the computer is a
<a href="http://www.sun.com/servers/coolthreads/t2000/index.xml">T2000</a>,
with 8 cores and 32 threads.  It’s actually slower (well, fewer cores) than the
semi-pre-production T5120 I was working with last time, but it’s got over 250G
of pretty fast disks, which I’ve built a ZFS pool and one filesystem on.</p>
<p>I’ve also staged all the <span class='o'>ongoing</span> logfiles from
February 2003 to April 2008 there, 45G of data in 218 million lines.</p>
<p>It’s Internet-facing, with ssh access and port 80 open (not that I’m
running a Web server yet).</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Want to Join In?</h2>
<p>I’ve set up a
<a href="http://wikis.sun.com/display/WideFinder/">WideFinder Project
Wiki</a>.  The details of how to get started are there.
For now, anyone with a wikis.sun.com account can write to it, which I’m
hoping will be an adequate vandalism filter.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>The First Step</h2>
<p>Before we start coding, we need to agree on
<a href="http://wikis.sun.com/display/WideFinder/The+Benchmark">the
Benchmark</a>; the 13-line Ruby program was an instructive target for Wide
Finder 1, but several people pointed out that this could be done with an
<code>awk</code>/<code>sort</code> one-liner, so something a little more
ambitious might be appropriate.  I’ve made a couple of initial suggestions on
the wiki.</p>

<body>
<p>There was this little flurry of excitement when one of the Silly-Valley
TechWhatever news aggregators asserted that Twitter was dropping the use of
Rails.
<a href="http://twitter.com/ev/statuses/801530348">It seems not to be
true</a>.  This is yet more evidence that the news aggregators are becoming
part of the problem, not part of the solution.</p>
<p>If you want care about Twitter, follow
<a href="http://twitter.com/biz">@biz</a> or
<a href="http://twitter.com/ev">@ev</a>.  If you care about Rails, follow DHH
<a href="http://loudthinking.com/">here</a> or
<a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/">here</a> or
<a href="http://twitter.com/d2h">here</a>.  If you care about Sun, read what
the people at Sun say.  Same for IBM or Microsoft.</p>
<p>If you care about the Big New Thing that’s going to change your life, wait
till it comes and touches your life.  Then you’ll know what it’s really about,
not what some overworked underslept Bay-Area meme-promoter thinks.  If the
news is important, and your eyes and ears are open,
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/27/us/politics/27voters.html?_r=3&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;adxnnlx=1209755093-gjf8jpbJRuS0NCuLZwrlMQ">it
will find you</a>.</p>
<p>The other problem with the aggregators is that there are a lot of smart,
hungry, imaginative people working really hard to game them and get
noticed.  Sometimes it works.</p>
<p>Me, I don’t read hardly any members of any of the top-100 lists.  But I
think I’m well-informed.
If I’m interested in a company or organization, I find an insider or two to
follow.  And I follow a lot of people who are smart and interested in some of
the same things that I am; the effect of feeds and tweets is that we’ve in
effect developed a shared and <em>extremely</em> sensitive radar network.</p>
<p>Isn’t the Internet supposed to be about disintermediation?</p>

<title>Ruby 1.9 I18n and Mashup Testing</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A couple of points on that
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2008/04/30/PDML-Twitter-Mashup">PDML + Twitter
mashup</a>.  First, yet another homily saying “Please unit test”.  Second,
some commenters wanted to see the code even though it’s trivial, and I found a
reason to agree.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>TDD</h2>
<p>I was just sketching this in on a lark, so why, I thought, go all
bureaucratic with 
unit testing?  <i>Mea culpa.  Mea maxima culpa.</i>  A PESO came along that
broke the code, so I fixed it and broke some other code.  On that path lies
madness.  So I did the right thing: looked at the code, realized that if it
were to be testable, it needed to be refactored, and hey, the refactoring made
it better.  And, bloodied but wiser, I wrote the tests for the refactored
methods before I wrote the methods.  Then I just bashed out the methods in the
simplest possible way and fixed a couple of obvious problems and I was
done.</p>
<p>It took less than an hour.  And if I’d done it the right way the first
time, it would have taken less time.  Yes, I <em>know</em> all the good
programmers out there already know that;
I’m just publishing this to punish myself.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Code</h2>
<p>A couple of commenters wanted to see the code.  I thought it was too dumb
and trivial to publish, but then I noticed that <code>pdml-twit</code> uses a
couple of the new i18n thingies in Ruby 1.9, which might be useful as an
example to someone.  First
of all, it begins with:</p>
<pre><code># encoding: utf-8</code></pre>
<p>Then it has some non-ASCII characters in the source code, and callouts to
<code>String#bytesize</code> because the target is 140 <em>bytes</em>.  For
example, one random line:</p>
<pre><code>      extra = " “” ".bytesize</code></pre>

<title>Changing Your Address</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’m tired of typing my postal address into Web sites.  Furthermore, it’s
stupid, wasteful, and a little worrying that so many of them out there have
stored copies of it.  Wouldn’t it be better just to give them the address of my
address?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>[This is provoked by an acronym-heavy discussion that’s sloshing around
online; a good sample of the thinking may be found in 
<a href="http://docs.google.com/View?docid=df9dfsgj_1ghhqgjfq">“Feeds-Based VRM”:
A Web-Centric Approach to VRM Implementation</a>, by 
<a href="http://www.mediainfluencer.net/">Adriana Lukas</a> and 
<a href="http://www.crypticide.com/dropsafe/about">Alec Muffett</a>.]</i></p></blockquote>
<h2 id='p-1'>Your Offline Address, Online</h2>
<p>The idea is this:  Instead of filling your address into a form, you give
them a URI for your address, where a Web site’s server can fetch a
machine-readable version and fill in all the fields.  In the case where the
site only needs your address once, this is worthwhile for labour-saving and
quality purposes; how many times has it taken you three tries to get all the
pieces of your address into the right place on a persnickety Web form, and how
many other times have you noticed a dumb error in an on-file address you entered
earlier?</p>
<p>Suppose the Web site needs to <em>keep</em> your address; perhaps they’re
going to send you something every month.  Then this URI-based approach really
shines, because if you move, then you just change your online address in one
place and then anyone who needs it every so often goes and picks it up when
they need it, and they’ll have the latest version without you having to run
around the Web and change it everywhere.</p>
<p>This seems like a no-brainer, and if you buy into it, there are maybe a lot
of other similar cases.  Here are some other things that you might want to
keep online in one place, control yourself, and deal the addresses of out, as
required: your credit card info, your FedEx account, your health-insurance
number, and your frequent-flyer programs.</p>
<p>Of course some of these get into very sensitive security issues; but
actually we’re getting pretty good at providing information on the Web in a
secure way.</p>
<p>The people who are thinking about this are slinging around
jargon from the “VRM” (Vendor Relationship Management) community and 
from the Identity community.  I’m not really a member of either, and 
thus am probably missing some of
their finer points.  But the notion of you controlling your own automated
information dispensary seems like an obvious winner to me, and furthermore,
one that ought to be easy to build using existing Web technology, right out of
the box.</p>
<p>And you don’t have to be <em>that</em> paranoid about privacy and security
issues to appreciate the advantages of controlling the storage and delivery of
information about yourself.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Technical Issues</h2>
<p>This originally came across my radar because Alec Muffett asked me what I
thought about the idea of using Atom (<a href="http://atompub.org/rfc4287.html">RFC4287</a>)
as a wrapper format for this kind of data.
Off the top of my head, it sounded plausible.  Atom is XML, which
helps with internationalization, and then it also provides you with a
guaranteed last-updated timestamp and a nice globally-unique identifier for
each item.</p>
<p>Let’s focus on that nice simple example: storing your address online.
The first thing you need to figure out is how to encode the address
machine-readably.  From where I sit, it looks like the vCard format is the
most deployed and is thus probably well-debugged.  It comes in three flavors:
plain-text, XML, and an XHTML microformat.</p>
<p>Any of them would work, either on their own or in an Atom wrapper; I’d be
inclined to pick the native plain-text version just for simplicity.</p>
<p>Speaking of simplicity, I guarantee that if this idea got momentum, you’d
hear voices raised arguing that vCard is just too simple for this or that
business’ addressing needs.  Well, too bad, they don’t have to play if they
don’t want to.  My bet is that the upside from bringing order to this chaos
is much bigger than the cost in forcing businesses to dumb down their
addressing data.</p>
<p>So, what would using an Atom wrapper, as opposed to just a naked vCard
resource, buy you?  To start with, you’d be able to batch up
things for delivery; for example separate billing and delivery
addresses.  Or for that matter everything you want to share to drive one
particular transaction: address, credit card, and affinity programs.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there’d be a cost, because you’d have to give the
receiver <em>two</em> pieces of information: the URI of the feed and some sort
of selector for the bit that contains the particular item in question.</p>
<p>While thinking about this, I realized that we never specified a
fragment-identifier syntax for Atom, so in
<code>http://example.com/feed.atom#37</code>, the <code>#37</code> doesn’t
actually mean anything.  Sigh.
I pinged
<a href="http://www.bitworking.org">Joe Gregorio</a> online and asked “Did we
really not do that?” and he replied, more or less, “D’oh, we should fix that.”
Neither
of us can remember the issue ever coming up for discussion during the Atom
process.</p>
<p>So actually, it’s not obvious to me that an Atom wrapper is
a good idea here.  The timestamp would be nice, but then a well-run
Web server should also provide that information.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Take-Away</h2>
<p>Unless I’m missing something obvious, the notion of everyone bringing
the online information about themselves under their own control, using plain
vanilla Web technology, seems like a winner.</p>
<p>What would it take to get this started?</p>

<title>Video Pain</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We’ve had a HD videocam
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/05/08/Video">since 2006</a>, and
have been building up a backlog of unprocessed video, since the stuff is so
huge and slow to process.  This is one of the reasons I recently bought a Mac
Pro.  Things are better, but the story doesn’t have a happy ending yet.</p>
<p>I’ve never really liked iMovie, it seems like it’s trying too hard to be
“easy” and hiding the direct path to where you’re going.
And I’ve sat in on some commercial
video-editing sessions and have an inkling of what’s possible.  So when I
ordered the Pro, I got it shipped with Final Cut Express.</p>
<p>Now, that is a program with a nasty learning curve.  The user’s guide is a
thousand-page-plus PDF, and it’s OK, but not that great.  Too often the
description of how you do something doesn’t end up corresponding with what I
see on the screen when I try to do that; they’ve omitted to mention the
crucial step you need to get to that intermediate dialog box or whatever.</p>
<p>But anyhow, I sat down with an hour or so of HD video shot over the 2006-2007
holiday season and banged my head on FCE till I had it figured out enough to
get what I wanted.  It’s easy to like once the learning pain eases off, and on
an 8-core 2.6GHz Mac Pro with 6G of memory, it’s damn snappy; my first
experience of <em>any</em> video-related software software being
responsive.  It will do way more than I’ll ever need, and what it does, it
does fast; what’s not to like?</p>
<p>One problem is that I’ve been spoiled by Lightroom, which doesn’t have a
“save” button because it doesn’t need one, what a concept.  So my first
extended FCE editing session edited sadly with a crash that cost me a couple
of hours’ work.  Save early, save often.</p>
<p>After a few days of poking around, an hour here, and hour there, I had
things edited down to a pretty pleasing 8-minute movie, with nifty voice-overs
and decent fades and so on.</p>
<p>Then I wanted to cut a DVD, you know, to send to my Mom or whatever.
Which means, I guess, iDVD, a program I’ve always hated.  I don’t know what it
is, it just seems like it’s much harder than it should be.  And I’m
particularly upset that all the “themes” come with Apple branding on the title
page.  Fuck you Apple, this is my film of my kids.</p>
<p>The instructions sure seemed to be simple: export from FCE as a QuickTime
movie, import into iDVD, press “burn”; and indeed I got a shiny silver disk.
But also one minor and one major disappointment.</p>
<p>The minor disappointment is the picture quality; the DVD playback just
doesn’t look anywhere near as good as the raw HD QuickTime on my nice Sun
monitor.  It still looks pretty good, but once you’ve seen better...  The DVD
playback looks weaker not just on the TV, but on the computer screen.</p>
<p>The major disappointment is that the sound is completely borked; but only
on the DVD player, not on the computer.  It sounds like it was all recorded at
much too high a level, so it’s breaking up and distorting in a bunch of ugly
ways.  I review in FCE and I don’t see the levels ever hitting 0dB.  Maybe my
DVD player is the problem?  But I watch movies all the time, with no sound
problems.  Maybe it’s my lame old DVD player, or
because I used a DVD-R instead of a DVD+R?  Maybe iDVD just hates me?</p>
<p>Working on it...</p>

<title>Whatever One</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I spent most of Monday at
<a href="http://developers.sun.com/events/communityone/">CommunityOne</a>,
and it makes me wonder about the future of JavaOne.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>CommunityOne</h2>
<p>It’s really an entirely-general tech-fest, with obvious influence from
Sun, since we pay for it, and heavy attendance by people who will be coming to
JavaOne and decided to show up a day early.  There are ordinary tech presos,
and panels, and an OpenSpace camp for startups, and the RedMonk UnConference 
(also OpenSpace), and I probably missed a couple of things.</p>
<p>I generally liked the unstructured feel of the event: “Throw it all at the
wall and see what sticks.”  Here are a few pictures that I think give a feel
for it.</p>
<img src="PS080683.jpg" alt="People at CommunityOne 2008" />
<img src="PS080709.jpg" alt="People at CommunityOne 2008" />
<img src="PS080712.jpg" alt="People at CommunityOne 2008" />
<p>For me, the highest energy buzz was around the Startup Camp event, but more
or less everything found an audience that seemed engaged and everything.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Future?</h2>
<p>JavaOne is insanely successful; in at least some years the world’s
largest gathering of software engineers.  Furthermore, the Java community is
huge, and still growing.
But other things are growing too, some of them faster.  So should JavaOne
remain a standalone Java-only or even Java-mostly event?</p>
<p><i>[I should emphasize that I’m not speaking for Sun here, I’m not in the
loop on this planning].</i></p>
<p>I personally would like to retain JavaOne’s powerful energy and community
buzz, but I think it needs to become Java-and-Friends, or
Network-Centric-Software, or NonMicrosoftOne, or whatever.  In this context,
CommunityOne is a step in the right direction.</p>

<title>JavaOne Day One</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Whatever your feelings about Java, the opening of the JavaOne conference is
really an outstandingly great event.  I’m not sure if, in any given year, it’s
the single biggest gathering of software developers, but it’s remarkably
huge.
I have some pictures to suggest the flavor of being there, and some specifics
on the Neil Young segment.</p>
<p>As the audience pours in (it takes a while to get 10,000-plus people into a
room), the lights are down, the music is up, and there’s entertainment on the
main stage.  This year, it was a break-dance troupe.</p>

<img src="PS080733.jpg" alt="Break dancers opening up JavaOne 2008" />
<p>I went way to the back of the room to try to capture the feeling of size
and scale.  Those huge video screens either side of the stage are using
some sort of ultra-high-definition, the picture quality is mind-boggling.</p>
<img src="PS080741.jpg" alt="The main stage at JavaOne 2008 from a long way away" />
<p>Then there are a bunch of good-natured hijinks at the opening.  Here’s
James Gosling launching t-shirts into the crowd, assisted by John Gage and
Chris Melissinos.</p>
<img src="PS080744.jpg" alt="T-Shirt launching at the opening of JavaOne 2008" />
<p>As for the opening session itself, it was OK.  There weren’t a lot of
dramatic new announcement this year (well, except for
<a href="http://www.opensolaris.com/">OpenSolaris 2008.05</a>, but that’s not
a Java thing).
The core message, about the consumer-driven technology space, is easy to
believe.  Then there was the annual recitation of mind-boggling statistics about the number
of Java developers, the number of Java downloads, and so on.</p>
<p>You know, those
of us out there in the Ruby/Python/Erlang fringes might think we’re building
the Next Big Thing, and we might be right too, but make no mistake about it:
as of today, Java is the Big Leagues, the Show, where you find the most Big
Money and Big Iron and Big Projects.  You don’t have to love it, but you’d be
moronic to ignore it.</p>
<p>There was a nice pitch for the Kindle by Amazon’s Ian Freed, it’s
mostly-Java under the covers.  And for that use case, Java seems like obviously
the right choice.</p>
<p>I have no idea why 
Rikko Sakaguchi of Sony Ericsson got up on the stage to smile and show a
mildly-interesting promotional video.
In fact, I thought most of the video presentations were kind of lame.</p>
<p>The JavaFX demos were cool if crashy.  I’m still skeptical about the whole
Rich Internet Application notion, to the extent that it means “Like Flash”.
But if you want to go there, I think you’d be nuts not to go all-open-source
rather than get locked into one vendor platform or another; right now, JavaFX
seems like the only option.
And I did think it was audacious to show the JavaFX demo running on
Android.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Neil</h2>
<p>I should open up by making it clear that I’ve been a huge Neil Young fan
for decades; have been to a lot of the shows, including the epochal <cite>Rust
Never Sleeps</cite> tour at Maple Leaf Gardens.</p>
<p>First of all, it was remarkable how well Neil fit into the ambiance.  The
same good-but-faded jeans as everyone else on stage.  The same “white guy from
the middle of the continent somewhere” accent.  The same often-lame
self-deprecating humor.  Scruffy hair and rocker’s shades, well so what.</p>
<img src="PS080755.jpg" alt="Neil Young at the opening of JavaOne 2008" />

<p>So, here’s the big deal: Neil has for decades hated CD-audio digital sound,
preferring needle-on-vinyl.
He thinks the 24/192 sampling rate on Blu-Ray makes a big difference, and
music sounds good again.  So he’s going to be releasing this huge Blu-Ray-only
retrospective of more or less everything he’s ever produced.
The reason he was on stage is that every Blu-Ray player has a Java VM inside
it, and they’re doing some clever things with that for the
retrospective.  First, it’s got this pretty-engrossing user interface, very
much in the Neil Young spirit, moving graphics of rusting autos and spinning
vinyl and creaky file cabinets.</p>
<p>Also, he’s pretty sure there are more recordings and other archival
material lurking here and there in the system, and they’ll be made
available online to people who buy the retrospective, with the built-in code
checking to see if there’s anything to download.</p>
<p>This big roll of paper contains (I think) the
track listing for the retrospective.</p>
<img src="PS080759.jpg" alt="Neil Young with a listing of his life’s work" />
<p>Finally, he’s got Java in another one of his projects; an entry in the
<a href="http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org/">automotive X-Prize</a> attempt
to build ultra-high-mileage vehicles.  His team’s entry is, of course, some
bloated streamlined Detroit creation out of the Sixties.  Obviously, it’s
heavily instrumented and has good telemetry, all Java-based.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, I’ll be doing as much talking as listening at this event.
But I’m glad to be here and sorry to have missed it for a couple of years.
I may not write much Java anymore, but I’m still among programmers, lots of
passionate programmers: my tribe, lots and lots of them, and that makes me happy.</p>

<title>RESTful JavaOne</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I only managed to take in a few talks here and there, but the ones I did
catch sure had some first-rate REST preaching.  To the extent that there’s a
surprising trend at this year’s J1, I’d say it’s REST-is-in,
“Big Web Services” (see below) are out.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Project Zero: Groovy + PHP + Java + REST</h2>
<p>I went and caught Rob Nicholson’s <cite>The Duke and the Elephant: PHP
Meets Java Technology—the Best of Both Worlds</cite>.  He’s one of the IBM
“Project Zero” guys.  I’ve been
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/07/02/Commercial-Open-Source">unimpressed</a>
by the project’s “We can’t be open-source because we’re commercial”
positioning, but it was an interesting talk.</p>
<img src="PS080761.jpg" alt="Rob Nicholson presenting at JavaOne 2008" />
<div class="caption"><p>Rob Nicholson.</p></div>
<p>This part of Zero is called “Project sMash”.
You can write logic in Java or Groovy or PHP—their own
PHP-on-the-JVM implementation.  
I couldn’t quite figure out where you’d use
Groovy and where PHP, and I was puzzled that, unlike other modern Web
frameworks, this thing doesn’t seem to come with a built-in unit-testing
framework.</p>
<p>At runtime, each application crams all this PHP and Groovy and Java and Web
serving and so on into a single JVM, started via a Portlet.
Also, It’s got a multi-level shared scratch data space called “Global Content”
that reminded me of Apache memory-management pools.  Which was, I thought, the
most technically interesting part of the puzzle.</p>
<p>There’s a built-into-the-browser IDE because that’s supposed to reduce
time-to-market, but there’s also an Eclipse plug-in, which is what
Project Zero developers actually use.</p>
<p>The big deal though, was the focus on RESTful Web
Services.  You can annotate your PHP code somewhat like the JSR-311 people
are doing with Java to get the resources and URIs and code connections set
up.</p>
<p>It’s even got a REST-to-SOAP gateway so that you can call out to things
like SugarCRM that are SOAPy.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>JSR 311</h2>
<p>I went to a presentation by Paul Sandoz and Marc Hadley about the work
they’re doing on JSR311 and the Jersey implementation.
I’ve been friendly to this project for a while; it looks like a nice clean
way to help Java developers do REST properly.</p>
<p>The demo was nice and slick; I predict a bright future for this thing.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>SOA @ Overstock</h2>
<p>But the most interesting Web-Service-y preso was 
<cite>It’s All About the SOA: RESTful Service-Oriented Architecture at Overstock.com</cite>
by Sean Landis and Ian
Robertson;
<a href="http://www.overstock.com/">Overstock.com</a> is a <em>very</em>
high-volume online merchant.  They weren’t talking theory, they were talking
about how they’d actually converted their V1 C implementation to a modern Java
version, all running along REST lines.</p>
<p>This and several other presentations opened with a
basic introduction to REST
concepts; my suspicion is that, given all these well-attended sessions, never
before have so many developers received the core REST pitch in such a short
time.  Several people plugged Leonard Richardson and Sam Ruby’s
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529260/">RESTful Web
Services</a> as The Place To Start, but the JavaOne bookstore didn’t have
it.</p>
<p>This presentation included this slide discussing their decision to go with
REST rather than WS-*, which they called “Big Web Services”; I kind of like
that name.  I think it speaks for itself, but there was one nice sound-bite
about REST that I’d like to pass on: “Full control without much complexity.”</p>
<img src="R0010467.jpg" alt="REST-vs-WS-* slide from JavaOne 2008" />
<p>The Overstock system was based on the
<a href="http://www.restlet.org/">Restlet</a> API, which, when I looked at it
last (quite a while ago) I’d found kind of heavyweight and complicated, but I
gather it’s evolved. The code samples looked clean and straightforward, and I
was particularly impressed by how they did load sharing by dispatching
step-by-step along the URI path to different machines.</p>
<p>Their lessons-learned slide was really excellent, but I didn’t capture it
and can’t find it online.  The take-away that’s obvious once you think of it
is that since you can’t possibly deploy all the components of a
distributed system instantly in parallel, version N of each protocol has to
interoperate with version N-1; that way you can roll things out without
breaking things.</p>
<p>They didn’t claim that REST made building this kind of system <em>easy</em>;
just that it was the best alternative for them.  And I enjoyed their attempt
to snatch the “SOA” acronym out of the WS-* swamp.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Down in the big Java One trade-show, there was a “SOA village”, where all
the vendors of SOAP/WSDL/WS-* technology were talking about Governance and
Reliability and Integration and so on.  “Village” is the word all right; a
village left behind by history.  It was kind of sad, actually.  REST may not
have won, but SOA-as-in-WSDL is in the middle of losing.</p>
<p>My second take-away, watching the presentations’ sample code:
there was way too much of it.  When you’ve been living in Ruby-land for a
while, Java’s verbosity starts to hurt your eyes.  In particular those
constructors spilling across two or three lines, festooned with
hideously-nested generics cruft; that’s just wrong.</p>
<p>Having said that, I’m really glad that Java is getting all this REST
machinery, and that the community is developing some best practices, because
it will make Java a much better citizen in an increasingly-RESTful world.</p>

<p>Almost exactly four years ago we launched 
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com">blogs.sun.com</a>.  It’s been a trip, almost
all upside, remarkably problem free.  There’s a bit of new news, both inbound
and outbound.</p>
<p>Our blogging policy arrived on the scene in parallel with the blogs.
For the first time since then, it’s been updated: 
see Linda Sckrocki’s 
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/lskrocki/entry/sun_s_revised_blogging_policy">Sun’s Revised Blogging Policy (AKA Guidelines on Public Discourse)</a>.
Linda is the point-person for keeping the whole thing running; both servers
and policies.</p>
<p>Doing the revision was a little tedious and there were actually a couple of
points of internal disagreement.  It’s really tough to produce something
that’s short and human-readable enough to be useful as a problem
<em>preventer</em>, while at the same time meeting legal professionals’
(entirely legitimate) concerns for i-dotting and t-crossing.</p>
<p>Now, here’s something that I think is actually more interesting and new.
Meet Joanne Kisling:</p>
<img src="PS080789.jpg" alt="Joanne Kisling" />
<p>She’s in our PR group, and leads our work on Blogger
Relations.  I don’t know, she may well be the world’s first blogger-oriented
PR professional.</p>
<p>One of her recent projects was retaining Marshall Kirkpatrick to build the

<title>Java in 2008</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’m glad I went to JavaOne.  I want to go again.  In order of increasing importance:
The Java language is looking stale.  The Java platform is looking
interesting.  And the Java community, well, it’s something special.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Community</h2>
<p>Damn, it’s big: millions and millions.  Let’s assume it’s the
better-and-brighter who come out to JavaOne.  And I’m impressed.  These are
people who aren’t religious and aren’t close-minded and just want to Get Shit
Done.  Oh, and they’ve already got a lot of it done and they aren’t interested
in discarding that investment.</p>
<img src="PS080701.jpg" alt="Members of the Java community at JavaOne 2008" />
<p>Any technology that’s plausibly going to help these people get their jobs
done better, with any combination of less time, better quality, and less pain,
given that it works with what they’ve got, is going to get a fair hearing.
And did I mention it’s big?  The party line claims over six million
developers, and even allowing for marketing over-reach leaves you with a big
number.</p>
<p>Any technology that wants to hit the big-time that isn’t making a pitch for
these people is being unclear on the concept.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Platform</h2>
<p>Lord knows I’ve gone on enough about the difference between the Java
language and the platform.  But the platform, hey, it’s really pretty slick.
After I wrote up the
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2008/05/07/REST-at-J1#p-3">RESTful
SOA preso from Overstock.com</a>, 
I ran into 
Sean Landis and Ian Robertson walking around the trade-show floor.  They were telling me about the latency they were seeing, end-to-end
in and out of their RESTlet-based Java stack, and couldn’t remember off the
top of their heads whether it was 
20 or 40 ms.  I know some people working on complicated Rails deployments, and
let’s just say the latencies are, well, different.</p>
<img src="PS080804.jpg" alt="Java people at JavaOne 2008" />
<p>And you know, the platform’s not standing still; check out John Rose’s
<em>superb</em> 
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jrose/entry/the_golden_spike">The Golden
Spike</a>.  Dissing the JVM engineers would be a symptom of stupidity, and
these guys are biting into JVM-for-everything issues with a vengeance; they
are fortunate to have the JRuby gang serving them up a big, fat, juicy,
co-operative test-case.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>The Language</h2>
<p>I’ve written a ton of Java over the years.  I can still remember how much
I enjoyed learning it (not till ’96 in my case, writing the world’s first XML
parser), how you could fit it all in
your head and how well the pieces fit together and how things Just Worked.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I have to say, I really have trouble with Java-the-language.
I hated generics when they arrived and while I’ve
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2005/07/08/Java-Generics">tried to be fair</a>, I
just haven’t been able to unclench.</p>
<p>But mostly, there’s just Too Much Code.  The job can be done with less, and
increasingly I think it should be.
And I read things like
<a href="http://blog.thinkrelevance.com/2008/4/23/refactoring-from-ceremony-to-essence">Refactoring
from Ceremony to Essence</a> and I know I’m not alone.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>The Future</h2>
<p>If you want to read some <em>really</em> smart words on this subject, and
you have a half-hour to spare, hop on over to Steve Yegge’s
<a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/05/dynamic-languages-strike-back.html">Dynamic Languages Strike Back</a>.
What Steve said.</p>
<p>As far as languages go, higher-level is the future.  As far as platforms
go, I wouldn’t want to bet against Java.</p>

<title>WF2: The Benchmark</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>[This is part of the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2008/05/01/Wide-Finder-2">Wide Finder 2</a>
series.]
A bunch of people have requested the sample
data.  Meanwhile, over at
<a href="http://wikis.sun.com/display/WideFinder/The+Benchmark">the wiki</a>,
there’s a decent discussion going on of what benchmark we should run.</p>
<p>I
particularly liked the comments from
<a href="http://wikis.sun.com/display/WideFinder/The+Benchmark?focusedCommentId=25887354#comment-25887354">MenTaLguY</a>,
<a href="http://wikis.sun.com/display/WideFinder/The+Benchmark?focusedCommentId=25887368#comment-25887368">Preston
Bannister</a>, and
<a href="http://wikis.sun.com/display/WideFinder/The+Benchmark?focusedCommentId=25887443#comment-25887443">Erik
Engbrecht</a>.
(Unfortunately, given the test data we have, I don’t see us being able to follow Erik’s
“non-ASCII” suggestion).</p>
<p>Of the suggestions on offer at the
<a href="http://wikis.sun.com/display/WideFinder/The+Benchmark">benchmark
page</a>, I prefer the last couple.   Session statistics are a little
trickier, and I suspect a bit more resistant to a brute-force Map/Reduce
approach.  And the “normal HTML report” idea is very much in the spirit of
Wide Finder 1, only with a bit more computation involved, perhaps enough to
keep it from being a pure parallel-I/O benchmark.</p>
<p>Your thoughts?  I suppose I’m signed up to build a reference implementation
for verifying output.</p>

<p>I’ve got a gig at

doing a mini-keynote, fifteen minutes entitled
<a href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/schedule/detail/4317">Language
Inflection Point</a>.  This was in my mind when I stumbled across Marca’s
<a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/2008/05/public-speaking.html">Public speaking
versus blogging</a>.  I think he’s really wrong.</p>
<p>His proposition is that you speak at conferences to get written about by
journalists, who will mangle your message, so he’s decided to give up on
public speaking.  Here’s why that’s wrong:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The purpose of giving a speech at a conference is to provide value to
the conference audience; you know, the people who paid money to be in the
rooom.</p></li> 
<li><p>For at least some of us, public speaking is a blast: a monster
adrenaline high, and no matter how many times you rehearse, you always think
of something new to say once you start talking.</p></li>
<li><p>When you give a speech, unless you’re really lame you’ve just had half
a conversation with everyone in the room; quite a few of them will want to
have the other half, so you get to hear enlightening stories from
strangers.  And if it’s an UnConference
or a small crowd, you can have a <em>whole</em> conversation.</p></li>
<li><p>If you agree to speak at a conference that means you’re gonna
<em>go</em> to the conference, and there are very few conferences where you’re
not going to have a chance to learn something valuable.</p></li>
<li><p>If people like what I say, they might start reading the blog.</p></li>

together an expeditionary force, march in, topple them, execute the most

cronyism, corruption, and stupidity, that sort of benign intervention is now
off the table, maybe for another generation.  Thanks, Dubya.

<title>Over Two Thousand</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>That describes the number that appears, on the page called
<a href="http://twitter.com/timbray">@timbray</a>, with the label “followers”.
I’m finding it kind of intimidating, and while I’m no more confident about
What It All Means than I was when that number
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2008/04/02/One-Thousand-Followers">passed one
thousand</a>, I’ve been thinking about it more.  Plus, I thought I’d throw in
some Twittertainment.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Talking to Thousands</h2>
<p>The number of “followers” you have obviously doesn’t equal the
number of people reading your 140-character pearls of prose.  Some of them
aren’t real people, some of them don’t use Twitter any more, and even the ones
who do aren’t online all the time, so they’re quite likely to miss anything I
write.</p>
<p>Still, this number has made it entirely impossible for me to tweet
things like “Cut myself shaving” or “Weather’s lovely” because it would be
idiotic to impose that on maybe hundreds of people.  It feels like each tweet
has to have substance and balance and all that other stuff, just like I want for
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> fragments.</p>
<p>I find that postings of the form “Here’s a way-cool link” have almost
entirely migrated from here to Twitter; the medium better matches the
message.  So there will be fewer
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=tab&amp;as_sitesearch=tbray.org">Tab Dump</a>
postings here, which is on balance a good thing, I think.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I tweet links to some but not all of my 
<span class='o'>ongoing</span> posts, without having a good mental
model of why.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>River</h2>
<p>There’s one thing that’s become terribly clear to me: Twitter is inherently
a river-of-news; when I come back to my computer after a while offline, I have
no urge to look back at the missed tweets.  If it’s important, it’ll come
back.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Management Chain</h2>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/jimParkinson">@jimParkinson</a> is my manager.
<a href="http://twitter.com/SrVerde">@SrVerde</a> is his manager.
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/">His manager</a> is said to be on
Twitter too but doesn’t publish his handle.
<a href="http://twitter.com/MrSun">@MrSun</a> probably isn’t him.</p>

<p>The magnolia is just coming off its riotous pink and purple peak.  So
instead of yet again zeroing in on one or two blossoms, I shot a whole
bunch.</p>

<title>Language-Book Principles</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I have started reading the Scala book (which doesn’t seem to have its own
URL, but is for sale at the artima.com shop) and I have two remarks
on programming-language books.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In any such book, the first example program should print the string
“Hello world.”  There are no exceptions to this rule, except that an
exclamation mark may replace the closing period.</p></li>
<li><p>I am getting really, really bored with factorial and Fibonacci
algorithms.  It is really remarkably infrequent that I implement any code that
looks much like either.</p></li>

<p>By the way, one of the nice things about the

out in a rainstorm without worrying too much.  Particularly nice in this part

<title>Summer Rain</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>It’s different.</p>
<p>It doesn’t sound the same indoors because there are windows open, you
can hear drops in the downspouts and gurgles in the evestroughs.
Today an unsteady drip from a porch staircase railing was hitting
hollow tin,
it sounded like John Cage.</p>
<p>It doesn’t smell the same.  I spent most of my youth in Lebanon, and it
doesn’t rain there between April-ish and October-ish.  The first fall
rainstorm is a really big deal, and the smell, all those months of dust
suddenly wet, I’ll never forget it.  Pacific-northwest summer rain has a bit
of that.</p>
<p>It doesn’t look the same because there’s more light and colour behind
the drops; now the first red roses and rhododendrons are starting their
statements.</p>
<p>It doesn’t feel the same because after the dark months you don’t want to
wear anything heavy or impermeable, so you get wet.</p>
<p>And smile.</p>

<title>Nice Camera Bag</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I’ve been carrying cameras around for a while in a bag that I hated;
awkward to open, awkward to get into, ugly, big outside and small inside.  So
the other day I picked up this little canvas National-Geographic-branded bag
made by Bogen Imaging,
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ng-2343">model NG-2343</a>.</p>
<img src="bag.jpg" alt="NG-2343 camera bag" />
<p>It’s really compact, smaller than the picture makes it look, with
good use of internal space.  I can get the K20D in with any 
combination of two other lenses unless they’re the hulking
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/11/15/Sigma-30mm-F1-4">Sigma f1.4</a> and the
big old Tamron telephoto; and still unobtrusive.  This is another advantage of
shooting with prime lenses.  If you’ve got a D3 or want to carry a couple of
honkin’ zooms around, forget it.</p>
<p>The main lid is fastened with a couple of those old-fashioned metal
snaps and you can have it open in a flash.  Under that is the weatherproof
shell that you zip closed if there’s weather, otherwise you roll and velcro
out of the way.  So you can get at the camera PDQ.</p>
<p>Plus, there are lots of little extra pockets and pouches.  Recommended.
Now, I just need to get it smudged and beat-up for that authentic
photojournalist look. I’m thinking bloodstains.</p>

<title>Time Capsule Pain</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I ran out and bought a 1TB Apple
<a href="http://www.apple.com/timecapsule/">Time Capsule</a>, 
breaking a self-imposed rule: Never buy release 1.0 of <em>anything</em> from
Apple.  Now I’m being punished.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Good</h2>
<p>I thought that the Time Capsule software was the single best thing about
the “Leopard” 10.5 release of OS X; for the first time in many years, changing
the landscape I wrote up in
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/31/Data-Protection">Protecting
Your Data</a>.
I used it and restored a couple of things and it Just Worked.  Good on ya,
Apple.</p>
<p>So when Time Capsule came along, I thought it was massive extra goodness, the kind of thing I wish I’d been smart enough to think
of.  This one box supplies your WiFi and silently, unobtrusively, takes care
of your Time Machine needs.  Easy zero-intervention data safety; what’s not
to like?</p>
<p>(And indeed, I have to say the Time Capsule is a great WiFi station.  802.11n, WPA
not WEP, strong signal, good reach, Just Works.)</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>The Bad and the Ugly</h2>
<p>It’s fragile and unreliable and noisy and scary:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>That sucker runs <em>hot</em> and buzzes; hearing it and touching it
makes me nervous about my data.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s not unobtrusive; you need to keep an eye on the Time Capsule
status in your menubar, because if I sleep when it’s running and then try to
wake up somewhere else, sometimes I get the eternal beach-ball and thus a
forced reboot.</p></li>
<li><p>A few weeks ago, backups started failing with a useless error message
and no other evidence.  The wonderful Sun Mac-users mailing list said
“Reboot.”  That did it.  Smells like Windows.</p></li>
<li><p>The other day, my MacBook started crashing every time Time Machine woke
up.  A little googling revealed that it’s not just me.  I had to move aside
the existing backup on the Time Capsule and start again.  My backup is 105G
and I foolishly started doing it over the WiFi as opposed to plugging in a
wire, and after it ran for 90G and ten hours, it failed for no particular
reason.  It went a lot quicker and completed successfully when I plugged in a
Cat5.</p></li>
<li><p>Lots of people are reporting lots of other problems, particularly with the
“exclude files” options.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So... if you’re using Time Machine, and thinking about getting a Time
Capsule to automate the process, I’d suggest hanging on a few more months and
a few more updates.  It’s still a great idea and I’m sure they’ll eventually
get it right.</p>

Let’s end with three “Menton” tulip photos; they’re of a colour
that I don’t think English has a word for, although “flesh” might do if you
limited your flesh-tones to the European spectrum.  Anyhow, I think I saved
the best for the last.</p>

that fleshy cup. It was really hard trying to get a picture; light and focus
problems.  Next year I’ll try again.</p>

<title>Moonstruck Camembert</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>We had a few people over Saturday on an impromptu basis to watch the first
game of the Stanley Cup (poor Pittsburgh).  Because we’re effete West Coast
New Age types, we had barbecued salmon and pita and dips and excellent white
wine, and something new, a Grey Monk
<a href="http://www.winebc.com/vqadefined.php">VQA</a> rosé, which was not
superb but perfectly OK.   All this goes just fine with hockey, but
because there were four toddlers and the adults barely outnumbered them, we didn’t get
to see that much of the game.  But the highlight was the cheese.</p>
<p>Cambie Street, our local shopping destination, has been ripped to shreds
over the last couple of years by the
<a href="http://www.canadaline.ca/">Canada Line</a> construction, but that’s
dying down and the merchants are drifting back in.  On the east side between
18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup>, there’s a new cheese shop, artisanal
Canadian cheeses, about half from Québec.  At random, I picked up a package of 
“Ash-Ripened Camembert” from
<a href="http://www.moonstruckcheese.com/index.html">Moonstruck Organic
Cheese</a> on Saltspring Island.
It was amazingly, obscenely good.  Two or three people spoke up out of the blue
along the lines of “Wow, what’s <em>that</em>?” and everyone went back for
more, that little package of soft gooey white cheese was gonzo in no time
flat.  Lauren said “Um, not too often please” because it’s probably like 50%
fat.</p>
<p>Totally recommended, both the cheese and the store.</p>

<title>Twitterbucks</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I like Twitter.  I hope it lasts.
So I want it to have a business model.
This week, I was in a discussion on that subject with really smart people, some even with useful experience.
Afterward, I had a really radical idea for a business model:
Ask people to pay for using it.  Read on for discussion, and a survey.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=_2fhBiuH4evPeYDsp6_2blhIhA_3d_3d">Here’s
the survey.</a>  Take it now or read the article first, whatever.
<a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/sr.aspx?sm=TbqJ3FuA1gygcsUNB_2bROf8itJnWOaczHtXSNkunSVSc_3d">Results
so far.</a></p>
<h2 id='p-2'>But First...</h2>
<p>Twitter is going to have to make their service about as
reliable as the Web in general, so it’s there whenever you have something to
say, and people who care what you say will hear it PDQ.</p>
<p>Here’s a bold prediction: Twitter <em>will</em> do this, and will
do it soon.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>All the Tweets You Can Eat: $5.00/month</h2>
<p>Given a snappy, reliable, Twitter that has a community of a few hundred
thousand, including some combination of the people you want to track and the
people you want to reach, would you pay a few bucks a month for it?  I would,
in a flash.</p>
<p>Twitter is called a “microblogging service”, and while you <em>can</em>
blog for free, people who take it seriously mostly don’t.
I don’t hear much complaining about the cost of blogging.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Variations</h2>
<p>Yes, a charge-to-Twitter would be a barrier to entry, which my pony-tailed
CEO is at pains to say is bad, and he’s right.  So, here some introductory
offers:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Screw it, Twitter has already proven its value.  You wanna use it,
please cough up $30 first for the next six months.</p></li>
<li><p>No charge for reading the Web interface, but you have to pay for
anything involving push.</p></li>
<li><p>Grandfather in everyone who’s already Tweeting on the day the charges
start; anyone who starts after that has to pay.  That’s a very Web-2.0 of
leveraging a community, <i>n’est-ce pas?</i></p></li>
<li><p>Slight variation: Grandfather in the existing user base, but only for
six months.</p></li>
<li><p>Free for everyone, but only for the first month.</p></li>
<li><p>... or, but only the first 25 followers or
followees.</p></li>
<li><p>... or, but only the first two tweets per day.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id='p-5'>Not For Everyone</h2>
<p>Making Twitter a commercial service would limit its ubiquity.  But here’s
the secret: I personally don’t think Twitter will ever achieve the ubiquity of
web browsing or even blogging.  You gotta be a pretty deranged info-junkie to
find it worthwhile in the first place.  Fortunately, between the worlds of
technology, politics, and finance (just the ones I know about), there is a
pretty big population thus deranged, and they are the kind of people who
are most likely to pay anyhow.</p>
<p>Yeah, you won’t get the penniless high-school students.
That doesn’t feel like a fatal flaw to me.</p>

<p>The back porch door was open and our adorable little almost-two-year-old,
all golden curls and pink dimples, was wandering in and out.  One time as she
was coming in, I noticed Marlowe the cat was sort of hovering around her; then
the air was full of female shrieks: “She’s got a <em>dead rat</em>!”  And so
she did, holding it up all eager to please, while Marlowe looked confused and
irritated.  A fair-sized one too, with a good five inches of dangling tail.
A few seconds later, she was just as confused and irritated as Marlowe,
for the same
reason, and the corpse was headed for disposal.</p>
<p>(Well, yes, we have two healthy cats that go outside, and this is a
waterfront city thus will always have rats, and our cats are well-fed so they
bring their prizes home to the back porch to show off.)</p>

<title>WF2: First Pathetic Results</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>[This is part of the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2008/05/01/Wide-Finder-2">Wide Finder 2</a>
series.]  I made a couple of little changes to the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2008/05/22/WF-Benchmark-Strawman">Strawman
Benchmark</a> and let ’er rip on the big 45Gig data set.  The results were
miserable, but instructive.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Just How Miserable?</h2>
<p>29:31:30 elapsed, 29:30:52 CPU, i.e. it maxed one of the T2000’s 32 CPUs.
That’s one <em>day</em> plus five hours and change.  Ouch!</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Small lessons</h2>
<p>First of all, it was just using Ruby-by-default-out-of-the-box.
As
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2008/05/22/WF-Benchmark-Strawman#c1211521663.324677">Haik
pointed out</a>, there’s a SPARC-optimized version available from Sun and I’ll
install that.</p>
<p>Second, the code computes the various top-10 lists (hits, bytes, clients)
by storing the numbers in a hash and running <code>Enumerable#sort_by</code>.
It says right in the docs for that function that it’s inefficient.  Still, it
wasn’t too bad for sorting hashes keyed by <span class='o'>ongoing</span>
resources, because there are only a few thousand of those.  
But when it sorted the hash keyed by the hostnames that had fetched resources,
well... it wasn’t pretty.  The <code>sort_by</code> call took
hours.</p>
<p>It was made worse by a programming error on my part; several people pointed
out that one couldn’t diff the program output because if several of the top
entries had the same numeric value, they could show up in arbitrary order.  I
simply changed the code to sort on the value, then the key.  Of course, I
stupidly didn’t take out the old sort, so it ended up sorting twice.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I’ve changed the code to do a single <code>O(N)</code> scan
through the big hashes, rather than sort them.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Big Lessons</h2>
<p>The naive Ruby code is making terrible use of the machine.  Over the course
of the run, it uses, on average, 3.2% of the available CPU resources, and 3.8%
of the available memory.</p>
<p>If you look at the
<a href="http://wikis.sun.com/display/WideFinder/Infrastructure">Bonnie
results</a>, this sucker can do simple block I/O at about 150M/second at a
cost of about 75% of one CPU.  So you ought to be able to plow through the
45G dataset in under five minutes, leaving 31 CPUs to do the actual work, even
without fancy <code>mmap()</code> tricks.  I bet somebody will write a WF2
implementation that runs in about five minutes as opposed to 29 hours.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Next Steps</h2>
<p>I’m going to re-run the cleaned-up Ruby code with the SPARC-optimized MRI
and propose that as the baseline benchmark for WF2 implementations to beat.
Then the fun should start.</p>

<title>Enterprisey Goodness</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I tend to liking simple things, and to suspicion of big “enterprisey”
software frameworks.  I am dimly aware that up in the clouds there are
platforms built on platforms built on platforms built on Java, towering
edifices where acronyms like “JBI” and “ESB” and “SCA” live.  Except for, I
could never figure out what they actually, you know, <em>did</em>.  Let’s be honest;
the complexity and the high-level arm-waving about
“Integration” scared me away and I never really tried.  Well, I’ve stumbled
into a closer look and am beginning to think there’s some there there.</p>
<p>I’ve been talking to
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/andi/">Andi Egloff</a>, who lives up there 
among the floating acronyms in these enterprisey clouds.  I asked “Well, what
does this software actually <em>do</em>?”  After some talk he said “Let me show
you what we’re working on.”  Showing is so much better than telling.</p>
<p>They’re calling their work-in-progress “Fuji”.
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/andi/entry/bringing_together_jbi_osgi_and">Here’s
a screencast</a> where they hook together an RSS feed, an XMPP
stream, and a log-file, with an interposing a Ruby filter, using Fuji and a
bit of DSL voodoo.</p>
<p>They’re also thinking of a visual interface;
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/andi/entry/fuji_gui_sneak_peek_fingers">here’s
the same logic</a>, only with little boxes and arrows instead of DSLs.
Personally I prefer the DSL.</p>
<p>It’s all
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/andi/entry/why_is_osgi_on_everyone">based on
OSGI</a>, hmmm.</p>
<p>Now, in a world that already has
<a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/">Yahoo Pipes</a> and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2008/04/30/PDML-Twitter-Mashup">simple Ruby
POP-to-Twitter mashups</a>, one wonders if you need a big honking Java
howitzer to squish this particular ant.</p>
<p>So I asked Andi that, and he said “Yes, but then with JBI you can also talk
to ESBs and other traditional enterprise integration points”.  Which
I’m not sure that YPipes or little Ruby scripts are built for.  I asked him to
show me that and he said they’re going to.  I’m interested; stay tuned.</p>

for my money, one of Robbie Robertson’s best guitar outings ever.</p>
<p>And then there’s The Clash; around the time of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Calling">London Calling</a> they
may or may not have been the Best Rock Band in the World, but to me at least,
they were The Only Band That Mattered.</p>
<p>And on <cite>London Calling</cite> there were <em>two</em> bo-diddleys
right after 
each other: <cite>Hateful</cite> and <cite>Rudie Can’t Fail</cite>.  There’s a
lot of Clash on YouTube, and watching some now I’m reminded of how
unbelievably great they were live.  But I can’t find either of those tunes.
(Well, there’s a
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsZUBpNLGAU">very decent
<cite>Rudie</cite></a> from Joe Strummer and the
Mescaleros).  On the totally-unlikely off-chance that you
like rock but don’t have <cite>London Calling</cite>, drop everything and buy
it now.</p>
<p>Thanks for that rhythm, Bo, and those tunes built around it.
There’ll be someone playing a bo-diddley in a bar somewhere as long as <i>Homo
sapiens</i> draws breath.</p>

<title>Not an OS</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last Thursday I
<a href="http://twitter.com/timbray/statuses/823088211">tweeted</a>: “I strive
to maintain an open mind when nontechnical people talk about the ‘Internet OS’
or ‘Web OS’. Sometimes it's tough.” I got some grumbles by email and I think
the subject is worth more discussion.  Let me be more specific: Neither
the Internet nor the Web is much like an OS.  And even if it were, that’d be
the wrong way to think about what’s going on right now.</p>
<p>I’ve had this argument before. In March of 2007, Mike Arrington and I
shared a stage at a startup event on the Sun campus, and talked about “Web
2.0”.  Mike talked about a Web Operating System, I talked about people and
information and business.  Dan Farber
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=4686">reported ably</a>.
I don’t think either of us convinced each other.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>I: It’s About People Not Technology</h2>
<p>The “Web OS” meme is harmful because it’s about technology.
But the Internet’s killer app is people, has always been, will always be.
Every single step forward has involved finding new routes and
patterns and tools for people to use
interacting with other people.  No exceptions.</p>
<p>At the level of experience, Web 2.0 is about voices being heard.  It used
to be that there was a sanctified high priesthood that was licensed to
publish: Journalists, novelists, and academics.  Everyone else was an
outsider, relegated to Letters-to-the-Editor or Speakers’ corner.</p>
<p>Nothing can possibly be more important than the experience of tens of
millions of people, formerly outsiders, given a voice and an audience and a
chance to join the global conversation.</p>
<p>This has been <em>technically</em> possible since there was an Internet.
The crucial change was when Dave Winer and a few others proved that personal
micro-publishing was fulfilling and self-supporting, by doing it.</p>
<p>Granted, a majority of people don’t publish—but if the world is even
remotely like the population here at Sun, the knowledge that you’re empowered
to do so is an attitude-changer.</p>
<p>Also granted, a majority of people who do publish don’t find big
audiences.  But that doesn’t matter; as Mena Trott was among the first
to point out, “Publishing to fifteen people is perfectly OK if they’re the
right fifteen people”.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>II: It’s About Information Not Technology</h2>
<p>Or to use another label, the Long Tail.  We’re in a world where we expect a
significant amount of the information and inspiration and creativity and
criticism and collaboration and stories and pictures and music and movies to
come from the many at the edge, not just the few at the center.
Yes, there will always be a loud-voiced few at the center, but they’re no longer
alone.</p>
<p>The traffic patterns have changed forever and they’re not changing back.
Language and its flows are arguably one of the defining characteristics of
<i>Homo sapiens</i>.  The impact of all this information redirection on who we
are and what we do is central.  To focus on the technology is to miss the
important point.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>III: It’s About Business Not Technology</h2>
<p>Lots of modern business is all about pumping information.  The classic
example would be finance; banks are giant information pumps with cash
machines at the edges.</p>
<p>Organizations (business, governments, clubs, political parties, religions)
who figure out how to surf the new information flow will succeed and prosper;
those who push back will be swept away.</p>
<p>And it won’t have anything to do with whether anything’s like an OS or
not.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>IV: Nobody Uses the OS Anyhow</h2>
<p>Suppose the Net or Web were OS-like.  So what?  Nobody programs to one
of those any more.
I bet if I asked a survey of 100 high-level professional developers
what was the last time they actually coded a Unix or Linux or Win32 system
call, I’d get a blank stare.</p>
<p>Everybody I know is, as a matter of principle, working in a higher-level
programming environment that goes to great lengths to abstract away the OS:
Java, Ruby, Apache-project C with APR, you name it.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>V: It’s Platforms That Matter</h2>
<p>When it comes to technology, what really matters is the platform you use to
build with.  Looking at your site from the outside, it’s not obvious to a
non-expert (and perhaps not to an expert either) whether you built it with PHP
or Rails or Django or JSF or ASP.NET.  </p>
<p>But the choice of platform that you build
with is incredibly important; in fact, most of the interesting new software
innovations in the recent years have been in platform technology that let you
build something good in less time with less pain that’s more maintainable.</p>
<p>The experience of building something with Rails is wildly different from
that of a Java EE wrangler, which is wildly different still from that of
someone in Microsoft-land.  A common “Web OS”?  Don’t see one.</p>
<p>In another sense, it’s reasonable to consider the Web as a platform; as
Dave Winer memorably said “The platform that doesn’t have a vendor.”
From the business and end-user and administrator point-of-view, this kind of
works; but not from the seats where the people who build the
apps sit.</p>
<p>In still another sense, it’s sane to refer to the browser as a platform;
it’s certainly where a lot of code gets built.  But it’s no more an OS than
Gtk or WPF or Aqua is.  It’s closest to the user but it’s a small piece of the
big system.</p>
<p>The closest you’ll ever get to the essence of the Web-itself-as-platform is
in working closely with HTTP and URIs, for example in implementing the Atompub
protocol.  But most developers working with Atompub will just use a handy library that fits into their
Ruby or Java or C# ambiance, hardly even noticing.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>VI: And Anyhow, It’s Not Like an OS</h2>
<p>The OS is the software that sits between you and the hardware.  In
practice, it offers a set of brutally stupid and complex services for managing
storage and networking and the lowest level of user interaction.
It’s difficult and unpleasant to use.</p>
<p>I’ve used several and even contributed in a small way to one or two.
Neither the Internet nor the Web are anything like one in any important way.
Thank goodness.</p>

<title>San Fran Shadows</title>

<body>
<p>Last week I took a brief trip to San Francisco, and managed to escape for a
walk.  Lots of buildings had interesting shadows on them.</p>

<p>The old parts of San Francisco seem to age with grace, by and large.</p>

<title>Everything On-Line?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Recently I read 
<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/06/02/080602fa_fact_wright">The Rebellion Within</a>
by Lawrence Wright, a long, erudite, immensely informative <cite>New
Yorker</cite> piece about the
internal dynamics of Al-Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood and Islamic Jihad:
Who <em>are</em> these people, anyhow, where did they come from, and where are
they going?
I entirely recommend it.
There’s a problem, though: I read it on-line.</p>
<p>A high proportion of my reading time these days, both business and
pleasure, is spent reading the Internet.  But we still subscribe to <cite>The
Economist</cite> and, whenever I’m about to get on a plane, I try to pick up a
copy of the <cite>New Yorker</cite>; its articles are mostly very good, and
usually there are one or two which are long and meaty; just the thing for an
airplane ride.</p>
<p>The problem was, on a recent trip, that I glanced at the cover of the
latest, bought it there at the airport, and discovered only
after I was airborne that the big meaty piece was that radical-Islamist
story.</p>
<p>Lacking alternatives, I read most of it again anyhow once my laptop battery
was juiced out.  The experience, on paper, was immensely better.
This is not to diss the <cite>New Yorker’s</cite> online presentation, 
as good as any there is; the column width is about perfect, and the
cartoons are inlined artfully in a way that doesn’t impede the flow of
reading.</p>
<p>But for now, paper’s just way better for this sort of long-form
piece.  Maybe that’ll change.  I’m not sure what I’m actually going to
<em>do</em> about this; I’ll hardly pass up a juicy link that I have time to
follow just because it’s also on sale in print.</p>
<p>It’s just that there’s part of me that wishes that the online and print worlds
were perhaps a bit more cleanly separated.</p>

<body>
<p>[This is part of the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2008/05/01/Wide-Finder-2">Wide Finder 2</a>
series.] 
I have now done the first “official” run of the naive Ruby implementation
of the benchmark.  There is some discussion of the code
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2008/05/31/WF-First-Results">here</a>.  The
benchmark is described, and the naive Ruby code provided,
<a href="http://wikis.sun.com/display/WideFinder/The+Benchmark">here</a>.
I’ve started a results page
<a href="http://wikis.sun.com/display/WideFinder/Results">here</a>.
There are already <s>ten</s> eleven other people now with accounts on the Wide Finder
machine, and I know there’ve been results that are hugely better than this
first cut.
Read on for a couple of notes on this first run.</p>
<p>The combination of using the SPARC-optimized Ruby and eliminating the huge
sort shaved over four hours off the implementation time, but the results are
still horrible: 25:24:41 elapsed time, with zero use of parallelism.
The only thing that’s nice is the size: 78 lines of Ruby.</p>
<p>Can you do better on the time without exploding the code size?</p>
<p>An amusing note on the code.  I needed a method to select the ten highest
values (and corresponding keys) out of the hash table without sorting all of
them.  The code isn’t rocket science, here’s the
skeleton:</p>
<pre><code>class Hash
  def top(howmany)
    ...
  end
end
# ... later on
@clients = {}
...
@clients[client] += 1
...
top_clients = @clients.top(10)</code></pre>
<p>I was showing it to a non-Rubyist and he said “WTF is that <code>class Hash</code>
    stuff?!”  I explained and added, “Hmm, I guess I could have just said 
    <code>def top(hash, howmany)</code>”.
    My questioner rolled his eyes.  He had a point I think; Ruby makes you do
    some odd things.</p>
