<title>Gazpacho and Champagne</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Last year, to celebrate my unemployment, Lauren and I had a New Year’s Day
afternoon social, and it was a lot of fun, so we did it again this year, and
I think we’ll go on doing it.  The refreshments are those listed above, plus
hot lentil soup and cheeses and dips, and we didn’t offer desserts but a few
of the guests turned up with ’em and they got snaffled, so I guess we should
in future.  As for champagne, we find that the
<a href="http://www.mumm.com/eng/champ/ch_chrouge.htm">Mumm Cordon Rouge</a>
hits a good price-performance point.
The gazpacho (improvised by Lauren) was just stupendous, got raves all around.
The kids get sent upstairs where there are lots of toys and intermittent
supervision. We had one injury—somehow they managed to pull down a curtain and
the rod hit little Joe on the
head, nothing serious but it was kind of scary when he came downstairs
with bright red blood running down the side of his neck.
Oh, and someone broke the antenna off the toy-racecar remote, and Phil
Mansfield disassembled it on the spot and jacked in a new antenna made out of
the wire off a champagne cork, it worked fine, is that stylish or what?
The crowd included VCs, geeks, businesspeople, neighbours, parents of the
kid’s playmates, and miscellaneous old friends.  The thirty or forty people who
dropped by included only one other blogger, as far as I know, and very few
people who read <span class='o'>ongoing</span>; an 
indication, were any needed, that this public-voice thing is in its early
days.
Plus, Adam dropped off a mix disk labeled “CTI/Kudu (&amp; Others)”
which was just ultrasuede, luscious Boogie Nights Seventies organ funk.
Same time next year.</p>

<p>Hey,
<a href="http://www.xmlgrrl.com/blog/">Eve’s here</a>!
I expect great things.  What she doesn’t highlight in her basic
bio is that she helped invent XML, and has great hair, and is funny.
Oh, and dig her URL.
Now she’s a WordPress geek too; seems to be a growing tribe.</p>
